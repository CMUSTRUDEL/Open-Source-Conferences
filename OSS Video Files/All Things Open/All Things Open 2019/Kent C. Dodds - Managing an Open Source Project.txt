Title: Kent C. Dodds - Managing an Open Source Project
Publication date: 2019-11-05
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Awesome! Youâ€™ve made it big! Youâ€™ve published an open source project and people are actually using it to make the world a better place. Achievement unlocked! Great job! But waitâ€¦ whatâ€™s this? An issue? Oh, itâ€™s just a bug. Pretty quick and easy. Fixed, released, done, #likeaboss ðŸ˜Ž. Whatâ€™s this? A PR? How cool! Waitâ€¦ Thatâ€™s not quite rightâ€¦ Oh, a question! Cool! And another! And anotherâ€¦ ehâ€¦ and anotherâ€¦ Uh ohâ€¦ You think youâ€™ve just sold your soul to this project. You start an open source project to scratch your own itch and suddenly other people start using it and they need your help. This can easily start eating up your time big time and before you know it, your kids/dogs start feeling neglected. Iâ€™ve had to deal with this in a few projects and Iâ€™ve learned a thing or two about work/life/oss balance. I have a few tricks that help you make the project manage itself a bit more while still being friendly and helpful to users of the project. Letâ€™s chat.

hi everyone my name is Kent C Dodds I'm

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:20,300
a software engineer for myself I worked

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,730
for myself as a teacher instructor and

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,900
yeah full-stack JavaScript engineer

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,550
right now am I my biggest thing that

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,500
might be interesting to some of you is

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,449
this testing JavaScript comm and it's

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,769
the biggest and best place for you to

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,100
learn how to test JavaScript on the

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:37,170
internet and my slides you can find

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,350
these here I've got links to tons of

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,950
resources throughout my slides these are

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,239
this is actually just BS code but yeah

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,550
throughout this so you can go take a

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,110
look at those I'm from Utah and that's

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,469
yeah that's all I have to say about that

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,870
I have a wife and four kids and a dog

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,210
and then there are a whole bunch of

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,510
other links in here interesting things

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,750
that you can go take a look at later but

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,400
before we get into the contents of this

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,680
talk I'd like to invite everybody to

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,150
please stand so Ben that did this to you

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,560
yesterday if you went to Ben's talk but

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,570
everybody if you can if you're

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,159
physically able if you want to please

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,439
stand up put your arms out in front you

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,380
like this and squat down and back up

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,119
this is called an air squat air exercise

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,890
if you've heard of that

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,939
so we're going to do 12 of these

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,140
together because your body needs this

00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:34,530
alright and I want you to count out loud

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,530
with me ready one two you can be a

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,640
little louder three four you're doing so

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,740
good five six seven doesn't it feel

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,170
awesome eight your body's like you could

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,270
do this ten should we start over at one

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,680
no just kidding eleven twelve all right

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,360
before you sit down and stretch up over

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,250
your head as high as you can and then

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,540
even higher than that and then stretch

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,640
over one side and over to the other

00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:04,860
doesn't that feel so great like wow

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:08,310
thank you yes yeah that's wonderful

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,140
thank you for doing that with me i yeah

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,780
i don't know always exercise like I

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,590
should but and that's why I give talks

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,849
so that

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,650
get exercise just kidding okay so I like

00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,360
to start out my talks with expectations

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,069
so that you have an idea of whether or

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,129
not you should be on Twitter all the

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,390
time if you're on Twitter then you can

00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:29,129
tweet a picture and then you can feel

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,980
good about being on Twitter it's like oh

00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,780
yeah sharing you know but yeah so what

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,209
this talk is I'm going to talk about

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,480
managing open source projects I've

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:41,400
managed a few and some tips and tricks

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,260
from personal experience so my

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,640
experience is not necessarily your

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,860
experience so this is not a definitive

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,540
guide or perfect advice for all

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,819
scenarios because we're all snowflakes

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,390
that said there are quite a few things

00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:59,760
that I have experienced that hopefully

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:06,390
can be learnings for you and so that's

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:11,370
what the goal of the talk is so just to

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,840
give you a little bit well yeah I'll

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,299
just insert a little bit of background

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,700
for me if you in case you didn't attend

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,250
the keynote this morning I maintain over

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,019
100 packages on NPM or I should say I've

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,400
published over 100 packages on NPM I

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,810
don't maintain them all some of them

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,220
have been deprecated in favor of better

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,680
packages or some of them have been

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,760
handed off to other people who are still

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,370
using the project so they're better

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,739
suited to maintain it but I do maintain

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,319
a large number of packages and it's in

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,459
large part because of some of the things

00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,010
that I do in here that I'm going to show

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,410
you how I managed to maintain those

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:47,280
packages okay

00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,810
oh and this is JavaScript III do all

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,980
things Java so many people are like

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,840
JavaScript NPM all that okay so most of

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:59,430
you it's kind of hard to avoid

00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,780
JavaScript these days aha but yeah so

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,299
most of my stuff is going to be like

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,549
JavaScript tools and things but we lots

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,620
of the things that we talked about will

00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:09,810
apply regardless of what publishing

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,299
mechanism you use for whatever platform

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,590
you're publishing to so to get started

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,780
here are some things that you absolutely

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,419
must have for you to even be considered

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,519
an open source project first a license

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,109
if you don't have a license then your

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,030
project is not open source it is

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,789
actually code that you've pasted to the

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,480
internet and that is different from open

00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,460
source

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,440
so make sure that you have a license

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,790
read through some you know look at

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,830
projects that you think are cool read

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,680
through their licenses get an idea of

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,930
what a license is if you just want me to

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,020
recommend you one I use MIT on all of my

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,640
stuff and it's great code of conduct I

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,940
think that this is a must-have for

00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,200
open-source projects any any open source

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,630
projects where you want to build a

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,340
community of people that are respectable

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,050
to one another which I think should be

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,290
every open source project and needs to

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,180
have a code of conduct so the next thing

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,700
I want to talk about is the project

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,070
scope defining that project scope and to

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,440
finding what done means so a couple of

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,710
things to help you with that a road map

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,600
file I I've used this in the past on

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,880
some of my bigger projects but I

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,530
typically just will create issues for

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,750
the specific things but sometimes you

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,490
have some some vision for the future

00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,130
that's more than just a single issue and

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,200
so having a place where you can spell

00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,570
out these are the goals of the project

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,720
this is what we're trying to to get to

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:34,380
and sometimes having a won't list which

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,390
I guess it's a spelling error but having

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,010
a list of things know like people have

00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,690
suggested this and here are the reasons

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,700
why here links to the issues where we

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,100
have discussions there that helps not

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,960
only you to be able to reference it

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,850
later but also anybody who wants to

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,830
contribute to the project to say oh okay

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,630
they you know they don't want this

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,720
project to be like the next gulp they

00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,740
they want it to be its own thing I bring

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,710
that up because that's actually

00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,990
something I listed in a roadmap once

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:03,060
okay so another thing for helping done

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,660
are helping defining done is

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,090
extensibility so I I don't think that

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,710
you want your project to do all of the

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,600
things like you don't want this to be

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,160
the kitchen sink and not only are we the

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,260
kitchen sink we also wash your dishes

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,200
like you don't want it to be everything

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:22,740
for everyone but you can make it be more

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,710
capable by making it extensible and so

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,240
read acts for example is pretty much a

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,030
done project they haven't had a whole

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,320
lot of like core changes on the projects

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,410
it's pretty actually pretty small as

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,720
well and the reason that it continues to

00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,430
see innovation is through all the

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,960
plugins and and/or the middleware that

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,110
they have implemented and so they have

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,160
this plug-in architecture

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:47,170
makes it easy to enhance and extend the

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,900
capabilities of the tool itself and so

00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:52,060
by doing that not only do you make it

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,400
more usable for other people but you

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,770
also enable other people to innovate on

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,780
top of the thing that you've built and

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,480
so I've got a chat that I did with

00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,100
somebody a while ago on how you can make

00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,520
open source libraries extensible and you

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,870
can go check that out later if you like

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,320
another thing that I want to talk about

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,330
is automation automating the whole

00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,710
process around open source if you

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,010
thought that open source is just like

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,300
you know hitting publish to publish your

00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,800
your code that you've written and then

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,440
going back to write code and then hit it

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,150
and publish whatever you're in for a

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,700
real treat because there's actually a

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,620
fair event more to it that you can

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,480
really save yourself a lot of time if

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,110
you choose to automate some of your

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:38,140
processes so a especially when you are

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:42,550
maintaining a plethora of packages

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:44,950
automation can seriously innit it will

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,960
enable you to do more so through

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,730
automation I've been able to like create

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,740
a hundred little Kent's running around

00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,050
doing all the tasks that are really easy

00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,280
to do automatically so saving time is

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,550
not the only reason to automate

00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,590
workflows a lot of it has to do with

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,940
being able to stay in context with

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,490
whatever you're doing and and just

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,120
continue on let the computers do the job

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,830
so a couple of things for automation

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,780
first off simplify the setup of your

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,210
project if you want contributors you

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,060
don't want them to have to go and like

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,550
install I don't know some crazy huge

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,140
amount of stuff to get going and and

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,690
follow like a bunch of scripts and

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,300
whatever it's a lot better if you can

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,340
just have okay you clone the project you

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,530
go into that project and you run this

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,940
one script and that script sets

00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,440
everything up before you on your machine

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,080
that script will make sure that the

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,220
environment is correct so if you have

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,920
the wrong things installed the wrong

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,540
versions of things installed that it

00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,520
will warn you and say hey would you like

00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,470
to install this whatever the case may be

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,110
and there are tools that you can use to

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,810
help you with that but finding ways to

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,480
make the setup automatic and as quickly

00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,310
as seamless as possible for new

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,030
contributors is really helpful not only

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,160
for the

00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,170
new contributors but also for you if you

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,700
want to you know you get a new computer

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,640
and now you have to go set up everything

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,340
again so a couple of things that I use

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,710
for some of this if you're in the NPM

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,050
ecosystem NPM run all to run multiple

00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,490
scripts in parallel cross C and B is a

00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,260
project that I made a few years ago to

00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,750
make it so that you could have scripts

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,940
that set environment variables that

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,160
works across both Mac and Linux and

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,350
windows and then kcd scripts is a

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,170
toolkit that you can go look into and

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,580
fork it and whatever to have consistent

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,070
scripts across a bunch of different

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,020
projects for lots of automation tasks

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,880
it's a pretty cool tool you check it out

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,860
I wouldn't necessarily recommend using

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,580
it but working it and bending it to your

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,010
own well I think is a great idea another

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,110
thing to automate is quality so if

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:47,950
you're not using ESA in tor prettier and

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:51,130
I strongly advise that you do they are

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:54,070
very simple tools to and I'd get going

00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,390
with and they provide a ton of value and

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,920
I'm not talking about the esn't rules

00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,180
that tell you that your imports are in

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,210
the wrong order because I think that's

00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,770
silly but there aren't actual rules that

00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,320
can save you from a lot of trouble and

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,910
if you're into it type scripts actually

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,530
in Val makes lots of those rules

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,750
unnecessary not all of them but many of

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:13,270
them and it eliminates a whole category

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,800
of bugs so if you're into typed

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,450
languages then typescript is also

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,430
fantastic and that is another way of

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,320
automating quality prettier if you're

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,000
not using prettier I I'm not gonna ask

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,970
for a race of hands because I know how

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,050
shameful it is to not use prettier no

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,750
I'm John I don't want to shame anybody

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,150
but prettier saves you so much time it's

00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,530
a code formatter lots of languages have

00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,480
code for matters these days and I

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:38,470
strongly advise that you just forget

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,610
about the all of those like that love

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,130
that you have for your own way of

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,330
writing code and just use a code

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,670
formatter saves you so much time

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,500
especially when people contribute to

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,320
your project and they don't have the

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,970
same code style as you do having

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,010
prettier in there to automatically fix

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,519
all of the their style just saves you a

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:58,009
ton of time and

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,259
and energy so yeah if you're nitpicking

00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:02,300
on people's code styling in your PRS and

00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,889
then you're not making a great

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,550
experience for them to contribute to

00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:09,709
your project so avoid that so automated

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,480
tests and code coverage so I've got a

00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:13,999
couple of tools in here we've got jest

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,980
for your unit and integration tests

00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:17,329
Cyprus can be really useful especially

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,939
if you want to run something in an

00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:21,410
actual browser so I've used Cypress on a

00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:22,699
couple of my open source projects like

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,759
react components and that kind of thing

00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:27,019
and then I use code Cove and for my

00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,420
coverage reporting so I get the nice

00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,579
badge and they have a really cool bot

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,040
that the will show up in your PRS to

00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:35,899
tell you how the coverage has changed

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,329
for all of my open-source projects all

00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,069
the ones that I maintain

00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:42,439
regularly and currently they're at 100%

00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:43,610
code coverage so I actually don't feel

00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,990
like I need code Cove all that much

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,369
because it's just always a hundred

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,050
percent and just like stick it up there

00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:51,589
because I have that enforced through

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:52,879
jest actually but having it can be

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,309
really helpful especially if you have a

00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,540
larger project that you're trying to get

00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:59,749
time to percent code coverage you're

00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,929
setting husky and lint stage kind of go

00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:04,639
hand in hand to automatically run some

00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:06,230
scripts when people are committing code

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,540
so you can automatically format things

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,920
so check those tools out I don't like

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,679
the poop emoji but this is actually

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,759
their logo for lint stage so that's why

00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:18,379
I put that in there so yeah the people

00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:23,839
who were chuckling or are they like the

00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:25,639
three-year-olds okay another piece of

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,819
automation is to automate your releases

00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,589
I can't emphasize this enough if you do

00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:33,649
no other automation automating your

00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:36,049
releases will save you so much time and

00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:37,879
I'm not talking about like yeah well NPM

00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:39,259
automates it I just hit MPN publish and

00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:41,420
it's automated right that's not what I'm

00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:43,490
talking about I'm talking about you

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,709
merge a pull request it goes into master

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,959
and that gets released automatically and

00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:50,480
what's cool about this is I I probably

00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:53,119
merged half of the pull request from my

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,649
phone and half of my releases go out

00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,649
because I merged something from my phone

00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:00,230
which i think is so awesome and so the

00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:02,179
whole process to getting a release out

00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,220
is we iterate on a pull request until

00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,779
it's something I want to release I merge

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,339
it and it gets released and so I never

00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,139
get the question from somebody that says

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:10,639
hey when is this going to be released

00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,799
because it always is it's just they know

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,410
in a few minutes that's going out and so

00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,389
it saves me a crazy amount of time the

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,220
the changelog is automated and it

00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:23,059
happens through the get commit history

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,699
and I can authorize I merge stuff using

00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:27,739
the squash and merge feature so it's

00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:29,569
yeah it saves you so much time so I

00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:30,919
advise you take a look at Symantec

00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:32,660
release there are other tools to

00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:34,069
automate releases but Symantec releases

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,980
the one that I've been using for years

00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:39,290
and it's literally how I'm able to

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,999
maintain the packages that I do most of

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,189
the packages that I have published in

00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:45,470
the last year are not even I have never

00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:47,299
even touched my machine at all

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,269
I've never downloaded them in the last

00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:52,699
year because of what Symantec release

00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:55,119
enables me to do we're just just so

00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:58,970
awesome saves me a ton of time

00:13:55,119 --> 00:14:01,639
ok so community is a huge part of

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,859
open-source I got into open source

00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,350
because I enjoyed the idea of people

00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:09,049
using my code and I stayed an open

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,639
source because I enjoyed the people and

00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,769
the conversations that I had in there

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,259
and as I got into open source I had no

00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:18,439
idea how impactful and important the

00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:20,360
community would be so I spend a lot of

00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:22,040
time working with people if you look at

00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,419
my github contribution graph it'll show

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,959
you like where you're spending most of

00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:28,910
your time and it progressively goes from

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,730
lots of code some pull requests and

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,019
issues and now it's going to more

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,970
reviewing and merging pull requests and

00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:36,379
and commenting on issues and that kind

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,660
of thing just spend a lot of time

00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:40,100
working with people because you can

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,019
create all the code you want and that's

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,610
great but if you aren't serving the

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:46,429
needs of the people who are using the

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,819
open-source software then you know

00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:51,350
nobody's going to use it so it the

00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:54,679
community matters a great deal so a

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,989
couple of things for community so first

00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:58,730
off for documentation I think lots of

00:14:56,989 --> 00:15:02,059
people see documentation is just this

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,919
API documentation but there are a couple

00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:05,600
of key things that I found to be really

00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,970
effective in the way that I write

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,279
documentation and the first is at the

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,139
top of my repos after all like the the

00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,470
rainbow of badges and stuff that I put

00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:16,939
on all my repos I have the problem and I

00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,549
explain what the problem is that this

00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:20,749
library is intended to solve and the

00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:22,640
reason that's really valuable is when

00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:24,650
people are going around Google

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,510
going around github trying to find the

00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,180
tool that will solve their problem the

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,550
first thing they want to know is is does

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,440
my problem match up with this tool and

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,770
so if you can describe the problem first

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,150
then the people who who identify with

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,530
that problem are going to continue

00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,030
reading and the people who don't are

00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,000
just going to move on and the

00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,350
alternative is if they aren't sure

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,610
whether your tool will solve their

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,700
problem then they're going to file an

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:52,580
issue which is great I love talking with

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,990
people but you get enough of those and

00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,230
it starts to get a little old and and

00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:59,180
you'd rather not spend your time

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,790
explaining to everybody how what

00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,350
problems this tool solves so start with

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,360
the problem you'll save yourself and

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,500
other people a lot of time and then

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,800
after the problem explaining the

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,170
solution because just because a problem

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,240
meshes a problem that some tool solves

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,770
meshes with the problem I have doesn't

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,750
necessarily mean that I'll be happy with

00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,090
the solution that they're providing so I

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,610
wrote this reactor component called

00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:25,040
downshift and it solves the problem of

00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:28,460
autocomplete component or autocomplete

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,920
experiences and like type-ahead those

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,090
kinds of experiences and so somebody

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,340
sees that and they're like okay cool

00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,290
that matches with my problem and then I

00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,240
say in in the solution that this is a

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,740
react component and people say oh okay

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,780
well I use view so I'm going to go off

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,900
and find something that is is for view

00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,820
so explaining exactly what how your

00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:50,270
solute your solution solves that problem

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:53,240
is also critical another thing as kind

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:55,850
of a sub note to this is explain what

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,520
this is not so what is what is your

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,440
project not intended to solve so an

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,530
example of this is I wrote a library

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,410
called react testing library that's what

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,640
the octopus is and we've got a goat and

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,800
if you want those stickers I've actually

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,920
got some so you can come come catch me

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,690
later but so react testing library a lot

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,980
of people can got confused about that

00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,660
because they thought it was a

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,350
replacement for testing framework like

00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:23,780
gest or Cypress and that it's totally

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,790
different different things and so in my

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,770
solution section I say no this is this

00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,230
replaces enzyme if you're familiar with

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,930
that but it does not replace gest it

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:36,020
works alongside so just getting some

00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,610
clarity for people is probably

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,290
first thing that you'd want to have done

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,800
when people are introduced to your

00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:46,340
project then talk about installation so

00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,990
if you say npm install whatever then

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,330
people who aren't familiar with the NPM

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,190
ecosystem like remember that people who

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,320
are coming to your project yours may be

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,260
the first project they ever install and

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,150
so if they don't know about node or NPM

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,920
then they see that line that says NPM

00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,400
install whatever and they're totally

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,980
confused so what I do is at the top of

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,900
that line I just say this project is

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,700
distributed on NPM and that's a link

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,740
which comes bundled with node and that's

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,140
a link and it takes them to where they

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,850
need to go so they know exactly like how

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,670
to be successful in installing your

00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,050
project and if you have other packages

00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,760
that your project relies on I also

00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,890
mention that those are dependencies of

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,590
your project that people need to install

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,580
like peer dependencies for example and

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:31,810
then you talk about the API

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:36,140
documentation and having examples is a

00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:38,090
huge benefit too or a lot of people

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,220
really benefit from having examples and

00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,380
so when you have people ask you a

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,300
question how do I use react testing

00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,100
library with redux then instead of just

00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,810
answering their question in a little

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,720
snippet of code you go off and make it

00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,790
an example to explain that like it's in

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,570
a repo or it's in a code sandbox or

00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:58,460
whatever it is for your that makes sense

00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,810
for your library you make that example

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,790
over there and you give them a link and

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,680
then you put that link on a giant list

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,290
of examples that you have in this page

00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,050
there was one library I maintained for

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,150
about a year and a half that by the end

00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,790
of my time with it had over a hundred

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,260
examples on the documentation page of

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,600
how you use it in these different

00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,730
scenarios and you'll notice that over

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,700
time you get fewer how do I use it with

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,990
this questions because people don't need

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,390
to ask because they can see it on the

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,980
examples page and even when they do ask

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,890
you can really quickly answer their

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,720
those questions and the other cool thing

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,880
about this is that other people in the

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,710
community can start you make it really

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,150
easy for people to create these examples

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,560
themselves so they can start

00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:45,050
contributing to those examples as well

00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,610
another thing is having tutorials blog

00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,130
posts and screen and screen casts and

00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,789
talks are just different ways to get

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,769
your

00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:54,049
our content out there about the library

00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:56,289
how you use it why you use it that's

00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:58,549
particularly useful for your talks is

00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:00,559
getting into the why what's the

00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:03,409
philosophy behind your open source

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:06,649
project why should people give you any

00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:08,899
of their time to even research this this

00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:10,429
library I find that sometimes you'll

00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:12,619
have a talk that's like a 20 minute talk

00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:15,859
and somebody goes through the basically

00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:16,999
the the readme and just okay so now

00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:18,950
we're going to install it we're gonna do

00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:21,379
is I used to do that a lot but I found

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,299
that there's a lot more value in using

00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:25,820
that talk time that limited talk time to

00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:27,259
give people a reason to investigate it

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,700
themselves because most people can just

00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,649
follow readme especially if you're

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,379
structuring it in a way that makes sense

00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:35,359
for them and so use that talk time to

00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:39,320
justify the existence of your library or

00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:41,179
your project whatever it is another

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,820
thing about community is the sites where

00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:44,840
your community gathers and so

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,999
facilitating that gathering will save

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,009
you a lot of time because as your

00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:51,859
project scales and its users you can't

00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:54,499
service all of them and and hopefully

00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:56,029
you you shouldn't have to and so giving

00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:59,629
the community a place where they can

00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:01,789
come together and take care of their own

00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:04,249
problems together is a wonderful thing

00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:06,769
and it saves you a lot of time so having

00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:09,649
a chat I use spectrum dot chat you can

00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:11,840
check that out it's fantastic I find

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:12,919
that in some of my libraries a lot of

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,259
the questions that I'm getting from

00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:19,580
people is stuff like how do I JavaScript

00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:21,200
and so having Stack Overflow or some

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,029
other place where where people can ask

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,379
those more basic questions and it can be

00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:26,419
really helpful you can kind of offload

00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:28,700
some of those things to other platforms

00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:31,429
so that the people asking the question

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,889
gets a good answer and the people who

00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:36,799
are supporting your library also have

00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:39,639
the time to support everyone using

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,919
issues of course I only include this to

00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:45,559
beg you to not turn them off and same

00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,970
with pull requests and we're going to

00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,309
talk a little bit more about those here

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,720
in a little bit another like side tip

00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:53,720
that I wanted to share with you is

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,549
having memorable short URLs and the

00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,349
reason that this is really useful so

00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:00,230
like you have a website or something and

00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:02,539
slash help just redirects to a resource

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,170
where people can can get help with that

00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:04,460
but

00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:07,550
reason that I found this to be really

00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,870
useful is because I I get a lot of

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,220
people who say hey I need help using

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,530
this library and they don't really

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,800
explain what they need help with and so

00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,960
you just say please go here to get help

00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,610
and that page can say this these are the

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,280
things that we need so that we can help

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,990
you best and half of the time like what

00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,540
one of the things that I always have in

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,490
there as a requirement is to have a

00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,380
reproducible example and half the time

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,820
is of creating that reproducible example

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,620
they figure out what the problem was in

00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,600
the first place because they're they're

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,720
trying to extract pieces and it was

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,730
actually some totally unrelated thing so

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,670
having different short URLs that go to

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:46,820
the common links that you're wanting to

00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,080
send people is useful because the other

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,360
members of the community might also

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,590
start and sharing those same URL so

00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,780
that's why it's useful it's memorable

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,670
also you don't have to go to your giant

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,040
list of URLs to copy/paste you just

00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:01,610
remember it because it's really obvious

00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:06,160
where things go okay so let's talk about

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:08,960
issues here really quick so with issues

00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,750
you know an issue is a gift from the

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,330
open source community to you and but

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,730
it's also a responsibility that the

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,910
person who's filing the issue is is

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,830
taking upon themselves and so the when

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,840
when somebody starts using your project

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:27,860
when they install your project it is no

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,530
longer you know just your project it is

00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,660
now a shared project across both of you

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,660
so they're using your code to produce

00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,910
something of value and so you can work

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,890
together through this and so when

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:43,400
somebody files an issue for you it's

00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:45,860
kind of a collaboration invitation and

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,720
sometimes they have no idea what what

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,100
they're supposed to do like where they

00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,420
should go and lots of times they come

00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,270
with the expectation that they're

00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,680
somehow your customer and you deserve or

00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,630
they deserve your your time and

00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,390
attention which you can very kindly

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,010
correct that kind of attitude but here a

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,950
couple of things that you can do with

00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,930
issues that I found to be helpful labels

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,490
of course that's kind of a pretty common

00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,280
thing if you have a lot of issues I can

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:12,680
see value in in labels I actually most

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,150
of my projects have very few issues at

00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,160
least the ones that I maintain regularly

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,059
and so I don't actually use labels a

00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,860
whole lot but if

00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:21,649
you have a bunch of issues I can see

00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:24,110
that being really helpful and one of the

00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:25,999
nice things about that is it gives you

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,370
an opportunity to communicate to others

00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:29,960
that hey I have seen this but I don't

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,299
have time to look at it right now or

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,070
I've seen this and I hope somebody else

00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:37,460
looks at it depending on the type of

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,350
label you place on that issue another

00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,360
thing that you can do is contributing MD

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,980
if you put that file either in the root

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,809
of your project or in a dot github

00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,600
directory in your project then github

00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:48,950
will actually show some UI to the side

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,289
when somebody's making an issue that

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,700
says hey they have a contributing file

00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,139
where you go check that out make sure

00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,080
that you're finding the issue the way

00:24:54,139 --> 00:25:00,440
that it should be filed and and that

00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:03,289
actually helps out some of the time and

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,999
actually if if somebody opens an issue

00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:06,320
and then later you update the

00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:08,240
contributing guidelines and then they go

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,409
to open a new issue github will say hey

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,720
the last time you looked at this issue

00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:13,309
was X date and that has changed since

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,830
last time so go take a look at it again

00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:17,029
and then there's the issue template

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,399
which I find to be a little bit more

00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:23,119
useful where you create this file in

00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:26,029
your project and it will preload the

00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,860
issues with that template and you can

00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:29,119
actually make different templates for a

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,549
different things so somebody clicks on

00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,169
issue like new issue and then they can

00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:35,240
choose from bug or feature or whatever

00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:38,629
so go and investigate issue templates

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,129
they're really helpful a helpful way for

00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:43,460
you to say hey these are the kinds of

00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:46,369
things that we expect people to to give

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,590
us when they're filing an issue because

00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:51,200
it's not just not just your job as the

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,809
open-source maintainer saved replies

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,580
also saved you a lot of time so sage

00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:57,950
replies is just a built-in feature in

00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,860
github it's awesome and I recommend that

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:03,470
you use it and the reason I recommend it

00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,299
is because when you get a lot of issues

00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,190
from people saying hey I don't know how

00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:08,600
to use this library and like it's an

00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,960
incomplete issue you'll find yourself

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,179
saying the same thing many times and

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,860
when you when when people say the same

00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:17,509
thing many times they start shortening

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,369
the thing that they're saying because

00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,320
it's taking them so long to type it and

00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:24,139
when you shorten things that you say

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,529
then it sounds kind of rude and so

00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:29,720
instead of like taking all this time to

00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:30,890
type out the safety pie or this this

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,240
reply and then you can actually

00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,980
save something that's very nice and

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,990
flowery in length we love you so much

00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,370
thank you for this gift of the issue but

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,470
you didn't quite and fill out the

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,270
template so please will you and so you

00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,180
can save yourself you know your limited

00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,180
amount of keystrokes to by making a

00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:48,500
saved reply and and still sound nice and

00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,870
then another thing is get out of the way

00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,550
so a really quick story I was

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,610
maintaining a project called angular

00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:59,930
formally years ago it was really cool

00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:02,480
project for angularjs forums and it was

00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,550
a very common thing for me to receive an

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,240
issue and within minutes respond and say

00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:09,890
I'll have a fix out in minutes and

00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,690
within 10 minutes or last side I haven't

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:14,360
have a fix of the issue and I got all

00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,310
the like people stroking my ego like wow

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,630
you're so amazing how awesome like I

00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:21,590
wish every library was maintained like

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:24,040
this uh and and it felt great but boy is

00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:28,360
that like the first step toward burnout

00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:31,220
so what I started to do was instead of

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,690
respond right away I I kind of build

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,670
this community around the project of

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,350
people who started watching the repo and

00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:38,780
they would get the emails as well for

00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,460
the notifications and if I just waited

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,400
like an hour then one of two things

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,570
would happen some other person who was

00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,990
contributing to the project would

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:50,090
respond and or the person who filed the

00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,440
issue would actually post an update and

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,110
be like oh I actually got it wrong and

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,000
so and I was using it wrong whatever and

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,380
they'll close it themselves so you saved

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,350
yourself a lot of time and a lot of

00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:03,380
stress but you also like it's um a

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,790
community building mechanism by getting

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,050
out of the way another thing that you

00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,910
could try if like waiting an hour

00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,900
doesn't work then you just say hey could

00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,480
you do a little bit more investigation

00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:14,000
and figure out where in the code this

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,110
problem is surfacing and often people

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,360
are up for the challenge sometimes

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,760
they're not and that's okay but lots of

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,760
the times they are so give people that

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,070
opportunity so poor request is actually

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,670
those two look very similar

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:30,050
we've got labels contributing instead of

00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,820
an issue template you have a pull

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:34,490
request template you have saved replies

00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,690
so all of the same things apply get out

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,200
of the way is a little bit different on

00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,070
this one

00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,260
I really enjoyed pressing that little

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,660
green button that says merge that's just

00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,840
a fun experience

00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,400
but you know I think as fun as it is for

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,200
me I get to do it a lot and so it would

00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,630
be really cool if I gave that same

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,330
experience to other people and so invite

00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,920
people to contribute to your projects be

00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,930
maintained errs and hit that little

00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,960
green button that to merge the the code

00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:04,580
so I often will say I think this looks

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,740
good I'd like to have somebody else's

00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:10,040
eyes on this to take a look at it as

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,660
well and anybody else can merge this as

00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,450
soon as somebody else has approved this

00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:17,720
pull request and another thing that I

00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:19,550
recommend is is enable people to make

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,510
the the changes themselves so rather

00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:24,740
than fixing everything just for them

00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,480
give them the resources they need to

00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,100
know how to contribute to your project

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,720
so that's where you're contributing and

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,070
d-file comes in handy you can explain

00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,620
this is kind of the architecture of

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:36,590
things and whatever and then I have this

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,690
make a pull request com that just links

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:41,660
people to a free course that I have on

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:46,190
egghead IO about making a pull request

00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:47,900
to a project on github and so I give

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,340
people that so they can learn about that

00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,600
process because lots of people maybe

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,420
they know get but they're not familiar

00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,100
with the pull requests experience as

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,710
much but this will take them from zero

00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,900
get knowledge to making pull requests so

00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:04,640
I give them that to enable them to to

00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:07,250
solve their own problems okay so on the

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,220
side of getting contributors you you

00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,810
can't do all this stuff on your own and

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,210
you you need to have contributors

00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,250
especially when the inevitable day comes

00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,500
and you're like you know angularjs was

00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:20,120
fun but now I'm all over react that was

00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,950
my life and I had a lot of angularjs

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,840
projects that I needed to hand off to

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,950
someone else and there were some of

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,840
those projects that didn't have any

00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:31,300
community only users no contributors and

00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,740
those projects they actually died

00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:37,970
nobody's using those anymore or the only

00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:41,690
people using them are also using other H

00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:43,610
old technologies and so getting

00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,830
contributors is really the only way that

00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:49,460
you can ensure the life of your project

00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:51,680
so remember your contributor pipeline

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,650
this is a blog post that you can take a

00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:58,450
look at later by Michael Rogers but this

00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:00,909
is what a graphic in that blog post so

00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:03,100
the blue is the Technical Committee but

00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:05,049
then everything else we've got actually

00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,119
outside of this user space is like the

00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:09,129
rest of the world okay so everybody in

00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,600
the world is your potential user all of

00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:13,419
your users are potential contributors

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,369
all the contributors are potential

00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:16,840
committers so the contributors are like

00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:20,320
the people who are actually answering

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,359
questions and maybe making one poll

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,529
request here or there and then the

00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:26,049
committers are the ones who actually

00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:28,629
have commit access and then for really

00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:30,220
big projects like node which is the one

00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:31,929
that this was this blog post was about

00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,109
you have the technical committee that

00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:36,249
makes decisions on like when there's a

00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:37,690
people are disagreeing on how to

00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:39,039
implement something in particular the

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,200
technical committee is the one that

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,499
meets together to figure out the proper

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,149
way to resolve the discussion so

00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:48,460
remember that contributor pipeline

00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:50,619
because if you make any bridge from one

00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,070
to the other difficult then you will

00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:55,330
have fewer people there right and

00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:57,820
getting more and more people into the

00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,799
center of the circle is how you can make

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,590
yourself less relevant which i think is

00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:05,710
important another thing that michael

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:08,679
says in this blog post is he talks about

00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:11,230
how the node projects will give commits

00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,409
access to anybody who contributes a

00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,820
non-trivial change to the the core so I

00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:17,649
don't know how many committers they have

00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,720
like people who have commit access to

00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:22,809
the project but it's got to be a lot and

00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,609
I know that for lots of people that's

00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:25,919
like whoa what if they like mess up my

00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,299
repo or something

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,749
what if they mess up your repo like who

00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:34,179
cares we're using git sits and so we can

00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:36,580
restore things it's not actually all

00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:39,519
that big of a deal and then we can you

00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,200
know block those bad actors so or you

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,340
know if it was an honest mistake and we

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,999
can forgive them and they've learned and

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:48,309
that's awesome so I I found that as I've

00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:50,590
given commit access or freely and early

00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:53,259
to mine contributors that they are way

00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:55,090
more invested in the project like

00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:56,889
there's just something like though that

00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:00,009
mantle of responsibility that you hand

00:32:56,889 --> 00:33:02,019
to these people they start to assume a

00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:03,279
lot more of the the weight of the

00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:05,649
maintenance of the projects which is a

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,590
really cool experience especially for

00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:11,289
lots of these people who are you know

00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,070
wanting to have a positive impact on the

00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:15,580
world I think it's

00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,900
really cool so another encouraged

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,370
contribution don't do everything

00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:23,590
yourself I just want to say that again

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:25,690
look for opportunities to a hand work

00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:28,210
off to other people even if it seems

00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:31,240
like you could get it done a lot faster

00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,530
yourself at which you likely could

00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,570
because you're the creator of the

00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,390
project in the first place or or you've

00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,440
just been working in the code so much

00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,450
but even though you could do it faster

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,260
yourself today you will not be able to

00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:45,670
do it faster yourself versus like a

00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,640
hundred people contributing to your

00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:54,340
project okay so having more people in

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:56,980
there enables you to get more done so

00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,840
here's a quick example of that I had

00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,640
somebody email me and tell me about a

00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,330
bug in one of my projects and I said oh

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,210
yeah like so here's the I mean zoom in

00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,950
on that the code for the change you want

00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:12,450
to make is right here before sure to

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:15,460
follow the contributing guidelines and

00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:17,290
and it actually like it took me longer

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,250
to write this email than it would have

00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:22,540
been to fix that bug in the project and

00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,130
this person's like oh yeah I forgot this

00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,410
is open source I can do that let me let

00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:29,170
me do that really quick and they did and

00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:31,180
it was awesome and this is what they

00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:33,940
said thanks for allowing me to pass my

00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:36,670
first github PR hurdle so painlessly and

00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:40,360
it really is a hurdle for people to get

00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:43,000
into open source and it's like it's not

00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,370
super hard it's not like a hard thing

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,500
it's not rocket science or anything but

00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:50,230
it is a new and unfamiliar thing for

00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,750
many people and so helping do a little

00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:55,360
bit of hand-holding for people to get

00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,830
over that hurdle can do you a lot of

00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,900
good and this person is now contributed

00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:01,300
to other from my projects as well and

00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:04,960
and other projects and it's a really

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,040
rewarding thing very cool I'm just

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,810
throwing this in here really quick

00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,370
please don't commit generated files I

00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,290
think we've moved on beyond this but I

00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:13,570
still see it sometimes so don't commit

00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:15,370
generated files it is confusing people

00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,830
will make pull requests to the generated

00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:20,770
file and you're like I'm so sorry but

00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:22,330
you did it to the wrong file so yeah you

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:26,380
don't need to commit generated files to

00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:28,990
to get it's just confusing

00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:31,380
yeah so roll out the red carpet for

00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:34,360
newcomers helping newbies helps us also

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,850
labels like Help Wanted which is like

00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:39,070
baked into all github repos but also

00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:41,500
good for beginners helps beginners find

00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:43,330
issues that are good for them and then

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,390
first-timers only as a project that I

00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:49,540
started with Shana or Scott Hanselman

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:51,910
and I always I always think his name is

00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,400
Shawn because his Twitter is s Hanselman

00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:57,340
and that looks like Shawn and some in

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,290
right like sha and so I always say his

00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,910
name is Shawn but it's Scott um but yeah

00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,220
so Scott and I started this first time

00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,740
there's only thing where you curate an

00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:09,820
issue that it's like dead simple and you

00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:12,400
give very specific steps like you you

00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:14,140
even give them code to copy/paste most

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,510
of the time these are like one-line

00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,920
changes where you have a you know a bang

00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,970
equals equals when it should just be a

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,640
triple equals there's something like

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:26,320
it's just a silly easy thing to fix and

00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,710
and you you kind of guide them in that

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,840
way it's super rewarding to do this it

00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,850
takes a silly amount of time compared to

00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,830
just doing it yourself fixing the bug or

00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:38,170
whatever but it is outrageously

00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,990
rewarding I strongly advise you just try

00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,970
it once it is a very fun experience for

00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,190
you and the person who's contributing

00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,500
for the first time so just making really

00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,380
easy issues for people to contribute to

00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,540
and hand-holding them through that

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,240
process for the first time it's very

00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,760
cool another project that I'm involved

00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,460
in is all contributors really quick how

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,210
many of you are have used all

00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:06,430
contributors before yeah if you have I

00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,980
do have a very limited amount of

00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:10,900
stickers of all contributors but

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,460
basically the idea of all contributors I

00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,470
would show you except I'm having trouble

00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,990
connecting to the internet so you just

00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,910
have to imagine in your mind but all

00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,860
contributors is basically a table that

00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,140
goes in at the bottom if you read me or

00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,190
it could go into another file of

00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:27,310
everybody who's contributed to your

00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:29,290
project and the idea is that yes we have

00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:31,030
the github graph that I'll show you all

00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,620
the people who have committed to your

00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:34,420
project but those are not all of the

00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,400
contributors of your project there are

00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,990
people answering questions reviewing PRS

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,820
and writing blog posts and to tour

00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:43,369
and all of these different things that

00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,599
are absolutely contributors to your

00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:47,420
project and they're not really getting

00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:52,520
any recognition as far as the you know

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:55,130
github stats show and so by using this

00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,440
table you can express your gratitude in

00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:59,990
a way that is really real and human and

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,599
I it's been a really rewarding thing for

00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:03,980
me and the all countries has a bot so

00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:06,920
it's just really easy to get people

00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,630
added on to that table so I really

00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,670
recommend you look into this people

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,710
there's actually a research done on

00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,630
Wikipedia like how do we get people to

00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,880
continue to contribute after they've

00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:19,310
done it the first time and they found

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,200
that when they give people special

00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:23,560
recognition for contributing they will

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,230
continue to contribute thereafter so

00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,150
check out all contributors so just a

00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:31,280
last couple of things having a

00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,660
maintaining markdown file or some

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,940
maintaining documentation that explains

00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,530
how you maintain the project's like how

00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:40,220
to releases work how do all you do all

00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:42,170
these things is a really good idea it's

00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,790
even for you if you forget like you move

00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,619
to a new computer now oh shoot how do I

00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,869
set up my environment whatever it is so

00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:51,980
having a maintaining a project there too

00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:53,560
so just to review the last few things so

00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,880
you need a license code of conduct

00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,220
having a road map is helpful on defining

00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,619
your extensibility automation saves you

00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,970
silly amount of time even though it

00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:03,560
seems like it'll take you longer to

00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,330
automate it once you have it automated

00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,609
just saves you so much time especially

00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:09,320
with more projects take your community

00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:11,180
seriously you can community building

00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,980
your community turns into your

00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,950
contributors so treat them really well

00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,780
and that's all that I have for you

00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:21,500
just a couple resources here you can

00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:22,880
check those out and yeah thank you very

00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:30,010
much

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:30,010
