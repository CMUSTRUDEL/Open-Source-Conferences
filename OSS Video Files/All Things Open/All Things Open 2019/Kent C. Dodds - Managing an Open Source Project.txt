Description: 
	Awesome! Youâ€™ve made it big! Youâ€™ve published an open source project and people are actually using it to make the world a better place. Achievement unlocked! Great job! But waitâ€¦ whatâ€™s this? An issue? Oh, itâ€™s just a bug. Pretty quick and easy. Fixed, released, done, #likeaboss ðŸ˜Ž. Whatâ€™s this? A PR? How cool! Waitâ€¦ Thatâ€™s not quite rightâ€¦ Oh, a question! Cool! And another! And anotherâ€¦ ehâ€¦ and anotherâ€¦ Uh ohâ€¦ You think youâ€™ve just sold your soul to this project. You start an open source project to scratch your own itch and suddenly other people start using it and they need your help. This can easily start eating up your time big time and before you know it, your kids/dogs start feeling neglected. Iâ€™ve had to deal with this in a few projects and Iâ€™ve learned a thing or two about work/life/oss balance. I have a few tricks that help you make the project manage itself a bit more while still being friendly and helpful to users of the project. Letâ€™s chat.
