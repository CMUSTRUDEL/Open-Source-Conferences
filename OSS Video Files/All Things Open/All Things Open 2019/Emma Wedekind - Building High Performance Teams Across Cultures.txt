Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Have you ever worked with team members from other parts of the world? If so, have you ever experienced misunderstandings or had trouble communicating? Thatâ€™s because each culture communicates differently and by learning to recognize these differences we can enhance our collaboration and build high-performing teams. In this talk weâ€™ll delve into methods for collaborating across cultures and giving and receiving feedback so you can enhance your team cadence.

include a operation to make sure to work

00:02:48,120 --> 00:03:05,150
on origin surplus we are your model

00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:14,340
system base to base their smoking or not

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:20,370
or and we covered so so resource and but

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:24,720
the series will be a multi because I'm

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:36,640
excuse me has rated on the ocean was

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:39,700
introduced today is server solution

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,469
posted about each person's this to

00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,299
people and all the supporting strengthen

00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:02,459
ISM in the geography we shouldn't route

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,040
every initial from the scene which is

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,530
happiness in hairdressing it would be a

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,859
little bit rainy to really deserve our

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,599
cultural center because we don't

00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:15,599
these are impactful chair out the way

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:30,720
leading people who need we saw through

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:32,370
everything else the culture that were

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,910
raised in early talks the way the

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:41,070
library and understand services can help

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:43,500
us as American anything but what

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,990
introducing students I think what's

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,000
really extension stresses are costs

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,250
nearly instantly to be sure that

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,770
presumption page and this is what we

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,990
call the context be patient where has a

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,659
different stress through the communities

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:02,880
that way but now focus to these

00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:08,250
characteristic communication but it's

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:15,080
really a simple job you are concise

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:19,169
answers to lots of weird mystery here

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:24,750
localization or your assets are by

00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:26,940
monasticism stay on the culture not the

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,860
Western cultures along the English since

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:41,520
they are the less I think it's low

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:43,889
context less impact on their education

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,639
experience

00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:49,919
spells general so as an example area and

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,469
we pay our dues and we content topics

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,930
that we can communicate also right side

00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:58,379
everything laughs as a result as

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,569
American we kind receive became evil

00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:04,999
predict western Syria and parted

00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:08,340
understand so it's all about up sweet

00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:10,710
so what use every communication is not

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,319
necessarily one of their ocean series in

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,389
Asia someone from a local context

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,819
culture evaluates living Univision

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,949
remote rural in written validation and

00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,469
be who seem coming from a high religious

00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,300
culture to be about community here this

00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:28,080
is the communication styles just listen

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,400
to her in fact the u.s. the lowest

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,800
context under the world

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,919
the English ask people for salsa luck

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,139
consignment sale you questions be wrong

00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,819
someone is looking magnification in

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:43,740
Europe really see France as well as some

00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:46,740
Americans offense to the result both in

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,479
volantis and then the operation which is

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,860
false right and meeting the highest

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,770
priced alternative world was completely

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,339
stated that was variation completely

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:01,620
trained staff to extreme culture

00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:04,139
soldiers trying to be a to move along

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,180
share industry and the focus more in

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:09,120
relationship or aging societies or

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,699
tradition their house on generations the

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,060
contrast marry community leaders hold

00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,860
and it's really impacted by all students

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,550
are immigrants from all over the world

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:23,599
also even Atlantis so effectively the

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,339
language barriers we need to think about

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,800
suitable the narrator of fifty years

00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,259
right there's a lot of something often

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,060
understanding issue versus look actually

00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:37,440
one speech at work

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:40,230
I understand buddy so they're from a low

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,470
context culture in every casino Atlantis

00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:47,820
culture might receive MC vacuum here I

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:52,440
buy expenses or not my census but if

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,580
your virmire I'm sorry but can you

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,700
receive your genes

00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:12,350
that's pretty vital resources to Thomas

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:15,090
and these philosophers a zoonotic

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:17,520
without reminded of my journey as I said

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,680
female soldier Lockhart saying hey at

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,770
least when she decides to want my effort

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,610
than positive it was not and you find

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:29,490
immediate responses like many occasions

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:33,000
like eating a unitary operator now I

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,909
think it might know it and they haven't

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,810
made the service long stairs to my a

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,380
missionary

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:43,140
we must translate the answer a way of

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,650
spinning the same harvester all these I

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,560
know but that's not exactly the way they

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,110
process information because not all of

00:08:49,560 --> 00:09:02,730
this beauty in the same way we do

00:08:52,110 --> 00:09:04,200
so how can we dream I'm working people

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,839
from higher context culture social

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,180
awareness is a communication on

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,610
Ostrovsky deep thoughts about this thing

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,740
so listen about the triangle scene said

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,670
rather than learn from us and actually

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:22,830
this and interacting will see the fire

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:25,370
consumed members in fact that he managed

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:30,240
to tear custard some job

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:34,230
please try recognizing probably being a

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,210
wave of service when Worthen people who

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,870
love our context cultures support a

00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:44,310
solicitation clearly for Karen underdone

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:48,570
if not meaning the hottest topics in the

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,920
probably outlining to success more than

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,150
emotional Chelsea

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,920
I thought smooth vision eye contacts

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,460
maybe she wants to leave obviously

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,680
members of the same culture experience

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:04,880
but it needs for a calm way due to cold

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:10,350
shooting my high context cultures like

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:13,350
Rizzoli was the planner so about so he's

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,530
full of miracles to each of us

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,840
Louisa Mary appears 81 personally she

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:25,910
move together they're going to eat

00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:29,820
without me actually for them so

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:34,050
universities riders so to Malthus we

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:37,160
need recipes for multihull disease make

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,160
sure everyone's eh

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:45,180
so moving into made components so we get

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,710
you to imprison them this is to start

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,710
measuring the response cultures and

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,570
understanding one of the strategies to

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,550
teach posture alternate rapidly improve

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:58,470
your English do that so there's two

00:10:53,550 --> 00:11:00,420
magnets that form a dependency that the

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,670
first straps are going to back so we

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,760
learn today that centers if he backs

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:09,330
right at least ie is one honest and we

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,160
must seize yourself and when they're

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,320
swimming feedback from someone there

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,090
were drugs we got sure you notice these

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,090
a lot of forwards that

00:11:18,320 --> 00:12:44,790
absolutely interesting the attack dress

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:47,220
and team so is another term inclusion on

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,050
philosophers long to investing so a

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,570
lovely ones are going to be back late

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,810
journey when it's another nice property

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,640
to interview really gonna be back at the

00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:04,080
company and they seem that they need not

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:05,910
be duties because I marinated Americans

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,550
elation that they're going to be back

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,550
away like a positive sandwich

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,110
interaction that alters like angry

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:24,900
instantly and the capacity all turn into

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,640
a watery collision maybe you should have

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,420
you strapped so versatility for

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,430
quantitatively cultures are a little

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,740
context and provide traction in fact

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,250
that thirty number may if you want a

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,440
significant improvement but dizziness

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,560
and I'm so straight forward Adolf to eat

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,630
over there kind of say what's really

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,790
where is it evenly values on the street

00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,040
experiencing don't try to get action

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,610
because a lot of a series see them you

00:13:50,040 --> 00:14:00,240
know over the line which we proved and

00:13:52,610 --> 00:14:03,120
so I don't really bad fight directly to

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,580
do that there and see Russia see little

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,920
orange peels language it's quite

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,920
indirectly contract anything that

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,800
something is while they're clustering

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,520
the air their religious record of their

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,709
key back poachers are little context

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:24,510
right and ready to be that the u.s.

00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:31,500
didn't okay I'm straight down two

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:33,180
different surfaces by us and they start

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,650
off with a few pauses like this is great

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:40,020
love it you know the day and they act in

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,390
their closet great this week you throw

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,550
the cultures and there is only their

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,070
provider everything has sense amazing

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:50,070
and people from abroad on 1300 I

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,050
actually for everything I ever heard

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,110
stuff like something us heard even I

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:59,580
build speed here today very beautiful

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:08,550
you see she don't get outside scene

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:10,560
me suspense music Realtors interrupts

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,870
tuning in doctors like your village

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,540
energy and don't you think

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,570
busted them group everything's part

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,400
sorry

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:26,510
energy boost variety Baskerville who

00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,980
closes the person maybe that's the lead

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:32,839
over here in time

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:35,089
Thailand is planning a little shamey

00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,630
table so suppose for Japanese call these

00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:41,360
misleading presentation trip and this

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,339
looks like a really great the last tired

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,610
every sloppy looking probably something

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,210
today

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,310
like just so famous more but at least

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:52,850
book as you jump interaction feedback

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:55,910
what she meant and it only sees in the

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,310
cousin so you Tom okay I love the first

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:01,670
a few slides about your grief and you

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,710
