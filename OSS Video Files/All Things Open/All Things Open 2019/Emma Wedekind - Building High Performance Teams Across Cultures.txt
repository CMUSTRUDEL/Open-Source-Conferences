Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Have you ever worked with team members from other parts of the world? If so, have you ever experienced misunderstandings or had trouble communicating? That’s because each culture communicates differently and by learning to recognize these differences we can enhance our collaboration and build high-performing teams. In this talk we’ll delve into methods for collaborating across cultures and giving and receiving feedback so you can enhance your team cadence.

include a operation to make sure to work

00:02:48,120 --> 00:03:05,150
on origin surplus we are your model

00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:14,340
system base to base their smoking or not

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:20,370
or and we covered so so resource and but

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:24,720
the series will be a multi because I'm

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:36,640
excuse me has rated on the ocean was

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:39,700
introduced today is server solution

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,469
posted about each person's this to

00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,299
people and all the supporting strengthen

00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:02,459
ISM in the geography we shouldn't route

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,040
every initial from the scene which is

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,530
happiness in hairdressing it would be a

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,859
little bit rainy to really deserve our

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,599
cultural center because we don't

00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:15,599
these are impactful chair out the way

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:30,720
leading people who need we saw through

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:32,370
everything else the culture that were

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,910
raised in early talks the way the

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:41,070
library and understand services can help

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:43,500
us as American anything but what

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,990
introducing students I think what's

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,000
really extension stresses are costs

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,250
nearly instantly to be sure that

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,770
presumption page and this is what we

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,990
call the context be patient where has a

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,659
different stress through the communities

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:02,880
that way but now focus to these

00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:08,250
characteristic communication but it's

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:15,080
really a simple job you are concise

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:19,169
answers to lots of weird mystery here

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:24,750
localization or your assets are by

00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:26,940
monasticism stay on the culture not the

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,860
Western cultures along the English since

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:41,520
they are the less I think it's low

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:43,889
context less impact on their education

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,639
experience

00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:49,919
spells general so as an example area and

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,469
we pay our dues and we content topics

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,930
that we can communicate also right side

00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:58,379
everything laughs as a result as

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,569
American we kind receive became evil

00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:04,999
predict western Syria and parted

00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:08,340
understand so it's all about up sweet

00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:10,710
so what use every communication is not

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,319
necessarily one of their ocean series in

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,389
Asia someone from a local context

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,819
culture evaluates living Univision

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,949
remote rural in written validation and

00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,469
be who seem coming from a high religious

00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,300
culture to be about community here this

00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:28,080
is the communication styles just listen

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,400
to her in fact the u.s. the lowest

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,800
context under the world

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,919
the English ask people for salsa luck

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,139
consignment sale you questions be wrong

00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,819
someone is looking magnification in

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:43,740
Europe really see France as well as some

00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:46,740
Americans offense to the result both in

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,479
volantis and then the operation which is

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,860
false right and meeting the highest

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,770
priced alternative world was completely

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,339
stated that was variation completely

00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:01,620
trained staff to extreme culture

00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:04,139
soldiers trying to be a to move along

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,180
share industry and the focus more in

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:09,120
relationship or aging societies or

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,699
tradition their house on generations the

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,060
contrast marry community leaders hold

00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,860
and it's really impacted by all students

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,550
are immigrants from all over the world

00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:23,599
also even Atlantis so effectively the

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,339
language barriers we need to think about

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,800
suitable the narrator of fifty years

00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,259
right there's a lot of something often

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,060
understanding issue versus look actually

00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:37,440
one speech at work

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:40,230
I understand buddy so they're from a low

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,470
context culture in every casino Atlantis

00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:47,820
culture might receive MC vacuum here I

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:52,440
buy expenses or not my census but if

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,580
your virmire I'm sorry but can you

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,700
receive your genes

00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:12,350
that's pretty vital resources to Thomas

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:15,090
and these philosophers a zoonotic

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:17,520
without reminded of my journey as I said

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,680
female soldier Lockhart saying hey at

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,770
least when she decides to want my effort

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,610
than positive it was not and you find

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:29,490
immediate responses like many occasions

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:33,000
like eating a unitary operator now I

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,909
think it might know it and they haven't

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,810
made the service long stairs to my a

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,380
missionary

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:43,140
we must translate the answer a way of

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,650
spinning the same harvester all these I

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,560
know but that's not exactly the way they

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,110
process information because not all of

00:08:49,560 --> 00:09:02,730
this beauty in the same way we do

00:08:52,110 --> 00:09:04,200
so how can we dream I'm working people

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,839
from higher context culture social

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,180
awareness is a communication on

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,610
Ostrovsky deep thoughts about this thing

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,740
so listen about the triangle scene said

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,670
rather than learn from us and actually

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:22,830
this and interacting will see the fire

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:25,370
consumed members in fact that he managed

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:30,240
to tear custard some job

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:34,230
please try recognizing probably being a

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,210
wave of service when Worthen people who

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,870
love our context cultures support a

00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:44,310
solicitation clearly for Karen underdone

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:48,570
if not meaning the hottest topics in the

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,920
probably outlining to success more than

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,150
emotional Chelsea

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,920
I thought smooth vision eye contacts

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,460
maybe she wants to leave obviously

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,680
members of the same culture experience

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:04,880
but it needs for a calm way due to cold

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:10,350
shooting my high context cultures like

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:13,350
Rizzoli was the planner so about so he's

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,530
full of miracles to each of us

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,840
Louisa Mary appears 81 personally she

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:25,910
move together they're going to eat

00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:29,820
without me actually for them so

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:34,050
universities riders so to Malthus we

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:37,160
need recipes for multihull disease make

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,160
sure everyone's eh

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:45,180
so moving into made components so we get

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,710
you to imprison them this is to start

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,710
measuring the response cultures and

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,570
understanding one of the strategies to

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,550
teach posture alternate rapidly improve

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:58,470
your English do that so there's two

00:10:53,550 --> 00:11:00,420
magnets that form a dependency that the

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,670
first straps are going to back so we

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,760
learn today that centers if he backs

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:09,330
right at least ie is one honest and we

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,160
must seize yourself and when they're

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,320
swimming feedback from someone there

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,090
were drugs we got sure you notice these

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,090
a lot of forwards that

00:11:18,320 --> 00:12:44,790
absolutely interesting the attack dress

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:47,220
and team so is another term inclusion on

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,050
philosophers long to investing so a

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,570
lovely ones are going to be back late

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,810
journey when it's another nice property

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,640
to interview really gonna be back at the

00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:04,080
company and they seem that they need not

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:05,910
be duties because I marinated Americans

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,550
elation that they're going to be back

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,550
away like a positive sandwich

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,110
interaction that alters like angry

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:24,900
instantly and the capacity all turn into

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,640
a watery collision maybe you should have

00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,420
you strapped so versatility for

00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,430
quantitatively cultures are a little

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,740
context and provide traction in fact

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,250
that thirty number may if you want a

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,440
significant improvement but dizziness

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,560
and I'm so straight forward Adolf to eat

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,630
over there kind of say what's really

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,790
where is it evenly values on the street

00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,040
experiencing don't try to get action

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,610
because a lot of a series see them you

00:13:50,040 --> 00:14:00,240
know over the line which we proved and

00:13:52,610 --> 00:14:03,120
so I don't really bad fight directly to

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,580
do that there and see Russia see little

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,920
orange peels language it's quite

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,920
indirectly contract anything that

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,800
something is while they're clustering

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,520
the air their religious record of their

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,709
key back poachers are little context

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:24,510
right and ready to be that the u.s.

00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:31,500
didn't okay I'm straight down two

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:33,180
different surfaces by us and they start

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,650
off with a few pauses like this is great

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:40,020
love it you know the day and they act in

00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,390
their closet great this week you throw

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,550
the cultures and there is only their

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,070
provider everything has sense amazing

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:50,070
and people from abroad on 1300 I

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,050
actually for everything I ever heard

00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,110
stuff like something us heard even I

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:59,580
build speed here today very beautiful

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:08,550
you see she don't get outside scene

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:10,560
me suspense music Realtors interrupts

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,870
tuning in doctors like your village

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:17,540
energy and don't you think

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,570
busted them group everything's part

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,400
sorry

00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:26,510
energy boost variety Baskerville who

00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,980
closes the person maybe that's the lead

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:32,839
over here in time

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:35,089
Thailand is planning a little shamey

00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:38,630
table so suppose for Japanese call these

00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:41,360
misleading presentation trip and this

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,339
looks like a really great the last tired

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,610
every sloppy looking probably something

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,210
today

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,310
like just so famous more but at least

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:52,850
book as you jump interaction feedback

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:55,910
what she meant and it only sees in the

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,310
cousin so you Tom okay I love the first

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:01,670
a few slides about your grief and you

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,710
