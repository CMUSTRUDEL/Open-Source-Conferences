Title: Saron Yitbarek - The Magical Living Room
Publication date: 2019-11-04
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	It’s easier than ever to learn to code. Everyone – from engineers to entrepreneurs – has access now more than ever to free and and cheap books, courses, websites to level up; no matter who you are or where you come from, you too, can learn to code. But learning to code and becoming a developer isn’t simply about the existence of resources- it’s about the community that comes with it.

In her talk,Saron explores what it takes to build a truly inclusive and accessible developer community from lessons she learned from her mom growing up.

[Music]

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:14,460

today we're going to talk about the

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,369
magical living room how to build

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,380
authentic and engaged communities so a

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,820
little bit about me I am CEO and founder

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,769
of code newbie we have the most

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,599
supportive community of programmers and

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,699
people who are learning to code I also

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,690
host this awesome podcast called the

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,670
command line heroes it's a pot year

00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:38,309
ago.the podcast by red hat it's awesome

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,860
we get to explore all kinds of histories

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,050
and stories about people who do open

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,059
source so it's wonderful and I'm also

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,670
actually working on a new podcast with

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,860
IBM called code cafe so make sure to

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,800
check out look out for that later this

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,480
year or early next year so back to our

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,910
topic the magical living room how to

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,309
build authentic and engaged communities

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,680
so we're gonna start with that last word

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,539
communities and what that word means

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,519
so for me when I think about communities

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,740
the first community that I was ever a

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,460
part of was the Ethiopian immigrant

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,409
community

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,799
so I'm Ethiopian I was born in Ethiopia

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,180
when I was 1 years old my father came to

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,369
the United States and then when I was

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,799
almost 3 my mom and I followed him and

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,479
so we grew up in the United States were

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,030
very much in touch with our Ethiopian

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,580
roots and we moved to DC which has a

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,409
huge Ethiopian immigrant population and

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,900
if you think about any immigrant

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,729
population you might recognize that it

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,250
is a more vulnerable one these are

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,350
people who traveled many many miles from

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,390
a country that they're very familiar

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,100
with that they grew up in to a place

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,110
where they don't know anyone they don't

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,060
know the customs they don't know the

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,710
process they don't know sometimes even

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,020
the language and so that's a really

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,579
really huge transition for them and a

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,530
lot of times they don't necessarily feel

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,810
welcome they don't feel safe they don't

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,850
really feel wanted and so for our

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,159
community it seemed that there was one

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,380
place that we always knew we were safe

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,649
and welcomed and wanted and that was in

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,600
my mom's living room my mom was a

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,310
community builder and this is something

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,929
that I really took for granted growing

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,970
up I didn't appreciate that she was such

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,560
a community builder because it made

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,140
sense that people wanted to hang out

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,180
thus we had a nice living room my mom is

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,010
a very nice woman she cooks very good

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,560
food so why wouldn't you want to hang

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,750
out with us but if I really think about

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,610
it there are other people who had bigger

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,350
living rooms there are other people who

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,290
had nice moms who could also cook well

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,690
so what was so special about our living

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,840
room what made our living room so

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,940
magical there are a few things that my

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,310
mom did to really create that magical

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,140
living room environment the first is

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,750
that she was the first to serve and the

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,970
last to eat she was the host of the

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,410
party the host of the gathering and so

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,480
she would wait and make sure that

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,550
everyone had their plate even had their

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,380
second or third plate and only once

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,780
everyone was sitting and eating and

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,810
laughing and having a good time was she

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,940
able to then go and feed herself the

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,130
second thing that she did was she led by

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,350
observing she would sit in the back and

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,269
she'd watch over everyone and make sure

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,459
that everyone was happy and she might

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,300
notice that hey you didn't touch that

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,489
one dish

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,830
why didn't you touch that one dish and

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,120
you go oh well it was too spicy it was

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,370
just too much I couldn't really handle

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,320
it and she'd make a note of that and the

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,299
next time you came to visit she would

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,670
have a non spicy version of that same

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,290
dish just for you and it was a really

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,150
small thing to do she cooked another

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,250
dish doesn't seem like a big deal but

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,870
for you and meant a lot and made you

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,989
feel like you mattered that your

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,970
opinions were important the last thing

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,190
she did was she would solve many

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,530
problems but they were many little

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,390
problems one example that stands out to

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,910
me the most is on Thanksgiving this is a

00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,530
couple years ago and for Ethiopians we

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,239
don't really do Thanksgiving it's not

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,380
our holiday it's an American thing but

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,180
because we're in America we celebrate

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,900
Thanksgiving we have you know the big

00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,989
dinner and one Thanksgiving we forgot to

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,180
buy the gravy I know it's a terrible

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,410
thing and so we forgot to buy the grave

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,579
and we thought what are we gonna do we

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,410
can't have turkey and mashed potatoes

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,390
without having the gravy what are we

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,950
going to do and I'm thinking oh man the

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,390
grocery store is closed we have to go to

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,540
the gas station we're gonna get gas

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,579
station gravy what is gonna happen and

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,470
my mom said don't worry I'm gonna figure

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,590
this out and she goes into the kitchen

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,970
she gets some flowers and spices some

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,700
turkey juice is that what you call it

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:30,090
and she whips together the most amazing

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,130
greevey you've ever had now this may not

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,020
seem a big deal to you if you're born

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,700
raised in America and you celebrate

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,220
Thanksgiving as a family and lifelong

00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,560
family tradition but for us we don't eat

00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,420
gravy we don't even really have Turkey

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,790
in Ethiopia so the fact that this little

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,590
immigrant woman just figured out how to

00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,420
make gravy while everyone was standing

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,120
around in the kitchen watching her do it

00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,520
was amazing to me but that's what she

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,100
did she saw these little problems always

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,710
solving these little problems now if you

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,370
think about these steps and you abstract

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,530
them you'll come up with this this loop

00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,570
that goes understanding building

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,310
learning iterating and these steps

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,740
hopefully look familiar to you as

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,600
developers as technologists these are

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,080
the steps we use when we build products

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,230
we understand who our users are we build

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,960
for them we learn from them and then we

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,640
iterate and we make it even better this

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,610
is a product development loop that also

00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,140
applies to community building and if you

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,090
think about the examples I shared with

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,030
you none of them were particularly huge

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,130
all than work frankly food-related but

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,230
even in these little examples she showed

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,090
you that she cared about you that you

00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,300
were safe you were welcome and you were

00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,480
wanted so fast forward many years later

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,800
I am now an adult and I decide that I

00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,060
want to get into cult that's what I look

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,580
like when I decide I want to get into go

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,620
it's very scruffy and so I decided that

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,420
I wanted to get into coding and so I

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,220
decided to teach myself for a couple

00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,770
months then I was enrolled in a program

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,740
called the Flatiron school and when I

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,210
graduated I felt so good I felt so

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,310
powerful I jumped up clicked my heels

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,170
and how about a keyboard and I said to

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,870
myself I know everything about color

00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:12,540
coding is great now I get to finally be

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:15,810
a developer but the process of becoming

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,230
a developer for me cost eleven thousand

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,670
dollars and many months without a salary

00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,620
now fortunately I could afford to do

00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:24,750
that but that's a lot of money in a lot

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,390
of time for folks who are less fortunate

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,580
folks who might be struggling and so

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,130
when I thought about the real value of

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,900
that eleven thousand dollars it wasn't

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,870
just the curriculum and the coding it

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,840
was really the community so here's what

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,690
I knew I knew that community was keen

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,780
to that coding journey but it was also

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:48,300
incredibly inaccessible to most people

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,010
so I decided that I was going to do

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,410
something about it I was going to build

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,430
the code would be Twitter chat so show

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,139
of hands if you know what a Twitter chat

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,060
is show of hands show of hands okay okay

00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,889
that's pretty good so a Twitter chat is

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,230
when you use a hashtag so for us it was

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,360
code newbie and you join at a particular

00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,980
hour some time of the week so for us it

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,070
was Wednesday night to 9 p.m. Eastern

00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:10,320
Time and we would pick a topic so it

00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,090
might be for example debugging and then

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,010
we would talk about that for an hour and

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,660
it would be us from the code newbie

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,790
account moderating giving out the

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,250
questions and then anyone using the

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,139
hashtag to participate to join in to

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,360
share information to share stories and

00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,220
it became a really really great tool for

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,260
the community but when you're putting

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,810
together a Twitter chat how do you make

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,389
a magical Twitter chat how do you do one

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,760
specifically for the newbie community

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,590
for people who are just getting started

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,720
for us we started with some rules and

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,450
three rules that we began every single

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,130
chat with you had to be nice he had to

00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:47,460
be supportive and you had to be helpful

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,289
and those were the three rules and we

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,520
started every single Twitter chat with

00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:52,860
these three rules and it did a couple

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,380
things number one it set the tone so you

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,970
knew right when you walked in that this

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,600
was a place where we did not tolerate

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:02,700
meanness we only expected the you to be

00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,380
on your best behavior there did

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,479
something else that also signal to

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,669
people that hey this is a safe space for

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,860
you if you're out in the world and

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,090
you're worried about being trolled if

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,340
you're worried about people looking down

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,270
on you because you're new if you feel

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,400
self-conscious

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,250
we're signalling to you that that won't

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,280
happen here that this is a safe space

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:28,350
for you the other thing we did is we

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,300
were aggressively disgustingly nice now

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,909
for this what I mean is when people

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,640
would Twitter us and say hey I got my

00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:38,760
first job we would tweet them so many

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,680
huggy smiley faces and when they said

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,760
hey I just interviewed and I'm really

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,260
nervous about it but I think you won

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,410
okay I'm not sure how it went we would

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,600
give them so many heart emojis and when

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,980
they said you know I first I did my

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,900
first poll request for an open-source

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,990
project they would get so many

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,480
exclamation points filled with

00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,089
that's what we did we were aggressively

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,760
disgustingly nice because frankly that's

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:05,670
what our community needs they need that

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,860
they need to feel overly loved they need

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:12,630
that huge joy they needed cheerleaders

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,850
in their lives so this happened for I

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,950
think about a year and things were going

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,230
great people loved the Twitter chat they

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,120
were really into the conversation the

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,860
quality of the discussion but they were

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,690
also excited about all the people they

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,390
were meeting they got to connect with

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,890
potential employers they got to connect

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,600
with mentors they got to connect with

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,890
people who just wanted to help who were

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,440
going through the same struggles they

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,300
were and so once this chat started

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,209
picking up though I started to get

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,970
messages from people who said hey I love

00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:44,579
what you're doing but I can't

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,930
participate because I'm asleep when

00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:47,370
you're doing your chat on Wednesdays at

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,440
9:00 p.m. it's 3 o'clock in the morning

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,029
for me or at 7 o'clock in the morning

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,769
I'm taking my kids to school

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:55,589
I can't participate it I wish there was

00:09:52,769 --> 00:10:00,269
a way for me to join in so I learned

00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:02,279
about time zones and I learned like most

00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:04,160
of her helpers to that time zones are a

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,779
problem whether you're coding or not and

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,250
so I said to myself okay we need to do

00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,980
something to solve this time zone

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,680
problem so we iterated and we created a

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,390
second morning chat so this happened

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,519
11:00 a.m. Pacific time 2:00 p.m.

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,050
Eastern Time and it was on Sunday so we

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,660
picked a weekend this time to make it

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,880
more accessible and we had a coding

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,070
check in so this was kind of like an

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,930
accountability system every Sunday you

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,130
would say what you were working on that

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,800
week and when you had done the previous

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,209
week and it was a small little way of

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,860
making sure that you were holding

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:36,720
yourself accountable and people would

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,730
share their goals and share their

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,130
accomplishments there was this wonderful

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,649
30 minute chat that can help you get

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,560
started on your next week so here's the

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:50,010
thing if those people who messaged me

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,760
hadn't spoken up we would not have the

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:57,079
Sunday morning chats that idea did not

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,370
come from me it came from the community

00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,440
so code newbies going well everything's

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,540
going great but what I learned from

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,940
doing these Twitter chats is that

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,170
Twitter chats are a really great way to

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,120
have a lot

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,450
conversations multiple threads in one go

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,450
but it's not a great way to dig deep to

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,850
dive into a particular topic or to hear

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,790
a particular story it gets to have it

00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,620
too noisy now I wanted to find out

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,810
what's a better medium for doing that

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,910
and my first job out of college was

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,610
actually working at NPR and so I thought

00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:32,670
audio storytelling via audio podcasting

00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,829
is a really great tool for that now when

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,709
I looked at the landscape for technical

00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:39,899
podcasts I saw that there's lots of

00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:42,510
technical content but there weren't a

00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,920
lot of technical stories if I wanted to

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,839
learn about new Jes there was probably a

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,670
podcast multiple podcasts on view Jes

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,410
but if I wanted to hear from the creator

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,060
of UJS and how it came to be and a

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:54,000
little bit more about the industry that

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,430
was a lot harder to find so I wanted to

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,649
find these technical stories and I

00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,540
wanted to highlight the journey of being

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:04,709
a developer and not just the code itself

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,209
so I built the code newbie podcast but

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:07,860
if you're targeting a community of

00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:10,139
people who are just getting started and

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,050
they are unfamiliar with tech you're

00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:16,709
trying to ramp them up how do you create

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,630
a magical podcast there are a couple

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:22,140
things that this community really needs

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:25,170
the first is they need validation that

00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,320
they belong in tech there tends to be

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,670
two dominant narratives the first is

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,899
that you were kind of born with the

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,820
computer you had a computers did you or

00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,050
two you had your first open-source

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,490
project when you were 12

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,709
you just been going hard you're like you

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,390
know king queen of Stack Overflow you

00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:42,000
got all the points and that's kind of

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:45,089
who you are but the second narrative are

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,070
folks who got a computer science degree

00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,079
in undergrad and who intern at the top

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,060
tech companies and now are working for a

00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,720
Google or maybe a Red Hat and we're

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,610
working at these top tech firms so what

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,410
about everyone else cuz there are many

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,750
other ways of getting into tech that you

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,089
just don't hear about so we wanted to

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,470
highlight those stories this is a little

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:06,630
snapshot of all the different people

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,399
we've had on the show and as you can

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,589
tell we not only are incredibly diverse

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,940
and inclusive in demographic ways we

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,860
have people from all different genders

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,930
and backgrounds and different geographic

00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,149
locations and all that but we also have

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,350
people who got into tech many different

00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:22,480
ways people who used to be

00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,490
janitors babysitters journalists who

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,960
learned how to code people who got into

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,670
it from being a designer for many years

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,020
who who got into it from being in tech

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,240
marketing and then transitioned into

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,280
code people who got into it in many many

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,880
different ways we highlighted those

00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:40,240
stories the second thing is that our

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,700
community needs validation that they can

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,290
do this there's this huge level of

00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,420
insecurity that happens when you're

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,160
first starting to learn to code it can

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,440
be incredibly incredibly intimidating

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,450
and it gets better I think as you become

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,280
more technical but it's still there this

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,130
question of do I belong and can I really

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,730
do this but this is particularly loud

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:01,630
and noisy when you're first starting out

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,740
so there are many ways that you can

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,950
address this but the way that I

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,840
addressed it in the podcast is that I

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:11,230
would ask questions in a very particular

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:14,500
way the way I approach hosting when I'm

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,590
doing interviews is I try and channel my

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,870
audience I try and put my audience hat

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,610
on and I say okay if I'm listening in my

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,880
car on my way to work on the way to

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,140
school what do I want to know what are

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,750
the gaps for me what am I most

00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,150
interested in and the same question

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,190
applies when the guest says something

00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,570
that might be too technical that might

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,630
be something that's hard for people to

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,610
understand so for example a guest might

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,770
casually talk about TDD test-driven

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,240
development and they might casually go

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,610
about it fit it into you know a long

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,040
paragraph of things and it's my job to

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,990
go wait a minute what is TDD now there's

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,050
a couple ways you can ask that question

00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,240
you can say hey for people who don't

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,880
know what is TDD and that's a perfectly

00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,040
fair way of asking that question but

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,820
what I try to do is I try to go hey can

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,800
you tell me what TD is even if it's

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,200
something I'm unfamiliar with even if

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,110
it's something that I already know I

00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,900
know that my guests my audience probably

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:17,560
doesn't know that thing and so I ask for

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,450
my audience I take on that role and so

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,820
when I do that I'm doing something very

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,380
very subtle when you say oh that really

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,680
quiet thank you person to close the door

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,960
appreciate you so when you say to

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,190
someone hey can you explain what UD is

00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,230
for people who don't know what you're

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:36,650
really saying is you know what you do

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:39,110
I know what he did he is the people who

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,170
are listening should know what TDD is

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,540
but they don't so can we help them out

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,630
but instead when you say can you tell me

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,000
what TDD is you're making it okay you're

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:53,540
validating this idea that that might be

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,250
a new concept a new term for people the

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,410
last thing that I do that I really try

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,530
and focus on is I try to get out of the

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:04,190
way I am the least important person on

00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:06,470
my podcast I do not matter my job is to

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,230
guide the conversation to bring out the

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,730
best in our podcast guests but it's not

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,770
really about me and I'm gonna prove that

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,480
to you if you look here this is an

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,760
interview we did the Chad Fowler Season

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,070
5 episode 8 and if you look at that top

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,710
track that's me and if you look at the

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:25,400
body track that's Chad Chad likes to

00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:27,440
talk and if you look at that top track

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,170
it's not even really me asking questions

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,280
a lot of those audio ways or me going

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:36,230
mm-hm

00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,550
and and if you ever want to be a podcast

00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,120
host that's really all you need to do

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,070
just go mm hmm mm and you're good to go

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,410
I'm gonna do another example this is

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,540
Scott handsome in episode 17 same thing

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:51,770
Scott's on the bottom I'm on the top

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,050
Scott talks more than chat same deal me

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:55,820
gone mm-hmm and me guiding the

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,410
conversation but really it's all about

00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,570
Scott it's about giving him an

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,360
opportunity to shine and an opportunity

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,730
for our audience to learn from him so

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,470
the car the podcast is going great

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,090
people are loving it they're saying that

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,590
they're learning so much they're feeling

00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,780
really validated they feel like their

00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:14,860
own journeys are being highlighted and

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:18,170
things are going wonderfully and then

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:20,690
this happened we launched a new show

00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,910
called the base yes podcast and this one

00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,850
was all about teaching computer science

00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:28,340
topics in short 20 minute episodes and

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,800
in the show it's myself and my co-host

00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:33,590
fight he Joshi and she wrote this very

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,600
popular blog series called base yes and

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,370
what she did is she does not have a

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,080
computer science background and she

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,200
decided that she wanted to teach herself

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,020
computer science and so every week for

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,019
one year she learned a new computer

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,330
science

00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:50,279
she taught herself and then she wrote

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:52,409
about it and I remember when she first

00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,000
started me thinking that's a big project

00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:55,559
we'll see if you finish it

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,210
but then she did finish it and I said

00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,429
holy crap this is amazing what an

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,440
incredible resource for people who are

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:03,539
also learning and wanting to learn

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,009
computer science and so I reached out to

00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:08,190
her and I said can we turn this into a

00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:09,269
podcast you can be the teacher I'll be

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,460
the student we'll do a little

00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:14,070
role-playing and you can teach me

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,409
computer science in a 20-minute episode

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,090
and we launched and what great people

00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:20,129
love the show they love the premise of

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,830
it they loved our chemistry but then I

00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:25,080
got this one email from the listener who

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:29,549
said hey Lily love your show

00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:32,100
because the thing is I'm blind and a lot

00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:34,649
of technical resources just aren't

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,080
accessible to me I can't use them

00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:39,240
because they involve reading viewing

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,440
images viewing code and so I just can't

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,539
use them and this is one of the few

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,570
resources that I can use because I can't

00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:48,059
see and I read that and I thought wow I

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,919
never thought of podcasting as an

00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:51,629
accessibility solution as an

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,669
accessibility tool this is this is

00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:55,740
fascinating it's very humbling but it

00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:58,889
made me think what about all the people

00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:02,220
that can't hear what are we doing to

00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:03,929
make our podcast accessible to them so

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,820
that email really taught me about

00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:07,740
accessibility in the context of

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,230
podcasting and so we took that

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,750
information and we iterated and we

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,669
created transcripts so now all of our

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,769
episodes both the cotan of a podcast and

00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:20,700
the basis podcast they all come with

00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:23,940
transcripts now here's the thing if that

00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,730
one person hadn't spoken up we wouldn't

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,429
have transcripts that was not an idea

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:33,269
that came from me that was an idea that

00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:35,250
came from our community so we've got

00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:36,809
three projects going on got the best

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,820
podcast the couldn't be podcast and the

00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,590
kodan to be Twitter chats now you might

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,360
notice that all these things are online

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,820
which is great that makes them

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,649
incredibly accessible that means that

00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,809
anybody with an internet connection can

00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:50,730
join they can take that content they can

00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:54,509
participate and that is a great thing to

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:57,269
have but the truth is in person

00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:58,289
connections are just so valuable and I

00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,520
think you can appreciate that because

00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:01,560
you're all here at

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,080
friends there's something really special

00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,920
about being in person there's something

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,270
really valuable about that experience in

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,310
conferences have always been a huge part

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,860
of my development as a developer they've

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:16,080
been a really big part of my career and

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,840
my ability to simply network make new

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,910
friends but what I understood is that

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,370
most conferences aren't great for

00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:25,830
newbies they're not really designed for

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,120
that community so I decided I was going

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,980
to do something about it and I'm going

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,280
to build a conference and it's gonna be

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:35,610
called code Lynette but what makes a

00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,100
magical conference especially for our

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,390
community how do you make a

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,000
specially-designed magical conference

00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,740
for them well the first thing that you

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,930
need to do is you need to have a

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,150
conference where people can follow and

00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,950
understand the talks now this might seem

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,200
really obvious after all why have a talk

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,300
people can't follow it but for the

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,090
beginner audience this is a huge pain

00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:02,580
point because the thing is when talks

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:04,320
are labeled intro to or TDD 101 it's not

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,420
really for people who are new to tech

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,700
it's for people who are new to that

00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,380
technology which is different we all

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,240
know that that first programming

00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,170
language we learn is the hardest one

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,750
after that

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:17,130
adding isn't really that big of a deal

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,050
we just learn a little bit more and

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,420
maybe take some time but definitely not

00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:23,150
as hard as learning that first language

00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,110
so when we're moving between

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,660
technologies and we're adding

00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:30,720
technologies onto our personal stack

00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,460
it's not as painful but when you have no

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,520
stack at all it's a really painful

00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:38,730
experience so how do you make sure that

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,740
all these talks are understandable to

00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,020
our community we created these

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,690
conference booklets I'm very very proud

00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,460
of these conference booklets are an

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,050
accompaniment to the conference and

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,910
they're full of a couple things they're

00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,260
full of what you would expect from a

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,990
conference program they have the

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,080
abstract bio a photo of the speaker but

00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,970
it also has terms and resources so as a

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,100
speaker as I'm going through my really

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,350
complex code I'm going through my

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,510
process for building it you'll be able

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,370
to follow along with me you'll see a

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,710
list of all the terms that I use in my

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,760
top and the definitions so if I say

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,400
something in passing the

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,930
you're not familiar with that's okay you

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,820
can pause you can take a look down at

00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,520
your booklet and you're able to pick up

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,650
where you left off and if you want to

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,540
learn more about what I talked about if

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,430
you want to learn about more resources

00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:30,510
that's available in the conference

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:32,880
booklet as well the other thing that I

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,790
really focused on with newbies is that

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,650
newbies need to know the why when you're

00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,680
first starting that context is

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,720
incredibly important it's hard to get

00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,610
excited about technology just for the

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,780
sake of technology because you're not

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,970
quite there yet you can't really

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,130
appreciate the tech for the tip you need

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,140
to understand the application of it that

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,690
becomes really really important

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,640
especially at the beginning we need to

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,830
have the context why am I using this

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,610
where am I using this who does this

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,460
effect

00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:04,770
all those things add up to a why that's

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:09,270
incredibly important so how do you make

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:11,100
sure that each talk has that why well

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,110
you work with every single speaker and

00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,460
that's what I did I worked with each and

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,010
every one of our speakers averaging

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,830
about three to four hours per talk and I

00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:22,140
made sure that they felt prepared and

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,210
they addressed that why and that they

00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,880
felt confident in speaking about their

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:29,160
topic and we wrote the story of the talk

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,540
together we did the outline together we

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,700
worked on the slides together and we

00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,710
rehearse together and that allowed me to

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,170
do some quality control and really make

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:40,440
sure the talks were catered and designed

00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:42,240
for this newbie audience the third and

00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,160
final thing we focused on was making

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,250
sure these this conference was

00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,890
financially accessible this is a huge

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,410
deal as you all know conferences are

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,270
very expensive ticket prices range from

00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:57,090
a couple hundred to thousands of dollars

00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:59,010
but even if the tickets are free the

00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:02,280
cost of going to a conference is very

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,840
expensive the hotel's the flight the

00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,970
childcare that you have to pay all these

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,580
things add up to to quite a bunch of

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,470
money and a lot of folks probably a lot

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,180
of you here get sponsorships from your

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,940
companies they pay for you to be here or

00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,860
they at least subsidize your trip but

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,380
for our community people who aren't at

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,820
those tech companies yet they're still

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,860
working as a teacher they're still

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,220
working as a journalist they don't have

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,409
that company's support so there

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,659
always paying out of pocket so we

00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:32,270
decided to do to help alleviate some of

00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:34,250
that financial burden as we created a

00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,590
scholarship we called it the opportunity

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,990
scholarship and this not only gave you a

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,789
heavily discounted ticket but it paid

00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,409
for your flight your childcare in your

00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:44,750
hotel basically any of the expenses you

00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:46,820
need covered to make sure you can get to

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,400
the conference and you can enjoy this

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,100
experience and we were able to bring

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:55,549
over 150 people to cone land over the

00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:58,280
past two years so things are going great

00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:59,480
people love this conference people say

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,620
that they're making new friends and

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,210
learning about new tools and

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,390
technologies they're having a great time

00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,309
but here's the thing about conferences

00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:09,320
there's a lot you can get right but a

00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:13,100
whole lot more that you can get wrong

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,380
and unlike a product you can't deploy a

00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,700
new-build of a conference right once

00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,130
it's out there it's kind of done that's

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,039
it you have to wait a year to figure out

00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:24,590
what went wrong and how to fix it

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,150
so here all the things that I missed

00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,970
here all the things that I learned from

00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,980
that first conference I learned that I

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,240
should have had closed captioning that

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,250
was something that didn't occur to me

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,450
didn't think about it at all someone

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,159
brought it up maybe a couple weeks

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,690
before the conference started and they

00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,000
said hey are you gonna do closed

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:43,429
captioning and I thought oh I wish I

00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,659
thought of that sooner childcare was

00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:46,580
another big one didn't think about

00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:48,740
childcare as someone who doesn't have

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,620
kids that just wasn't top of mind for me

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,900
didn't think about it dietary

00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,669
restrictions this one we actually did a

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,010
pretty good job on because we did ask

00:25:55,669 --> 00:26:00,049
people what their dietary requirements

00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,970
were and we made sure that we had food

00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:03,679
that accounted for everyone and that

00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:09,289
gave them what they needed but what we

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:10,640
forgot was to label the food so no one

00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,039
knew what they could eat and what they

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,320
couldn't eat feels like a very minor

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,929
detail change the whole lunch experience

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,510
for everyone the last one was

00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:23,840
photography and privacy so this one

00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:25,760
actually came to me from a tweet so this

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,130
is a tweet by Stephanie Hurlburt who's

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,620
pretty big in the gaming and compression

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:33,289
space and she tweeted I love this idea

00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,270
for events and conferences it helps some

00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:36,860
people feel more comfortable but it

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,930
would have helped me attend events at

00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,790
all after I escaped and Abby

00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,040
relationship and was worried about

00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:45,200
stocking I wasn't able to go to any

00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,000
events for months and that sign that you

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,300
see says please do not photograph

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,640
attendees with this sticker and that

00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,980
tweet came to my attention from this

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,110
other tweet by a woman named hunter and

00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,790
she says hey code newbies maybe you all

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,370
can do something like this for code land

00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:03,500
just the simple yes or no on whether a

00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,730
person wants a sticker at check-in would

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,910
be super easy

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,850
I said yes under it would be super easy

00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:14,390
so next year was my chance to fix all

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:16,160
these things : 2018 was on its way and

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm gonna get everything right

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,470
so I iterated and I got that closed

00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,240
captioning we had a child care fund to

00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,850
help subsidize child care costs for

00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,890
people we got those labels for those the

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,660
dietary restrictions for lunch and we

00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:33,260
had those stickers for photography and

00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:36,050
privacy but here's the thing if all

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:39,710
those people hadn't spoken up we

00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:42,440
wouldn't have a better conference so the

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,720
end of : 2018 I give my closing remarks

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,370
I thank everyone for being there and I

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,680
tell them about all the things that

00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,120
we've gotten wrong that first year and I

00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,400
said thank you so much for all your

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,020
feedback for all your input it's because

00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,360
of you that were able to make a better a

00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,310
stronger conference this time thank you

00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,590
all so much if you have any additional

00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:04,040
feedback please let me know very welcome

00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,660
very excited to hear it so back to my

00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,190
room conference is over

00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,460
sitting at my desk sitting at my

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,170
computer I opened my email my inbox is

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:17,270
full of all the things that I missed

00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:18,400
that year so here are a few of them one

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,880
person talked about having

00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,850
environmentally-friendly

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,530
options so what we did the first year in

00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,270
the second year is we had a lot of water

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,740
bottles because water bottles are

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,540
portable they're really easy just grab

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,340
them you go won't be any you know bottle

00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,320
necks and huge lines for water and my

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,760
one thing when it came to the conference

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,190
is I wanted to make sure everyone was

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,720
hydrated it's very important to me so

00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,520
water bottles seem like a great solution

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,410
didn't really think about all the

00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,210
plastic that we were using by having

00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:46,000
water bottles and someone brought that

00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:48,740
attention brought that to my attention

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,910
the other thing was a prayer room this

00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,690
was something that didn't occur to me

00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:55,060
until someone actually noticed a couple

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:57,040
who were looking for a private space at

00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,820
the conference to pray something that

00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,190
didn't occur to me

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,380
the third is someone requested a

00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,320
low-carb lunch okay so let me explain

00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,240
this one there was one lunch called the

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,370
summer picnic I was very excited about

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,060
this lunch it was fried chicken mashed

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:15,910
potatoes mac and cheese corn bran potato

00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,390
salad all the good stuff and I'm

00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:21,820
thinking this lunch is gonna be a hit

00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,020
turns out it's very very heavy and when

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,250
you're sitting in a cotton is a one

00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,530
track conference when you're sitting in

00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,630
a conference room for eight nine hours

00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,150
sitting in that one terrific you get

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,160
sleepy it gets warm with all those human

00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,020
bodies in a room and you get a little

00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,750
sleepy and it's harder to stay awake if

00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,010
your stomach is full of mashed potatoes

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,970
didn't think about that I just thought

00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:44,380
it was a really great lunch another

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,550
piece of feedback we got that again

00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,380
would never ever occurred to me was

00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,830
someone requested having bigger seats

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:53,380
this was a larger woman and she said

00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,120
look I was physically uncomfortable the

00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,520
whole conference because your seats are

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,440
just too small and I thought yeah I

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,210
would never thought about thinking about

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,550
furniture and how the furniture

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:05,200
experience is for attendees now you

00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,820
might look at this list and go well

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,490
these aren't deal-breakers they're not

00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:12,490
huge but for the people experiencing

00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,800
them they are a really big deal this was

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,410
a list of all the things that I didn't

00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,050
think about and I felt so grateful for

00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:22,090
all their feedback then I got this email

00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,890
from this one woman who gave some very

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,330
thorough feedback and she said these are

00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,520
all the things you can improve next year

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,500
and I respond and I said thank you so

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,260
much for your feedback very very helpful

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,000
in fact it was so helpful that you

00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,860
should go to other people's conferences

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,900
sit in the audience experience them and

00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,610
give them feedback we have so much more

00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,820
so much better conferences if we did

00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:45,850
that and she said to me oh no I don't do

00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:48,730
this for everybody I did this for you

00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:51,730
because I know then you'll do something

00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,860
about it and this is very interesting to

00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:57,820
me because it reframed all this feedback

00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:00,280
that I had received this wasn't an inbox

00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,920
full of all the things I've gotten wrong

00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,940
it was an inbox full of people who

00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:09,720
believed that I cared enough

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,120
to fix it but how do they know a lot of

00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,519
the work of a Community Builder

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,559
community organizer is in the dark no

00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,360
one sees me lugging hundreds of booklets

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,389
to my car hoping they're gonna fit in my

00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,279
suitcase no one sees the individual DMS

00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:25,200
of people who have different concerns

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,600
and questions about the conference no

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,190
one sees all the hours I put in working

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,570
with each and every one of our speakers

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,149
to make sure they feel ready and

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,620
equipped for their big day no one sees

00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:37,100
all these things they're not done in

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,720
front of an audience so how do they know

00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,549
the only interactions that they see are

00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,200
really small ones they see little

00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:44,370
individual tweets they see the

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,820
occasional announcement everybody

00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:49,289
occasional email blasts that's really it

00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,450
there's nothing I can point you to say

00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:54,629
look at this thing right here I did this

00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:57,240
this proves to you then you can trust me

00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:59,370
there's no app to point to there's no

00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,980
product to point to there's no repo to

00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,320
point to so how do they know there were

00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,470
just a lot of little things that I've

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,210
been doing for a really long time and

00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:12,360
that's because it's really about these

00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:14,519
small consistent acts that build trust

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,190
that's what community building is really

00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,840
all about it's about constantly going

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,840
through this loop of understanding

00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,059
building listening iterating even when

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,039
no one is watching even when people have

00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:29,070
no idea that you're going through this

00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,019
loop no matter how big or how small the

00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,330
thing is this loop is incredibly

00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:35,759
important this is what real community

00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:39,259
building looks like this is how you make

00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:41,730
people feel safe and welcome and want it

00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:44,070
being part of a community is amazing

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,110
it's a beautiful beautiful feeling to

00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:48,000
find people who are just like you who

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,759
care about things you care about who

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,139
share your values who can help you grow

00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:54,450
and support you into being a better

00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:57,990
person a better developer but for the

00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:59,789
organizer it's just a lot of work and

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:03,059
it's a lot of work that never seems to

00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:04,500
end and I remember as a kid watching my

00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:06,690
mom running around but every single

00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,970
gathering every single meal and she'd

00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:13,019
always collapsed into a chair afterwards

00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:14,340
and she'd go oh I'm so tired she would

00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,559
kill me for doing that accent but that

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,750
is very very accurate it's exactly what

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,800
she sounded like and I was look at her

00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,270
and I would go oh man

00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,280
I never want to do that that looks like

00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:25,380
a lot of work you know how when you go

00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,390
up and you find yourself slowly becoming

00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,650
like one of your parents but you start

00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,360
kind of like saying things the way they

00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,040
do and you have gestures the way they

00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,390
have gestures and even though I pick up

00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,820
the phone and say hi how are you it's

00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:37,080
exactly like the way my mom does it but

00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:41,340
when it comes to building a community

00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:43,700
all I ever wanted was to be like her all

00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,520
I want is to make you feel safe and

00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:53,980
welcome and wanted thank you

00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,980
[Applause]

00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:58,849
