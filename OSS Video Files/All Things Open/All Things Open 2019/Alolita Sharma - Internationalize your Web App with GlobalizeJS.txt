Description: 
	GlobalizeJS is one of the most popular open source JavaScript internationalization (i18n) libraries used by web applications today. This library is used by large enterprises and by startups. It interfaces with client platforms (e.g., via React) and server implementations (e.g., via NodeJS). GlobalizeJS uses Unicode CLDR locale data and closely follows the Unicode Technical Specification (UTS 35). This talk will introduce key features of GlobalizeJS and highlight new capabilities, performance optimizations and data distribution mechanisms. The talk will also cover feature requests yet to be implemented and how you can contribute to GlobalizeJS.
