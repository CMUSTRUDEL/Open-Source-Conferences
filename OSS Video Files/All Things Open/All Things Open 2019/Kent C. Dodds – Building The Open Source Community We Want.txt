Publication date: 2019-11-05
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	What kind of world do you want to live in? The world of Open Source Software is supremely vast, and it’s growing. We can’t sit idly by, coding alone in our closets with an attitude of “if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.” We don’t want to live in a world like that. The community we want to build around OSS requires intentional effort to maximize the happiness of everyone involved. And the rewards of working toward that goal are serene. I’d like to personally welcome you to the open source community. Bring your distinctiveness an

get nervous when they stand in front of

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,820
a group of people to speak okay I'm not

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,260
the only one I want to talk with you

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,960
about building the open source community

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,340
that we want and I'm gonna tell you a

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,460
couple of stories and I want to start

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,550
out with my own story my open source

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,579
story so as John mentioned I maintain a

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:07,530
lot of packages online on NPM primarily

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:09,240
on a JavaScript engineer and I some of

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,080
those packages I've inherited others

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,340
I've handed off to other maintainer x'

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,430
and many of those I'm actively

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,759
maintaining today but of course I didn't

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,460
start in the world of open source as a

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,110
maintainer of projects I like everybody

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,020
else who has been involved in open

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,750
source had my very first pull request

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,560
and I wanna show you that so this is my

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,680
first pull request I it's a Java

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,520
framework called the play framework and

00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:44,299
I just fixed the typo and added an extra

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,909
line to the end of the file

00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:49,909
but what yeah thank you

00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,540
what's striking to me about this what's

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,870
special to me about this is not only

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,270
that it was my first pole request but

00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,220
the experience that I had in creating

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,260
that pole request I think that people

00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,560
when they create their their first ever

00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,090
pull request they're nervous and they're

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,230
not sure that they're doing things right

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,850
they're worried that they're gonna do

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,230
something wrong and with my experience

00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:21,420
James who is the maintainer of that

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,810
project and said yeah thank you so much

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,850
here's the CLA could you please sign

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,500
that and I did that and then it was

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:33,510
merge the next day so the thing that I

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,500
think is most notable about this

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,790
experience is what James said we're all

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,560
gonna die eventually so we have a

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,340
limited number of keystrokes left for

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,430
the rest of our lives

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,660
right and James gave me 32 of his

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,280
keystrokes to say thank you and I think

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,540
it probably was just kind of a natural

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,970
thing that he did and but it made me as

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,560
a brand new contributor feel welcome and

00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,110
feel like I had a place in the

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,150
open-source community and that's kind of

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,239
what I want to talk about is the type of

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,820
open-source community that we are trying

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,830
to build in our different corners of

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,989
this community that we're a part of I

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,030
want to tell you another story this is

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,959
one that I heard recently about a woman

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,390
named Sharon Adams

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,519
when Sharon was a little girl she lived

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,910
in a community called Lindsay Heights in

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,799
Milwaukee Wisconsin and she loved her

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,690
neighborhood she would go on walks she'd

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,450
walk to school she would talk with

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,280
neighbors and people would just sit on

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,950
their porch and talk to each other it

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,620
was a really nice community and then

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,970
Sharon grew up she moved away she left

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,060
in New York for almost 30 years

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:46,410
and then she moved back to the very same

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,690
home that she grew up in and she was not

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,390
really excited about the changes that

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,209
had taken place it was a dangerous

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,580
community there were drugs and violence

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,910
and all sorts of unsavory things going

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,250
on in that area and she

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,160
actually had three police captain's tell

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,910
her don't go out even during the day

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,220
because it's dangerous and gunshots were

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:15,090
a regular occurrence pretty much every

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,500
day she was really saddened by the the

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,180
change that had happened in her

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,850
community the the one that she grew up

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,290
in that she loved and she defied the

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,710
police captain's and just went on walks

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,590
anyway despite the dangers which were

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,360
real and and she saw and experienced it

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,250
and her neighbors experienced many of

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,340
those dangers but she invited her

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,320
neighbors to go walking with her anyway

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,900
but it wasn't you know walks aren't

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,850
going to change that community and one

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,520
Christmas night she and her husband

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,610
Larry were looking out the window and

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,770
saw this house across the street and

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,090
there were lights flickering and Sharon

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,010
said what are they are they lighting

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,930
camera candles like that's an abandoned

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,120
house nobody lives there and her husband

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,860
said no they're they're doing drugs over

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,840
there and they looked at each other and

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,850
they said this is not right this is not

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,670
the community that we want to live in

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,370
and I think many of us would say okay

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:11,400
well let's let's move on to a place

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,960
where we feel safer but they looked at

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,390
each other and said that's this isn't

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,430
right and Larry was a contractor and

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,730
Sharon said Larry that's that's your

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,400
next job is that house and so they work

00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,590
together and they totally remodeled the

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,660
house they they made it into something

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,270
that eventually was sold to a first-time

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,860
homebuyer through a loan that they

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:36,600
facilitated that was a low-interest loan

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:39,120
and then they started doing this to many

00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,250
other houses in the area and to the

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,530
state they have renovated over a hundred

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,360
homes in the area there were a bunch of

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,580
empty lots in the area as well and those

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,890
had turned into dump heaps where people

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,720
would dump their tires or refrigerators

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,580
or TVs things that you can't easily get

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,860
rid of and they were just dump it in

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,010
these empty lots they cleaned all those

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,810
up and they put in fruit orchards and

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,140
they grow over 400 pounds of fruit every

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,390
year now she's just remarkable that they

00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,550
put the community together to turn this

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,820
into the place that they wanted to live

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,240
in

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,860
and they this is what one of the

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,990
insights of the homes looked like at the

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,480
time that they started renovating -

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,910
after they finished and they've been

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,250
able to turn this community completely

00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,320
around the crime rate has dropped

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,630
significantly in the last 20 years that

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,430
they've been working on making this

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,320
community one that they wanted - they

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,880
went to other communities that were the

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,160
type of community they wanted to have

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,720
and they learned from the things that

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,560
those communities were doing and applied

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,500
it to their own they and they've started

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,390
expanding beyond their own Lyndsey

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,880
heights community into surrounding

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,970
communities and they formed a nonprofit

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,730
called the walnut waste a walnut way

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,340
nonprofit - to facilitate doing all of

00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:00,300
these things and I this year they've

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,250
accumulated 50 million dollar grant to

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,930
continue in their efforts I don't know

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,510
if you noticed but this is actually the

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,910
home in that first picture they

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,560
renovated the home and and it was sold

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,940
to a first-time homebuyer but I guess

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,820
they they bought it and now it's the

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:21,100
walnut way center totally different

00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:22,630
experience so the reason that I of

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,720
course I think this is an inspirational

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,670
story for anyone the thing that I find

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,640
so inspirational about Sharon and Larry

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:33,850
is that moments that Christmas night

00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,260
when they saw you know people doing

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,300
things that they didn't think we're

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,790
appropriate and were the part of the

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,400
community that they wanted they were in

00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:45,730
this community that they felt unsafe

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,940
physically emotionally and many other

00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,190
ways and I don't think any of us could

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,530
blame them if they decided to move away

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:57,520
move to a community that had more shared

00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,990
values and I'm just going to be

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,060
perfectly frank nobody should judge

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,100
anyone for leaving a community where

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:07,120
they feel physically or emotionally or

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,820
mentally unsafe what's remarkable about

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,760
Sharon and Larry is that they didn't and

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,200
they stayed anyway and they made the

00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,980
community the place that they wanted to

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:20,530
live so how does this apply to our open

00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,140
source software community that we're

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:26,040
trying to build

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,260
so I I like this picture this person in

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,700
a bat and birthday hat they've got a

00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,680
wonderful experience that they're having

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,360
and they're sharing that experience with

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,220
you know the person who's taking the

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,180
picture and other people in the in the

00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:43,260
shot and that's kind of what open source

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,880
is it's a wonderful experience where we

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,560
that we get to share with other people

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,930
we create this thing and we want to

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,390
share it with others and I think that's

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,250
a special thing about it open source and

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,600
I like to think of open sources and just

00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:00,080
the general tougher community as kind of

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,550
we're all holding these torches and

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,500
let's say only one of ours is lit and

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,410
let's say mine's late and I say hey Joe

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,680
I'm going to light your torch and all

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,660
that takes for me is just a little bit

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,240
of effort to light someone else's torch

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,130
and my torch is not diminished in any

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,420
way it's just as bright as it always was

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:23,370
and now Joe's torch is light lit and so

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,110
not only is he benefited from that

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,510
experience but actually all of us are

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,100
benefited from that experience because

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,840
now you have two lights in the room and

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,270
eventually we'll just light this whole

00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,350
room out that's actually a bad metaphor

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:39,990
sorry but hopefully you get the idea

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,450
that it takes a so little effort to make

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,780
such a big impact and the effort that it

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:49,860
takes is is pretty much just intention

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:51,720
and so what's what's the kind of

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,150
intentional open-source community that

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,890
we want to build the kind of open-source

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,340
community I want to be a part of is one

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:01,530
that helps people when they stumble that

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:05,300
is encouraging to people who are just

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:07,470
getting started and and rather than

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,450
looking at somebody who's fallen and

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,020
laughing or just ignoring them or hoping

00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:15,390
somebody else takes care of that problem

00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,490
that we step it up and we help other

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:21,240
people in their their struggles to

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,950
acclimate to this community the kind of

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,330
open-source community I want to be a

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:30,450
part of is one that defines and enforces

00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,910
good behavior so things like can shoot

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,350
the code of conduct for projects I use

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,399
the contributor covenant it's a great

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,069
code of conduct on my project

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,619
and what what I think the nice thing

00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:44,829
about having a code of conduct on your

00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:47,559
projects is that it not only does it

00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:50,739
deter bad acting but it actually

00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:54,009
encourages people who stand to gain from

00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:56,199
from feeling safe in that community so

00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:57,819
people see that you have a code of

00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:00,399
conduct and you're interested in

00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:02,109
maintaining a positive experience for

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,759
everyone in the community and they feel

00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:08,499
like they can come in and contribute I

00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:11,470
think there's a a non-trivial amount of

00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:13,359
people who feel unsafe in the community

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,720
and it's up to us to make them feel

00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:19,480
safer the part of the community that I

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,730
want to be a part of is uplifting and

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,109
helpful especially to new people

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,109
contributing through the open-source

00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:27,399
world so things like first timers only

00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:30,429
this thing that Scott Hanselman and I

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,559
started a few years ago about making

00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:35,470
special issues for brand new

00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,119
contributors is exactly the types of

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,519
initiatives that I want to see more in

00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:40,899
the open-source community doing some

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,699
hand-holding for these people who are

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,519
just getting started I think is an

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:47,489
important thing that it's a part of the

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,649
community that I want to be a part of

00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:52,179
and by making it easier for these people

00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:54,160
who are just getting started we can

00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:58,779
welcome them and their distinctiveness

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,449
into our our collective world of

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,639
open-source the part of the community I

00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:05,769
want to be a part of recognizes people

00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,509
for their contributions so this all

00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:10,569
contributors initiative that I started a

00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:12,610
few years ago recognizes people who

00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:14,230
contribute to open source projects and

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,569
recognizes that those people aren't just

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:21,089
in the contribution graph that github

00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:24,189
gives you but it's so many others and so

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:25,899
thanking them for the contributions that

00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:28,449
they're actually making to the project I

00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,879
think is a wonderful thing and it's

00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:33,309
definitely the type of change that I

00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,699
want or the type of community that I

00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:38,980
want to live in in open-source so this

00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:42,189
is my challenge to you I would like you

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:45,819
to stop typing at the keyboard stop

00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:49,130
adding your features at just pause for a

00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:53,340
moment look up from your computer

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:56,670
inspired um you know looking at it in an

00:12:53,340 --> 00:13:00,060
inspired direction for some sort of

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:03,000
inspiration from above and think how was

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,040
my community doing well we're all in

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,380
different corners of the open-source

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,839
community I I'm in the JavaScript

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,800
specifically react side of things lots

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,570
of testing you may be in the DevOps side

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,480
of the open source world wherever you

00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:20,940
are how can you make your corner of the

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,820
community a better one what are the

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,830
rough spots or the less smooth spots of

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,130
your community and what are things that

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,990
you can do to smooth those things out

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:34,350
some intentional community building and

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,570
improvement is what I want to see and I

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,839
one of the things that I believe firmly

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:43,320
is that it begins with us it begins with

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,720
our own behavior and we can lead the

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,600
rest of the community in the direction

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:54,270
that we want our community to go and

00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:57,360
actually I just want to say that before

00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:00,390
this conference in particular pod it is

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,400
an amazing person I don't know if you

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,760
know like if you've interacted with Todd

00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:09,660
but this conference is absolutely odd

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,170
made manifest Wow

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:15,300
he I want to be like Todd when I grew up

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,770
just an amazing person and I hope you

00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,470
get a chance to talk with him even just

00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:23,490
for a minute and I always leave happier

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,589
after I talk with Todd so be the type of

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,170
person that you want in your community

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:31,500
and that happens it just naturally will

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,120
come and once you've decided that the

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,370
things that you can do to improve your

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,740
community then I hope you take those

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,850
things and you do something great thank

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,919
you very much

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,919
[Applause]

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,789
