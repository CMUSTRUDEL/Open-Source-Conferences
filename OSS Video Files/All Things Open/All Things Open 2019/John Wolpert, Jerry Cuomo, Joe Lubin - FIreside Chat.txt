Description: 
	Divergence & Convergence in the Open Source Blockchain Community

Join John Wolpert and friends in a lively discussion of the recent history of open source in blockchain, including the advent of Ethereum, Hyperledger and open sourceâ€™s role in the great blockchain divergence of 2015 and the convergence starting to happen in 2019 across both the pubic and private blockchain camps.

00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:30,269
the people in consensus and this is

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:31,830
Perry Como arrow and the money will get

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:36,660
into some impressions in men

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:49,680
I'm here to moderate historic fireside

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:51,329
chat with two leaders or are gonna it's

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,649
a good read

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,480
this is going to be over the top

00:00:52,649 --> 00:01:00,719
pocketed source and I was changed in the

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,320
teens by the last five years of life and

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,659
history and we have two people who make

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,390
a lot of industry and we're gonna talk

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:16,830
about their experiences let's think that

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:19,560
set things up back in 1997 lady had two

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,950
lessons and open source one was that

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,200
working out and the other ones I got

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,060
both of the state called outdoors and

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,579
both of those things work really

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,579
strictly speaking open source waiting

00:01:44,990 --> 00:02:09,420
one big thing we cut open s our sense of

00:01:49,920 --> 00:02:11,310
openness and it's both into a number of

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,680
different blocks and organizations and

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,080
dance and foundations and now putting

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,880
into sort of emerged as period where

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,070
we're starting to see standards and

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,060
we're starting seeing formerly this

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:30,420
great thing so that's the story

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:32,850
favorites so Jerry an instrument

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:38,209
people's that's being time commuter all

00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:52,470
the stood forth and comatose I Joe was

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:56,420
one founders of so a major source be

00:02:52,470 --> 00:03:01,049
interested in compliance and consensus

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:03,600
anxious to go into a student not build a

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,489
good point Minh to create a new thing so

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,910
that was sort of the divergence moment

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:11,480
and then just a few months after the

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,480
launch

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:26,140
organization right so that those words

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,620
should be conversions moments and you

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,600
managed to not burn bridges and and

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,000
steal and burn all that time when you

00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:39,730
guys talk about how do you actually do

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:51,040
that they can't own I'm Travis in the

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:54,730
state yeah okay yeah created so so if

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,080
you're in lost its main that at the end

00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,080
of July 2015

00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,219
[Music]

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:13,450
there was IMT project called the depth

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:19,390
which had luminaries like all Brody

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:21,220
Tocqueville curvy Department and four

00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,730
other people were doing the heavy

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:28,960
lifting on that project and it basically

00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:33,310
was a migration with Samsung music bit

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:37,020
plant Tasha Jeremy Laura dysentery more

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:40,240
than I'm used to start that project and

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,880
enabled three months protocol called a

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,920
theory you're auditioning proof of

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:50,560
concept of five and that project was

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,360
just a revelation to us we were this

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,589
this little

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,589
[Music]

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:43,759
so test fast forward a few months and

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:46,759
after being kept with somewhere IRA

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,849
called me on the phone call with getting

00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:53,289
the top which was not unusual and

00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:57,289
another person named John Beaufort and I

00:05:53,289 --> 00:06:03,370
tried to reach that Metallica leave on a

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:06,710
call because we were excited about IBM

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,039
validating our project and we were aware

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,960
that one of the differential models

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,469
strong commercial model about animals

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,020
disengage their writing to weight over

00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:20,630
the source projects and writing them are

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:26,419
making them successful the limits

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:29,100
actually was etc and we thought hey

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:33,770
wouldn't that be wonderful if

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:37,050
really yet - who is your project and you

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:42,660
were thinking otherwise you have he

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:44,840
stops dead while say nice things about

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,920
the people with the project he felt like

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:52,220
the GPL was a big problem front end and

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,130
that made a lot of sense it has been a

00:06:52,220 --> 00:07:02,040
common basis every time so he wanted to

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:06,810
see MIT or actually - and ultimately if

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:11,070
we came now to perhaps do not like to

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:13,650
hitch your wagon to videos with

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,560
switzerland-based Foundation consisting

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:24,930
of a bunch of her dentists as we work

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:26,880
through the time so it wasn't a little

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:32,070
music mystery but dating wasn't really

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:34,080
that difficult for us to be technically

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:42,180
open we were in the source project from

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:48,900
the start honestly and exploring the

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:53,070
solutions based and so we started after

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:57,320
the venison and we Americans Americans

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,320
even in those early days

00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:20,279
what was your experience that was and

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:30,849
many of us were also who who were

00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:33,579
fellows - so we were getting all the

00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:36,370
feedback we're very excited sure

00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:39,129
shockwave when he he begin to talk to

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,509
the CEO you're just a little object then

00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:42,699
he got at least a pass

00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:46,660
so we got a lot of nice to be back we

00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:48,759
were hearing customers and quite frankly

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,300
pastas technologists trying to get our

00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:55,480
arms around first of all this technology

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,699
under Bitcoin then aetherium really

00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,649
change the world or this notion of smart

00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:01,959
contracts and that's when kind of the

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,899
fire phenomenon is a lot we thought why

00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,399
this technology not just food currency -

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:13,329
any English supply chains across

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:15,389
financial services commerce et cetera so

00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:18,579
we really started getting excited but

00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:21,459
permissionless piece and the enemy at

00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:24,309
those creeps some of our customers have

00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:27,009
and reload comments yeah

00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:30,050
and in 2015 we were all in on the area

00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:33,350
and we're looking at ways that

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,689
and actually make the participants and

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,929
that work more comfortable more known to

00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:41,720
the network know the tradition octane it

00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:45,410
also became into looking at that and in

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:49,279
the ER it was spot focused on building

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:51,790
out I mean that different concerns when

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,739
you're building an operational Network

00:09:51,790 --> 00:10:03,939
versus source code that you'd like to

00:09:54,739 --> 00:10:11,869
England so we saw the plug-in a new

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:14,869
labor shortage first and with that we

00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:18,019
really felt we owed it to our customers

00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:22,540
to get our arms around the meeting of

00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:27,619
blockchain accountability privacy

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:30,290
performance and use with everything

00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:32,179
we're hearing from them so we started to

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,249
instead of armies these are several

00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:37,519
versions and we were trying to join that

00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:40,220
with what does this mean and frankly

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,740
even be told and you know people like

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,290
Metallica were way ahead thinking about

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,779
launching for several years he was just

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,389
starting to get our own friend and code

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:53,029
talks so we did the best way we can

00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:56,029
really understand block team meets

00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:58,339
analyze recycle starting material code

00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,889
right and that's why you know we started

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:02,929
coding and when to talk to our friends

00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:05,679
at the Women's Foundation and they're

00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,679
the gold standard

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,909
[Music]

00:11:22,130 --> 00:12:08,549
so in the last few years especially

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,549
[Music]

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:27,410
warrants diverging and tiresome great

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,940
design thinking in poverty whether it's

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,279
purposeful or just the natural

00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:39,750
progression here to see this but the

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:44,279
view of collaboration and things start

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,560
to become pointless to reinvent the

00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,230
wheel

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,649
very slightly it is a very escalate the

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,600
beautiful part about divergence and all

00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:55,819
things being equal they would have been

00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:07,629
wonderful football started on same thing

00:12:55,819 --> 00:13:07,629
but if we have unfortunately not just

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:22,850
saw to looking at toget various power

00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:25,639
zero knowledge proof you need these

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,459
things come through you know I plowed

00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:47,240
with movement right now the question is

00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:49,550
is four years back in 2015 there were

00:13:47,240 --> 00:14:02,509
pretty deep business and philosophical

00:13:49,550 --> 00:14:17,980
issues pretty much of a monster do you

00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:22,300
think that would be a really interesting

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:25,250
the set of discussions but

00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:28,550
philosophically I think the tutors were

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:32,449
too far apart and I think it was much

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:34,610
healthier to diverge and explore

00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:41,410
different regions of the solution space

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:45,040
is generally a good idea too

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,690
have discussions and debates and to

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:53,060
litigate things of the poll request

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:56,420
level but in this case it made a lot of

00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,490
sense to explore very different

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:02,540
philosophies around the distributed

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:08,030
ledger technology is it's important to I

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:11,780
think recognized if forking of projects

00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:19,580
is an incredibly powerful mechanism it's

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:22,610
not to be shot or treated as as an

00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:27,290
illegitimate thing to do I know that

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:31,610
source for cannibalism is very common

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:36,620
and early on your project we felt that

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:39,890
as an open source protocol and as a

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:43,040
running platform that it could

00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:49,700
conceivably be thwart while its

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:53,180
operating that would force us to to be

00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:56,690
more careful in our decision making to

00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:00,130
listen more carefully to try to come to

00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:04,160
social consensus about death whether the

00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:06,140
the philosophy and implementations of

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,570
the system are serving the broad

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,740
community as well as possible now we

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:14,600
knew that if we started to behave badly

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:18,760
that people would just work the project

00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:22,349
away from us render us irrelevant and so

00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,389
as a mechanism and a source

00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:29,259
call 'evil for the inside they're gonna

00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:31,509
be increasingly incredibly important to

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:35,819
the point where I think we should even

00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:39,309
start the community to Florida protocol

00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:42,009
operating protocols enabling the entire

00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:44,169
states be copied over torrent you have

00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:49,419
stateless protocol so that they can see

00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:53,559
to for part of the community who feels

00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:57,189
like the project is inserted them as

00:16:53,559 --> 00:17:00,069
well to essentially important and and

00:16:57,189 --> 00:17:05,139
explore a different sub region of

00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:10,110
solution space absolutely both levels

00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:12,490
state is certainly valuable important to

00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:16,120
operate at the forward west level but

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:19,419
the specter of a major form where it

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:23,949
does like the community and sort of

00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:25,659
adjourn events I think causes us to put

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:32,740
a lot more effort into coming into

00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:41,200
consensus within yeah that makes a lot

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:45,370
of sense actually on how to manage open

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,100
source in this new era and so let's talk

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:52,539
about let's talk about hearings

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:56,380
advances last few years well start with

00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:59,650
and maybe period we talk about advances

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:03,159
and open-source methodology itself with

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:05,049
episode an interval just as why why

00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,990
wooden swords football tables were for

00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:19,000
anything so in a papal gameplay you know

00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:21,220
back in the business to bring market to

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,309
make market and the brain and economy in

00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,659
balance opera and got put my kids

00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:29,770
through school

00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:32,909
let's and right on the open source model

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:37,600
right was money and that's pretty cool

00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:40,480
when he act a certain way and the market

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,320
response intense want to do it began

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,390
weekend development and when I'm

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,900
referring to the property analogies is

00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:52,350
his job and again Java had an open

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,770
approach to integrating move around and

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:59,280
the the cost of code was monitored

00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:03,870
because the rules of engagement were

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:09,929
woman and very kind of low bar it'll

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:13,470
result was innovative companies

00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:15,730
collaborating fiercely biteable

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,400
bringing the best information for the

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:22,780
table or as dollar getting it to

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:26,669
maturity yes there was always the threat

00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:35,159
that it in fourth but the power of

00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:35,159
modularity express the vein

00:19:37,180 --> 00:20:41,910
[Music]

00:19:38,280 --> 00:20:41,910
but without you know what's happening

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:51,390
actually choose but because different

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:57,340
commercial vendors were offering that

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:59,820
you have price competition right so this

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,980
about the reason by working together

00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:06,480
against converging on that thing you

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:10,929
have regular maturity record innovation

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,870
in a record time at agreed price that

00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:16,000
builds market right so the importance

00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:19,270
now to turn it around and start

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,220
converging starting the standard is the

00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,380
target right the flowers have been

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:30,220
gloomy about this one he says this is

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:34,420
going to be the great scene we both

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:37,420
focus to drive innovation to drive that

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:40,030
imagery but we also need diversity of

00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,680
offering right but talk against that

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,950
single

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,590
so I'm going to the University listen

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,840
was went over to the etherion site

00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,840
there's been a lot of diverse input and

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,510
especially the last couple years ago I

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:57,060
talked about letters structure and

00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:01,770
Constantine yep I think this person but

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:05,640
that person this Papa Joe whatever one

00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:20,090
of the notable contributions that are

00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:24,600
coming together to e22 time combination

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:26,970
so the third one has been a remarkably

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,360
successful platform

00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:33,600
it was never expected that it would be

00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:37,230
massively scalable it is a public

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:40,860
permissionless changes the structure for

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:44,280
decentralized applications and it has

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:47,970
proved to me capable of supporting a

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,260
fair amount of activity it was launched

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:53,750
so that we can figure out how

00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:56,490
decentralized applications and perhaps

00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:00,990
decentralized applications in companies

00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:03,960
and see if we could make essentially the

00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:09,140
new approach to building an Internet and

00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:13,080
the decentralized worldwide web work we

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:15,570
conceived of the theory as base

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,080
cosplayer for the planet we conceived of

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:22,910
it as a kind of foundation well they

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:25,679
must move our societies away from

00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:28,899
subjective and Trust infrastruc

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,919
automated objective Trust infrastructure

00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:36,909
we guaranteed execution of agreements

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:40,480
and it is certainly not scalable enough

00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:42,450
to do that first any significant spot of

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,570
activity on the planet right now but

00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:48,340
even now on top of this first attempts

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,470
at building an objective trust

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:53,740
foundation for the planet we're seeing

00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:56,620
the development of a layer that they are

00:23:53,740 --> 00:24:00,250
calling the open decentralized finance

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:04,090
later and so we've been able to build

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:07,630
out systems in a layer that I call the

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:10,480
potential financial layer for the

00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:14,230
emerging decentralized what Wilkinson

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:18,840
able to do that price people towing

00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,840
systems and empowering citizens

00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:32,740
participation system - no pension

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:36,669
systems and so all things being built

00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:39,669
now monetary version one and this awful

00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:43,899
interoperable statistic it's really

00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:46,539
exciting but it's not going to be the

00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:49,590
financial plumbing layer for the planet

00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:53,169
what we he is here in to a serum to

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:57,419
would be the first implementation of

00:24:53,169 --> 00:25:00,340
what I think of as the permanence

00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:03,130
elements of the permanent decentralized

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,559
world wide web and serve people is

00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,500
offering a lot over time the

00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:10,840
decentralized light would

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,480
looks like protocols like a theorem for

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,330
trusted

00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,820
in spirit the execution of agreements of

00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,910
most indecent West or decentralized

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:24,680
annalise.m positive you decentralized

00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:26,810
identity that there 2.0 he is going to

00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,590
be delivered in the three phases of

00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:32,090
their stations get watched in few month

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:35,240
this is coming here coming clean and

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,540
days in the next few phases will

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,660
probably come together before the end of

00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,490
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:45,260
my philosophy ridiculous about so do we

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,760
see a lot of speed from the community

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:51,950
like good if he were talking about defy

00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,650
simple finance this has come from a lot

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,260
of major financial institutions so this

00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,690
open source approach as Lake Kerry was

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:11,090
saying is a lot of different types of

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:12,920
players to play on the single okay to

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,380
you it was hard to hear that one with

00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,620
heard something about attended like

00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,090
legacy financial institutions and open

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,650
decentralized plans

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:26,600
I was saying that the nature of the

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:29,240
theories of open source movement and

00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,770
hopeful title under Antikythera meeting

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,600
was between at the very largest

00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:35,870
over the sort of development communities

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:39,260
in the world and certainly in watch

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:42,950
channel space isn't that that diversity

00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,970
of how you would attract all these

00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:48,230
different passwords

00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:56,240
that event celebrated both being defying

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:59,320
me - absolutely true we're seeing as a

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,960
financial instruments issued on their

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:08,030
most of the decentralized finance

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:10,130
projects are on under others that there

00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:14,440
are legacy financial institutions

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:17,660
lengthen there and others that are

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,900
experimenting by releasing actual bonds

00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:24,020
on the platform and understanding the

00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:28,190
full lifecycle of bond issuance and

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:31,780
coupon payment payment etc of the SOR

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:35,030
contracts the latest financial world is

00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:40,100
figuring out how to use this tremendous

00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:43,190
resource and the startup descent was

00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,920
financed protocol Brooks is building at

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:49,700
all those different cuts in these cases

00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:52,960
before interestingly the it's like

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,190
trying all these things in a single

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,240
single execution space

00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:03,110
they're basically interoperable at the

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:08,180
function level a lending protocol to

00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:10,880
call a precedent protocol etc so all

00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,370
these things are figuring out how to

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,270
most effectively interoperate one

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:19,760
another importantly when you're issuing

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:24,310
financial assets especially as they get

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:27,410
to be really valuable you're gonna have

00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:30,590
natively digital assets that are a

00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,190
protocol tokens maybe representing these

00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,840
my storage

00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,870
the cell representing computation and

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,790
storage those things are very valuable

00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:43,890
to the tune of billions of dollars right

00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:47,800
now our also seen tokens representing

00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:51,870
real estate or other kinds of real-world

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:54,850
assets and those are also going to

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,380
accumulate tremendous value so we've

00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,680
seen ever through a history

00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:02,320
well-resourced Asian actors will tend to

00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:06,520
capture systems systems like my or or

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,920
the London or price dates and so what we

00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:12,310
need a distributed ledger technology is

00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:14,440
what I call maximum decentralization to

00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:17,650
build systems that are incredibly

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:21,010
difficult to cheat and that's that's

00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:26,010
where theory and strength is currently

00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:29,200
there's really no other tended to be a

00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:31,870
foundational trust layer and the global

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,980
settlement layer for highly valuable

00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:38,110
assets especially especially in that

00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:41,410
connective tissue layer right that's

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,410
where there's no where people I guess

00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:47,230
you know two guys on stage your

00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:48,970
middleware people in a way like things

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:53,230
interesting connection and the periods

00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:56,710
becoming an interesting little work yeah

00:29:53,230 --> 00:30:01,570
so it's absolutely happening the worst

00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:05,440
first he made the creation of several

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,300
and of course the area is the gold

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,470
standard

00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:15,600
you know publicly Nets built around

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:18,000
in technology I do think the difference

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,480
between a network and technology helping

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,279
build a network is kind of aware of it

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,769
it's not that the theory doesn't is not

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,710
limited by technology but we're really

00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:30,600
looking at you know enabling any

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,299
enterprise around the world a small

00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,950
everyday that mean into this to to to

00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:40,950
get that makes building smarter

00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:44,220
contracts building up in the sandbox and

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:47,009
then deploying come out starting proc

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,840
possibly even more centralized to me you

00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:51,299
know governments like the US have

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,740
they're not reluctant we need to set our

00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:55,919
government we have three major branches

00:30:52,740 --> 00:31:00,649
and it provides enough balance we can

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,649
argue these days but balance that

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:16,529
Universal you know we see these to the

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:24,210
IBM we've helped 1,100 networks starting

00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:29,690
and production networks right now many

00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:32,580
of those start more centralized with

00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:35,159
truckers and the networks and they're

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:38,960
working to decentralize and it worked

00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:42,379
for example our trust

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,230
started out with very small handful of

00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:49,250
providers

00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:51,629
major food providers and competitors are

00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,730
looking at the governance policy and

00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:56,909
participated in that Marcus day the next

00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,649
step is just is fine you yes married to

00:31:56,909 --> 00:32:00,070
the depends differ and what would say

00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:01,960
what's the difference

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,120
today's between the lines of blurring

00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,570
between public and private networks

00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:11,860
because if you look at you know like

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:13,990
stellar as an example or there

00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,390
these are puppies or public networks

00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:22,330
have a permission right with ver that

00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:24,760
the signing documents private yeah so

00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:27,580
you know we talk about the convergence

00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:30,220
well you know hyper live your fabric

00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,840
technology doesn't know it doesn't kind

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,200
of punches it doesn't mean it doesn't

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,480
know violating republic justice it has

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,370
permission ability you can be very good

00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,960
little impression that can be very yeah

00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,480
so what we're seeing

00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,200
absolutely what drove the steam from the

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:54,520
decentralized side in we're seeing an

00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:59,910
adoption because you look at I just pull

00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,910
one out of the air the video sponsored

00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,739
[Music]

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:24,490
through glass Facebook network

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:27,910
television one stage across university

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:33,430
personal advertisers with the EO to

00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:35,620
watching their efficiency efficiency

00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:37,930
that seems mighty

00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,910
you know up definitely power fear making

00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:42,950
sure that is working right for them and

00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:45,619
it's priced right

00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:48,350
and examples that I am alone around that

00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:49,009
and when you look at type relationship

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,980
option

00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:57,429
the really impressive part is you start

00:33:51,980 --> 00:34:01,909
to kind of sneaking suspicion standard

00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:06,769
Oracle Amazon Microsoft Alibaba Huawei

00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:09,200
Cisco all half a turn based offers right

00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:12,049
in fact we we have 100% guaranteed

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,629
without one percent satisfied with my DM

00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:32,780
providing blocking technology for you we

00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:34,250
will help you go to right so now I want

00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,520
to tell the story about the purchase we

00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,349
talk about that they still in touch a

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,440
little bit of the major plank realtor

00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:45,319
and how it's it's sort of the big tent

00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:49,700
and how it's about only governmental the

00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:52,429
source versus like don't we have open

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:56,929
source thing around personality you know

00:34:52,429 --> 00:35:00,140
both tradition because the Linux

00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:02,210
Foundation codified that into this

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,010
notion that you know their high school

00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:11,150
hit in China today would be a maintainer

00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:15,380
just like the coast emissions great so

00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:17,359
it's got that kind of period you know so

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,339
again it's also about there's all these

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:25,400
different projects in now here's gonna

00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:27,349
do the virions hyper ledger best student

00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,809
project is the first

00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:31,160
etherium name that's actually any

00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:36,490
maintenance

00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:53,770
client available if right so

00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:56,980
another way that 2015 converges yeah but

00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:59,800
years ago I am when we first went all-in

00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:03,369
and Linux little pencil company called

00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:09,640
scope came around and they decided to go

00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:11,140
after because they and that there were

00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,180
companies out there commercial life

00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,490
Linux without the right they didn't have

00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,890
a permission to use their code and they

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,349
went trans doing all the my customers

00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:23,680
and maintain every other vendor that was

00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:25,780
something Linux based products and when

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,849
that clock is it as a youngster looking

00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:30,330
at look it's worth doing it right Wyatt

00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:33,180
legs foundation is so important is

00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:35,530
simple things like the day after

00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,260
everyone and I am and everyone an

00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:41,109
open-source knew what a certificate of

00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,359
originality is that you needed what

00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:46,420
you've had a project needed Providence

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,000
that showed who contributed to this code

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,890
base and that they had read to like to

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,740
license a few you know this is one of

00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:56,290
the reasons why my name is very strict

00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:58,480
rules like main company do about what

00:36:56,290 --> 00:37:00,940
projects and how we participated over

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,550
the first and what we don't write it was

00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:06,460
a really rumbly morning that Monday

00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:09,860
morning when we got we're not customers

00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:12,860
that they are hundreds of millions of

00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:15,020
dollars do is practical so let this

00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,990
destined to think of a pathway but

00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,760
governance tonight learns over this now

00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:22,850
it's all a little more just and more

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,920
than just yeah it's a highly diverse

00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:26,030
group of different projects that don't

00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,820
have to work together

00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:31,520
yeah these right away I think this

00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,440
notion is this hotline pressure that the

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:41,780
government's and similar than the

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:46,460
licenses the statistician but then you

00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:48,770
know sitting around and good technical

00:37:46,460 --> 00:38:00,230
people find you know they kind of see

00:37:48,770 --> 00:38:02,450
each other in October bleeding a lot

00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:04,490
over trying to get you know different

00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:08,090
dude for every diversity Bruce Lee in

00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:12,020
tell us what they bounce idea and our

00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:14,030
three sort of advanced analysis even to

00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,920
the mothers in like a company's purpose

00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:19,040
in the open source world like high-end

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,290
purpose ultimately is we provide

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,880
commercial offers you know white bread

00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:28,010
back like many other companies and we

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,530
provide commercial operative a resource

00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:33,410
and as a buyer when you buy that open

00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:41,540
source based product you're getting

00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:44,950
guaranteed was lovable if you purchase

00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:47,690
that product onto someone maybe SP

00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,770
remainders to that so so having that

00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,770
level playing field

00:38:52,900 --> 00:39:00,700
using basic we see some of the best

00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:05,430
technology built out of for watching

00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:31,660
years of being that excellence we are

00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:34,060
anonymous we have foundation so late

00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:42,190
already in terms of collaborative

00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:44,110
projects I guess some were extremely

00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:48,790
excited about this next chapter of

00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:51,670
convergence light IBM and the fabric

00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:55,090
technology we've been building private

00:39:51,670 --> 00:40:01,000
permission systems for quite a few years

00:39:55,090 --> 00:40:03,640
now with the technology transaction we

00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,810
put scalability and permissioning

00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:13,420
systems and you are now I think seeing

00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:16,420
the technology matures it at least so

00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:18,490
that we can see a rough sketch of what

00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,260
the decentralized world wide web is

00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,900
going to look like him and that's going

00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,540
to be essentially a patchwork of

00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:28,650
different block chain systems or DLT

00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:32,740
systems that link to one another

00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:38,340
laterally as as our otaku economy trade

00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:42,240
clients platforms linking to the evac'd

00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,240
trading platform and

00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:51,859
projects and girth down into the

00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:54,980
etherion base trust layer so we'll see

00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:56,839
the theorem projects were the same

00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,990
technology projects whether separate

00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:03,230
Network Center down into the thing that

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:08,170
was here and we're seeing projects like

00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:13,279
Bitcoin in dogecoin and ideally fabric

00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:17,710
also take advantage of lateral

00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:22,160
connections were anchoring down and the

00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:23,990
submitting our or their clients to the

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,349
regulative Foundation and has just

00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:32,779
kicked off whirlwind of excitement and

00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:35,930
activity is and we could have done a

00:41:32,779 --> 00:41:38,630
bunch of collaborating and and fortunate

00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,940
lives between our projects and our

00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,730
networks without being part of the

00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:46,460
hydrologic foundation that effectives

00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:49,910
were all now officially part of the same

00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:56,480
family and liability foundation is very

00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:59,599
focused but not being a so two of side

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,539
would be projects but the people within

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,650
hydrogen work really really hard on on

00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:08,510
taking pieces of projects and if they're

00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:11,150
add the two of the two other projects

00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,190
and streamline things and essentially

00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:16,549
coordinating for operations so yeah I

00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:20,270
feel like the decentralized world wide

00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:23,720
web is now starting to be architected

00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:27,319
under the yeah

00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:31,220
and welcome and thank you for joining

00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:33,349
I do think one of the things about the

00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,569
success that we've had with hyperbola

00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:37,400
through these networks and one thing I

00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:39,829
can say for sure every single one of

00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:45,740
those networks has some form of digital

00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:48,619
asset inside and I also say hundred

00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:51,980
percent to work that those digital

00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:54,619
assets are somewhat native to that

00:42:51,980 --> 00:43:00,560
network would be very difficult to

00:42:54,619 --> 00:43:03,530
express a standard and I think one of

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:08,569
the things that excites me about the

00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:13,000
etherium project Basin coming in is the

00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:17,300
ability to connect to the urgent network

00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,520
with your client we have the means to

00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,369
start integrating those digital assets

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,790
from those couple of networks as much as

00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:27,970
velocity versus time education I can say

00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:31,280
it is all of those things to have me

00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:33,650
Jodie's the turkey interoperate and you

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,770
know so I do believe this next phase of

00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:38,990
liberation entertaining those custom

00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:41,000
networks being able to express the

00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:44,000
digital assets in ways that other

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,210
networks could appreciate and that

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,180
reason about and this will bring a whole

00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:54,829
new me this be many people called

00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:57,230
watching fueling web 302 centralized web

00:43:54,829 --> 00:44:00,890
and the interesting thing about going

00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:03,990
from web one to

00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:07,740
so in order to be the best of everybody

00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:12,450
at least your webtoon and the beautiful

00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:14,480
part about web 2 is api's being able to

00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:17,190
discover like the programmable web

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,770
capabilities out there and I think that

00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:22,890
the abilities these platforms for

00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:26,130
digital asset exchange we need at least

00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:28,140
to be able to bring what web to mobile

00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,940
for example you build a mobile app

00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,829
you're gonna be using them duck doesn't

00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,380
third-party ad guys and you're going to

00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:37,230
go level APIs imagine what is the web

00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,510
real good or bad right it has to be

00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,550
speed event stuff where they've got one

00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,250
of those eccentric alive avionics that

00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:46,849
are going to allow things to talk about

00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:49,380
a pub and security common identity

00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:51,180
commented on innovation and exchange I

00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:58,790
think this is where we're going and

00:44:51,180 --> 00:45:03,680
going toward his head is well I think

00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:03,680
that's a great way to start to end this

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,900
beginning I work for both of these guys

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:17,309
one time to another and as nice to see

00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:20,250
things coming circle circle in but this

00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:22,799
specific wasn't just a 2015 t.r you

00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:28,980
hired me in 2013 safety for my master

00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:33,829
and later and and in that you might be

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:36,720
not only API companies yeah well and I

00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:38,549
think what I've been pasted to steal a

00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:43,290
lot of the submit mation schema-less

00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:45,059
for years is is the convergence required

00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:47,400
to get identity when he came to mind

00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:49,100
under the purchase period because the

00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,770
mark standards requires

00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,720
to make working at identity now maybe

00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:56,450
we're going to guest this is the

00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,290
statement of a staple internet they can

00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:01,240
really do

00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:05,810
turn off the API Khamenei ways that we

00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:08,750
so I think we'll give you the last word

00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:31,040
on this what are your thoughts on this

00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:36,590
this emergence would you like this point

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:44,600
of time to change what we don't like so

00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:47,840
much from exploitative of human beings

00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:51,790
and perhaps of all that good for us as

00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:59,440
Diane societies and nation states

00:46:51,790 --> 00:47:03,440
because have been exploited the their

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:08,060
personal information and their attention

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:10,350
is hijacked by organizations that sell

00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:14,660
their response permission and

00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:17,670
don't remember dates of those people and

00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:21,270
through this work in Cambridge a

00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:24,450
political activities like that web to in

00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:28,740
some cases has become a weapon of ask

00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:32,790
manipulation so there's so much of what

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:36,540
to that we love and need but they're

00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:41,730
pieces that have grown somewhat

00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:45,420
cancerous I think it's so taking the

00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:47,340
best of two and having decentralized

00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:50,520
government systems have a decentralized

00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:54,060
identity systems where we are in control

00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:55,500
of the root of our activity in the

00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:59,610
important people to have much greater

00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:01,380
agency financial agency controlling

00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:03,720
their assets more directly or

00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,180
participating in collaboration networks

00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,550
that are facilitated by this new

00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:12,180
collaboration technology that is about

00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:18,590
Janet I think that's a double start

00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:22,620
early hints at the profound change that

00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:30,470
we can expect the web through technology

00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:33,660
is the EEA Enterprise of their alliances

00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:36,950
focusing on enterprise use of this their

00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:39,740
technology units increasingly focused on

00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:44,250
the maintenance determinant as

00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:47,310
enterprises major financial institutions

00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:50,670
etc are starting to build up to

00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:56,480
contemplate America's cases on public

00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:58,770
payment and dive religion foundation is

00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:03,050
one of the places where a lot of that

00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:07,970
software is written for enterprises

00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:10,640
so I really think the the barriers have

00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:16,910
almost fallen completely at this

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:20,330
plankton it's it's straight shot two

00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:22,600
words working together and building

00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:25,790
about they all want to see get it built

00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:28,420
well I've been looking forward to this

00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:32,960
for a long time was very excited and

00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:37,190
grateful both of you for doing this Joe

00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:40,370
and history where are you somewhere else

00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:44,440
apparently animation animation so school

00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:44,820
tonight they're so rotten

00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,919
[Applause]

00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,919
