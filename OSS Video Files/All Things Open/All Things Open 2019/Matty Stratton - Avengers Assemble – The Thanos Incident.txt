Title: Matty Stratton - Avengers Assemble – The Thanos Incident
Publication date: 2019-11-04
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Over the course of the Avengers storyline, everything has been leading up to the ultimate outage—when Thanos snapped his fingers, eliminating half of all life in the universe.

Come along with me on a journey to perform a retrospective on this greatest of all incidents in the Marvel universe. What were the contributing factors? How could the Avengers have followed better incident response procedures? And can this be reviewed in a truly blameless fashion?

In this talk, I will revisit the storyline across the Marvel Cinematic Universe that led up to a critical event: the “Snap,” when Thanos removes half of all life in the universe at the end of Avengers: Infinity War, as well as the resolution displayed in Avengers: Endgame. We will explore the activities of the incident response teams (the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and more), to discover what they did well, what they could have done better, and why S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to invest in better Incident Response training.

The audience will learn how to engage in productive Incident Response practices, conduct blameless postmortems, and even why a properly used pager (ala Captain Marvel) can be a key element in successfully navigating even the most dire of universal crises.

[Music]

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:10,679
so my name is Maddy Stratton for a

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,969
second I thought there was something

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,880
wrong with a slide the Wain overhead was

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,880
like what was happened but no um so I'm

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,170
a DevOps advocate at pager duty how many

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,930
people here have heard of pager duty

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,029
great awesome I mentioned pager duty so

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,010
now I fulfilled my obligation to my

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,529
employer uh-huh

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,920
how many people here are currently on

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,510
call or in an on-call rotation okay cool

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,309
if you are currently on call right now

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,610
you do not need to silence your devices

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,820
we have empathy for you I am also a

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,829
Marvel fan boy I like Batman that's

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,379
about as far in DC as I go but I love

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:50,640
Marvel and you can find me on twitter at

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:55,170
matt stratton so a couple things to

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,930
think about be advised this talk i say

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,550
may contain spoilers i should say will

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,949
contain spoilers for basically

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,040
potentially almost anything in the

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:07,140
Marvel Cinematic Universe but especially

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,549
infinity war an end game so if you

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,770
haven't seen those movies and you don't

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,939
want to be spoiled I'm not gonna tell

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,950
you to leave because I want you all to

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,070
stay but you have been warned also I

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,680
feel like this statute is expired on

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,720
those things and you know you came to a

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,860
talk called the Thanos incident I think

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,909
you know what you're getting yourself

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:31,020
into right so and yeah references will

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,700
abound I I try to make my talks as

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,299
inclusive as possible but everybody has

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:40,079
opted in to hear a talk about the

00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:42,119
Avengers so let's kind of think about

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,290
this like what happened we want to talk

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,509
we're gonna sit here we're gonna talk

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,299
about Incident Response and we're gonna

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,549
talk about a specific incident and the

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,590
incident is what we and what has been

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,750
called the snap right this is when

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,180
Thanos snapped his fingers wiped out

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,680
half of life in the universe I don't

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,780
know how many P once you've been on but

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,719
this one seems like a pretty big one

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,360
right so we're gonna step through a

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,420
couple things so first of all we're

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,310
going to consider what we're gonna

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,379
create a post-mortem of the incident

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,890
we're gonna think about what occurred

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,170
right

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,600
and our approach will be to address this

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,220
in a blameless fashion so we're gonna

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,900
talk about how we approach this in a

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,620
blameless way we're gonna see why the

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,810
Avengers

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,860
spoiler alert upon spoiler alert are

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,530
terrible at that

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,050
and what we really want to understand

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,210
what happened as well as the process the

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,550
Avengers used so a lot of times when we

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,290
do a post-mortem or a post Instant

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,330
review we're gonna think about the

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,490
specific technologies the specific

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,920
things in our system but we also think

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,990
about our process in this case we're

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,090
gonna focus a lot more on the process

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,630
because the Avengers don't use

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,450
kubernetes and for purposes of this

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,250
discussion the Avengers will refer not

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,320
only to the team usually referred to as

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,600
the Avengers but maybe other heroes

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,310
within the Marvel Cinematic Universe who

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,900
are generally not considered Avengers

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,239
but maybe sometimes they are sometimes

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,550
they aren't so bear with me you don't

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,670
need to explain how wrong I am when I

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:14,940
call Peter quill and Avenger

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,320
alright so granted we're gonna talk

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,030
about timelines right we're gonna

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,730
construct a timeline this is the first

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,140
thing we do when we are creating and

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,459
we're working on a post-mortem and I

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,489
actually want to make a quick statement

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,920
here again just like I'm using the term

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,480
Avengers to kind of encompass maybe some

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,760
folks who are not technically considered

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,040
Avengers there's a lot of different

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,750
terms we use for in our post-incident

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,970
reviews we might call them a post

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,410
incident review we might call them a

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,330
post mortem we might call it an

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,850
after-action report we might call it a

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,560
learning review for sake of simplicity

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,290
I'm gonna continue to use the term

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,840
post-mortem but substitute in whatever

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,720
your organization uses so one of the

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,000
first things we do when we want to do

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,790
analysis on an incident as we need to

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,560
construct a timeline so we're gonna go

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,080
along this and granted when we talk

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,340
about timelines in this case it gets a

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,040
little squirrely because there's

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,260
time-travel involved but that's not what

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,329
I mean by timelines and generally

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,160
speaking in the post-mortems you do in

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,769
your organization you're not creating

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,650
alternate timelines when you're having a

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,720
problem with terraform mostly right

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,580
maybe just branches so maybe feature

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,349
branches or like timelines or some

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,630
branching but that metaphor falls apart

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:29,360
pretty quickly so the thing

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,060
remember is when we create a timeline

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,900
we're not really ready to start analysis

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:40,110
at this point right and we want to avoid

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,330
hindsight bias so we're gonna start our

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,000
timeline at a point before the incident

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,760
began and work our way forward instead

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,580
of backward right so when you're

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,890
creating a timeline you want to stick to

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,770
the facts right we're again we're not

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,780
starting analysis yet we're constructing

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,480
a what happened so it should be

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,430
fact-based it should be based upon data

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,560
that we might have from maybe our

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,230
monitoring systems maybe from the chats

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,990
logs that occurred during our incident

00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:12,990
call we want to include key decisions

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,670
and actions taken by responders so not

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,010
only is it things we did but what were

00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,480
decisions what things happened and it

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,010
doesn't mean every single thing that

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,580
someone did but what we're kind of the

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,470
key points and we want to avoid at this

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,810
point evaluating what should or

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,730
shouldn't have been done we're trying to

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,030
get the information so that we can then

00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:35,550
do our analysis and again as I said we

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,490
start our time late at a point before

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:40,650
the incident began to avoid hindsight

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,530
bias I'm gonna talk about biases and

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,210
cognitive distortions in a little bit

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,480
but a lot of times the incident usually

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,790
began before responders were aware of it

00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,130
so what we want to do is we want to sort

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,840
of start our timeline before we became

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,730
aware of it as much as we understand

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,560
because that helps eliminate that

00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:04,530
hindsight bias so what's the high level

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,820
timeline of the thanos incident right

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,270
we're gonna kind of step through and

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,380
again this is the high level timeline

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,390
going through the actual complete

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,610
timeline would probably take the full 45

00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,820
minutes so if you wanted a recap of the

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,890
entire Avengers MCU that's a different

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,600
talk right so we kind of started Thanos

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,790
gets the Power Stone in the space stone

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,950
in various ways right that's a thing

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,870
that happens then you got Thor and the

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,550
guardians of the galaxy they decide to

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,900
split up so this is a decision that was

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,750
made Thor

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,880
decides to go and get himself a

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,260
replacement from the earlier and then

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,479
the rest had to know where because

00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,950
they're gonna try to intercept Thanos so

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,250
a decision was made at this

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:46,440
point right and then however a thing

00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,780
happens Thanos gets the reality stone

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,060
from the collector on nowhere that's and

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,690
that is a thing that occurs in our

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,880
timeline a decision an action is taken

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,010
by responders dr. strange uses the time

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,560
stone to view millions of possible

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,860
futures this would be really useful like

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,520
during a real instant wouldn't it but

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,060
unfortunately we don't have this

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,460
available to us and then Fano sacrifices

00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,860
Gamora under warm air to obtain the soul

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,110
stone then we have several team members

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,290
attempt to recover the Infinity Gauntlet

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,090
from Thanos on Titan these are actions

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,220
are taken by responders they're trying

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,970
to at this point fundamentally restore

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,860
service best way they know how

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:31,020
Doctor Strange an action a decision is

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,960
made by a responder he decides to

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:37,620
exchange the time stone in exchange for

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,810
Tony Stark's life sharee is now taking

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,640
action to try to remove the mind stone

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,190
from vision so that it can be destroyed

00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,800
we have various team members various

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,110
responders are attempting to defend

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,540
vision while their other team member is

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,540
working to restore service so we're

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,980
working together but actions are taken

00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,710
Thanos obtains the mind stone from

00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,980
vision for attacks Thanos but is unable

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,410
to defeat him and then finally what we

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,970
recognize is the actual incident what

00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,610
occurs is that oh snaps his finger

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,520
wiping out half of all life no big deal

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,990
right some additional items happened in

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,970
here but we're not going to dig into all

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:20,280
of it right now so now that we have a

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:23,670
timeline we can start to analyze our

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,350
incident by the way thanks to Ty Bob and

00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,720
Ryan kitchens from Netflix for both

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,050
being influences on the idea of Groot

00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,110
cause analysis that was amazing timing

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,729
but we're gonna dig into what we can

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,380
learn from this now we've constructed

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:39,060
our timeline so when we think about this

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,070
in course of an incident that's

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,900
occurring within our organization we

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,700
start by creating that timeline and

00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:50,250
understanding of what happened and then

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:53,190
we can begin our analysis here's the

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,760
thing right systems are complex there's

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,100
a lot going on

00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,400
and we just had a really funny slide

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,610
that implied you know made a reference

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,260
to the term root cause analysis this is

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,570
probably going to be the last time you

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,170
ever hear me endorse the word or the

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:13,840
phrase root cause so here's the thing

00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,760
right there is no single root cause of

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,580
failure in complex systems it's a

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,260
combination of contributing factors

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:24,160
right we always want to remind ourselves

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:26,050
there is no root cause and our goal in

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,110
analyzing the incident is not to

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,870
identify this smoking gun this root

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,150
cause this thing that is why it happened

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,580
we want to understand the multiple

00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:40,480
factors that created an environment

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,650
where this failure became possible so if

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,110
you learn nothing else from this talk

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,690
it's to maybe start using the term

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,520
contributing factors when we think about

00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,860
this and the reason that root cause can

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:54,400
be dangerous to think about is because

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:57,430
we will identify a root cause we want to

00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,490
our brains want us to do that our bosses

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,320
want us to do that and but then we stop

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,910
we're like well it must have pinned this

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,650
and I will tell you something so I

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,660
usually tell when a lot of my talks when

00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,840
I talk about root cause and contributing

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:14,020
factors I make the comment that the only

00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,910
root cause is the big bang in the case

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,220
of the MCU that is actually literally

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,870
true because that's when the Infinity

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,250
stones were created and if there was no

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,630
Big Bang there would be no infinity

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,840
stone so therefore there's our root

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,460
cause is that helpful for us to know

00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,230
absolutely not we want to think about

00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,270
what we're all the contributing factors

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,290
that occurred that got us to this point

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:37,510
that there was failure in our team's

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,330
ability to provide incident response

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,630
right so we're gonna take a little time

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:45,700
to talk about being blameless how many

00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,230
people have heard about blameless

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,180
post-mortems before the idea of

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,740
blameless this great so we're gonna talk

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,030
about why it's important but even more

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,790
than that we're gonna talk about why

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,890
it's hard and we're not just gonna sit

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,580
down and say well we should do that but

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,310
it's hard

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,830
oh no we're actually talk about how to

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:05,800
be able to counter these things right

00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:08,920
so when we think about this why does it

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,650
matter right so first of all this

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,020
impulse to blame really has this

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:16,870
unintended effect of it creates this

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,690
disabilities this situation where we

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,360
don't share knowledge right

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,310
a couple pithy quotes to think about

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,950
number one right you can't fire your way

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,140
to reliability and I always like to say

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,020
that if people are afraid of being

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,770
blamed for making mistakes that is not

00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:38,560
going to cause them to create fewer

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,630
mistakes it actually causes them to

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,150
become subject matter experts in hiding

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:45,520
their mistakes people don't speak up in

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,950
a culture of blame and then you have

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,360
even less insight into things that are

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,390
going on in your system and in your

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,060
organization so the goal of the

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:58,210
post-mortem right is to understand what

00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,850
systemic failures you know led to the

00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,610
incident and also let's identify actions

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,950
that can help improve the resiliency of

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,290
our systems you'll notice I didn't say

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,380
identify actions that can prevent this

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:13,900
from occurring again this is my little

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,270
pro tip to you to start getting the word

00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,770
prevent out of your out of your language

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,290
when you're working with your team's

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,060
because you don't want your big bosses

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,040
to hear the idea that you're trying to

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,130
prevent things because guess what

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,200
happens if it happens again I thought

00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,880
you said you were going to prevent it we

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,890
might not be able to prevent them from

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,890
occurring but we can mitigate the impact

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:39,310
and we can create more resilient systems

00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:42,190
keep this in mind in today's systems

00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:46,240
they are always in some state of failure

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:49,210
or degradation right dr. Richard Cooke

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,680
has said right it's not the fact that

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,600
you know we shouldn't sit there and say

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,520
like it'sit's amazing that we have

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,490
failures it's amazing that our systems

00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,740
work at all right so we're always going

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,590
to have some type of degradation we want

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,240
to build adaptive capacity into our

00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,670
systems and our systems include our

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,520
technical systems as well as the people

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:13,240
who operate and deploy them so that when

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,580
these systemic things happen our systems

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,480
and our people are able to adapt and

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:22,560
minimize the impact of these failures

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,800
and we want to stay focused on how

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,810
a mistake was made not on who did it it

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:32,910
does not fundamentally help us to know

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:34,620
who did if you go back to the the idea

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,250
is so Sidney Dekker wrote a great book

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,779
called about human error and he talks

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,940
about there's two different models of

00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,800
human error there's kind of the older

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,260
model which is the idea that there are

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,050
bad actors people who are bad at their

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,300
job who are causing problems because of

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,670
fundamental character flaws in them and

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,990
then the newer way to think about it is

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,279
again we're not thinking about bad

00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,990
actors we're thinking about what

00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,970
happened in the system where any

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,790
reasonable person might have made the

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,839
same mistake and what are the systemic

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:09,180
factors that allowed that to happen so

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,710
why is it hard right like we kind of at

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,600
this point I mean whether you know

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,520
DevOps is like 10 years old like John

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,740
auspi wrote about blameless post-mortems

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,630
like seven years ago like we get it that

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,940
this matters so we should be able to

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,580
just say let's all go be blameless now

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,940
right we know that blaming sucks why is

00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:29,580
it hard so the first thing is that when

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,180
we're trying to compensate for failure

00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,980
the human mind takes shortcuts and this

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,960
is intuition this is usually an

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,180
advantage this is our prefrontal cortex

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,550
being able to make these intuitive leaps

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,500
but these shortcuts can be damaging

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,920
right and this is another thing to think

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,860
about

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,100
we are hardwired from millions of years

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,780
of evolution to want to blame and this

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,490
is why Jay Paul Reid says blamelessness

00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,640
is something you cannot achieve we

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:59,430
should instead be blame aware we cannot

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,500
change our neuropsychological evolution

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,510
these are the tendencies that we have as

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,420
human beings but when we're aware of

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,190
them we're able to do something about it

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,800
and the human mind optimizes for

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:14,040
timeliness over accuracy when processing

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:18,000
failure and this can lead to cognitive

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,470
biases so let's take a minute to talk

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,070
about what some of those cognitive

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:26,160
biases are right so we're gonna go into

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,290
them in depth here but if we're aware of

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,540
these biases we can identify when they

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,000
occur and we can work to move past them

00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,040
so they're basically fundamentally no

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,940
pun intended fundamental attribution

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,300
error

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,940
confirmation bias hindsight bias and

00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,130
negativity bias there are a lot more

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,140
cognitive distortions and more biases

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:49,530
but these are the four that tend to lead

00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,840
us in a path of blame so listen about

00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,610
fundamental attribution error this is

00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,790
the tendency to believe that what people

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:59,580
do reflects their character rather than

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,320
their circumstances this describes that

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,080
old view of human error that Dekker

00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,910
talks about which assigns responsibility

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,060
to bad actors who are careless and

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:12,150
incompetent ironically we tend to

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:15,600
explain our actions our own actions by

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:17,670
context not our personality unless we're

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,170
one de Wanda takes it on herself so this

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,720
is fundamental attribution error to

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,570
herself that occurred after Civil War or

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,710
during Civil War so how do you combat

00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:30,410
this fundamental attribution error we

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:33,570
focus instead our analysis on

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:36,780
situational causes rather than discrete

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:39,030
actions that individuals took this can

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,770
be really really challenging when

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,960
working with more senior people in your

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:45,240
organization who are not aware of the

00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:49,020
damaging things that blame can cause

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,420
people at senior levels tend to want

00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,940
someone to fire they want someone to

00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,350
blame and that's because to get to a

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,210
senior level you've probably been

00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,130
working in this industry for a long time

00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:02,250
and for a long time we've subscribed to

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,960
the old view of human error so

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,300
confirmation bias this is pretty

00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,520
pervasive and this is a tendency to

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,070
favor information that reinforces our

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,960
existing beliefs so when we're presented

00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:15,930
with ambiguous information which tracks

00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,490
cannot handle we tend to interpret in a

00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,190
way that supports our existing

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,200
assumptions so when we combat that with

00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:25,860
that old view of human error it's

00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,630
dangerous for post-mortems because if we

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,330
want to find a bad apple we will find

00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,120
one right if our eye our confirmation

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:35,700
bias is that failure occurs because of

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,940
human error we will find someone we will

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,980
blame them for it right so Lindsey home

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,220
would suggest that if we want to avoid

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,870
combination by a confirmation bias you

00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,490
can appoint someone in your analysis to

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,990
play devil's advocate to take these

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,800
contrarian view points during

00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,840
investigation

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,670
but you have to be cautious to not

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,910
introduce negativity or combativeness

00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,770
when you're playing devil's advocate

00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,930
another way is to invite someone from

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,730
another team to ask any and all

00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,500
questions that come to their mind

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,850
because those of us that we've been

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,430
supporting we've been working for a

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,110
system for a long time we tend to find

00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,600
things that support what we believe

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:16,170
based on our experience this is also why

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,240
junior engineers are fantastic people to

00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,790
include in your post incident review

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,990
because they will ask questions that

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,640
those of us that have been doing this

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,980
for a long time it would never occur to

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,340
us to ask and we'll continue to go down

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,170
the same path hindsight bias comes up a

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,230
lot this is a memory distortion where we

00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:36,300
recall events to form a judgment so if

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,310
we know the outcome it's really easy to

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,260
see the event as having been predictable

00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,720
well of course we would should have seen

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,460
this coming despite the fact that there

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,280
was little or no objective basis for

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,890
predicting it again most of our teams do

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,100
not have the time stone we actually

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,660
cannot tell the future an example is

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,880
when a person who's analyzing the

00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,620
incident believes they knew it would

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,050
happen like that right if someone had

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,120
only involved me I could have told them

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,010
that this scaling issue would have come

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,010
up this was uh this should have been

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,590
clear why was this not seen hindsight

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,150
bias tends to also come up with folks at

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,470
a more senior level which is why could

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,140
this not have been seen this seems so

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,660
obvious right and a way to avoid this is

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,630
just like we talked about earlier start

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,120
your analysis at the beginning before

00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:26,580
the incident and move forward we tend to

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,710
want to move backwards we tend to say it

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,050
started here now let's start to build

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,200
our timeline backwards and that will

00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:36,750
lead us down the path of hindsight bias

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,390
and then finally we talk about

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,520
negativity bias this is the notion that

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,800
things of a more negative nature have a

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,840
greater effect on our mental state than

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,050
those of neutral or even positive nature

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,390
and research has shown that negative

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,610
information disproportionately impacts a

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,320
person impression of others right again

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,260
this relates to the bad apple theory we

00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,850
tend to believe negative information we

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,000
hear about people or that we witness

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,450
versus is positive and people are more

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,130
likely

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,750
a tribute negative outcomes of the

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,970
intentions of another person then

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,160
neutral or positive the reality is

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,800
things go right more often than they go

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,620
wrong but we tend to focus and magnify

00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,710
on the importance of negative events so

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,780
if we focus and exaggerate internalizing

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,770
events as negative events and since as

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,780
negative events

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,300
that's demoralizing it can lead to

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,400
burnout we want to reframe incidents as

00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,660
learning opportunities another way to

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,210
think about this and this might be a

00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,070
stretch as incidents are a gift right

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,320
incidents are a way of our systems

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:40,350
telling us something we didn't know

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,030
before you can also help counter

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,280
negativity bias when you're doing your

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,590
post incident analysis by not just

00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,230
focusing on what went wrong ask

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,870
questions about what went right maybe

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,220
even where did we get lucky those are

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:57,120
important things and they're important

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:59,460
factors so how do we avoid blame how do

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,870
we practically deal with this stuff

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,590
right so there's a couple really key

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:07,020
ones ask what and how questions instead

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,550
of who or why this is the slide when

00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,190
everybody says but what about the five

00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:13,260
why's and instead I would point you to

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,780
an article John auspi wrote called the

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,370
infinite house and I will give a link at

00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,960
the end of this presentation that's got

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,000
all the resources all the articles I'm

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,580
talking about but if we ask how

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,770
questions instead of why this gets

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,930
people to describe at least some of the

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,600
conditions that allowed an event to take

00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:33,330
place Lindsey Homewood also clarify

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,150
notes at how questions help clarify

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,910
technical details and it distances

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,520
people from the actions that they took

00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:44,760
when we asked why questions this tends

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,370
to create a need for defensiveness right

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,900
I have to explain my behavior why

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,580
questions even if it's not in post

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,340
incident review when I'm helping

00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,390
organizations change oftentimes the

00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,920
first thing is like well let me explain

00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,200
to you why we're doing things the way we

00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,940
did I'm like I believe you if you had

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,550
all the information you had we're moving

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,350
forward why questions tend to put people

00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,610
on their heels and make them feel like

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,350
they have to justify their behavior

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,200
because fundamentally that is what

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,520
you're asking them to do we want to

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,830
consider multiple and diverse

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,200
perspectives so I talked about this a

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,190
little bit about bringing in people from

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,929
another team

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,519
when you're doing your post incident

00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:22,619
analysis it's not just about the

00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,179
engineers who worked on that there may

00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:26,190
be your incident command or maybe the

00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,239
scribe maybe the comms person there are

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,249
a lot of different people who were

00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:30,450
involved in the incident that may have

00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:32,609
different perspectives and asked

00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,669
questions that might not occur to you

00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:38,820
and here's the thing you want to ask

00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:40,769
yourself you know why a reasonable

00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,349
competent and decent person would have

00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:45,419
taken those actions right because what

00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:48,059
this is happening is because when we're

00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,639
analyzing failure we fall into victim

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,710
villain and helplessness stories that

00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:55,590
propel emotions and attempt to justify

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,389
our worst behavior so we can move by

00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,700
this bye-bye behind this body telling

00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:01,979
the rest of the story right consider

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,229
your and others roles in the problem ask

00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:05,700
yourself if you don't understand you

00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:07,919
know what could be the factors that

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,229
would lead a reasonable rational and

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,239
decent person to take that action that

00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:14,940
caught that that related in the incident

00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:18,059
right this helps turn attention to the

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:21,269
systemic factors that led to the

00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:24,359
incident and you know we want to

00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:26,820
abstract to an in specific responder so

00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:29,070
this one is hard right but I'm really

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,129
really a big fan of this right so when

00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,979
we're inquiring about a human action we

00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:36,539
want to abstract to the in specific

00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:39,210
anyone could have made that same mistake

00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:41,879
so I am a big believer of not using

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,460
names in post-mortems especially not in

00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:46,470
post-mortem documents you may be able to

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,970
have a conversation about it now the

00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,799
problem with abstracting to an in

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,080
specific responder where this gets

00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:54,960
actually really hard is when you want to

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,090
say something positive right because but

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,919
you need to keep with that so what this

00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,809
means we can still talk about roles but

00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,840
instead of talking about Ken I'm gonna

00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,639
say the senior sre and even when you get

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,889
to an organization that is good at

00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:09,029
blamelessness you may feel like you can

00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:11,369
actually do this and this actually

00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:12,929
happened inside our organization we have

00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:14,999
some folks started you know brought up

00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:16,710
and said hey I noticed that someone's

00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,909
name was in this post mortem document I

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,639
thought we don't do that

00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:22,470
and another responder said well actually

00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:24,690
we're really good at blamelessness at

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,210
pager duty so we can get away with it

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,729
and that person was not necessarily

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,870
wrong but the reminder is while the

00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,370
people there right now

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,050
might be good at that you are constantly

00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,120
bringing new people into the

00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,309
organization who have to learn by

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,860
example the other reason and maybe this

00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:43,970
is purely selfish while maybe you might

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:47,190
be able to use names in a conversation

00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,450
documents are searchable and the last

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,160
thing you want is somebody searching

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:52,950
post-incident reviews at the time of

00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,390
somebody's annual review and then who

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:58,470
doesn't understand the concepts of

00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:01,260
blamelessness so and again contrast what

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:03,240
you did not intend with what you did so

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,490
even when you make your best effort to

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,960
remain blameless it's possible that

00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,580
someone may still become defensive

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,559
during a post-mortem meeting if they

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,880
feel that they're being blamed so when

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,760
this happens we want to work to restore

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,920
mutual purpose and mutual respect so we

00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,260
can continue the conversation it's not

00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,179
productive to have people people feel

00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,370
defensive it's okay to feel defensive by

00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,200
the way and the way that we do this is

00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,840
reiterate that the goal is to understand

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,580
systemic factors right people act out

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,830
defensively when they when they feel

00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,650
that their character is being attacked

00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:36,300
so we can contrast this by saying I did

00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,400
not mean to imply that you're bad at

00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,679
your job contrasted with what you did

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,900
intend which was I wanted to inquire I

00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,600
wanted to ask about what was the

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,320
situation what was happening how did

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,660
this happen

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,270
right we're refocusing our question away

00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:54,900
from individual motivation because that

00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:57,420
implies blame also by abstracting to the

00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,640
in specific responder this encourages

00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:03,000
other responders to be more active in

00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,160
contributing suggestions as to what

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,410
could have also contributed because we

00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,900
also generally don't want to blame our

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:12,150
co-workers we like our co-workers so it

00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,120
could be challenging right so here's the

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:17,970
thing right all practitioner actions are

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,559
Gamble's right that is we don't we know

00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,340
again we don't have the time stone right

00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:24,900
there axe to take place in the face of

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,940
uncertain outcomes and the person who

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,660
said this is dr. Richard Cook of

00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,670
adaptive capacity labs now and another

00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,010
way to put that to bring this back is

00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:37,470
this comment here which is you never

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,480
know you hope for the best and you make

00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,910
through with what you got and that was

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,380
said by Nick Fury right so you can

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,909
either listen to dr. cook or you can

00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,739
listen to fury they're both

00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:48,929
fundamentally saying the same thing we

00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:50,940
don't know what's going to happen so

00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:53,970
remember that that individual actions

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:57,379
are always Gamble's based upon what we

00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:00,720
knew at the time so what can we learn

00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:03,359
what can we learn from the Avengers and

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,159
how they responded to Thanos so one

00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:08,999
thing and I talked about this a little

00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:13,649
bit blame happens a lot on this team

00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:16,349
they love to blame Tony loves to blame

00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:19,379
Steve Rogers for almost everything

00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:21,840
somehow right this is always a challenge

00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:25,139
at the beginning of endgame right it was

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:29,399
you weren't there you let me down it was

00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:31,710
about caps character it wasn't about why

00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:35,159
did this how did this happen it was

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,809
about the individual right so we're

00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,479
gonna focus on the incident response

00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:42,599
process of the team again this is not

00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:44,669
about prevention and not to pick on Tony

00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:47,429
Stark but here's another place he kind

00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:50,340
of messes it up Tony is all about the

00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:52,409
idea of being able to prevent right he

00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:55,369
literally wants to build a suit of armor

00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:59,220
around the world to keep systems

00:27:55,369 --> 00:28:01,859
humanity from failing if we try to

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,159
address our systemic issues this way

00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:06,570
which is if we just built enough

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,960
technology we could have a hundred

00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,609
percent uptime you can't right and the

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,070
thing is so weak and we can't prevent

00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:18,929
Thanos but we can learn how to get

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:20,159
better at responding to incidents so we

00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:22,349
want to think about the idea of having

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,479
an incident commander during an incident

00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:26,580
response process this is really critical

00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:28,619
right so when the Avengers work well

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,570
together they generally have someone

00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:32,159
calling the shots right so we think

00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,379
about the Battle of New York cap was

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,049
kind of in charge things work generally

00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:40,440
well and it does seem like cap tends to

00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:43,409
be the most likely person he takes that

00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,929
leadership role but B he's also a

00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:47,609
responder he's someone who fights the

00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:50,909
villains who fights the baddies right

00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:53,759
and that can be a problem because not to

00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:56,940
mix up our pop culture references but as

00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,590
Ron Swanson would say never half-ass two

00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,289
jobs whole last one

00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:04,700
job you can't be an incident commander

00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:07,049
and a responder at the same time and

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,700
when we talk about we talk a little bit

00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,710
about what the incident commander does

00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,779
so the first thing to bear in mind is

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,350
the incident command incident commander

00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:19,110
is a role it's not necessarily someone's

00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:21,059
job you may have people who have a title

00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,250
of incident manager or something like

00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,659
that but we're not talking about where

00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,150
you fall in the org chart we're actually

00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:29,279
talking about a role you take during an

00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,480
incident and it's the roll is called

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,789
incident commander

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,730
so incident commanders main role during

00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:37,260
an incident is to delegate and

00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,690
coordinate right so they are sitting

00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,149
there and helping get the right people

00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:45,539
the subject matter experts the folks who

00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:48,090
know how to help resolve that issue and

00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:49,350
restore service to enable them to do

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,690
that and also to help collect

00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:54,539
information so they delegate and they

00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:57,149
coordinate right they're also a

00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,610
decision-maker and this sometimes gets a

00:29:57,149 --> 00:30:01,529
little bit tricky so the thing is nobody

00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,840
should take any action on an incident

00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:06,419
unless the incident commander has said

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,610
so and this gets really really tricky

00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:09,990
when we go to the next part about being

00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:13,770
an incident commander which is they are

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:16,559
the single source of truth on an

00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:19,610
incident call and the incident commander

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:24,690
outranks everybody else on the call

00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:28,649
including the CEO now if you choose to

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:30,750
take this on in your organization do not

00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:33,570
surprise your executives with this

00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,730
during an incident call that will not go

00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,799
terribly well but the reason this is

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,630
really essential to Incident Response is

00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,820
to understand that for the purposes of

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:44,909
incident resolution the incident

00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,159
commander is the head honcho and again

00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:49,500
they should not be an incident responder

00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,760
because there's too much going on they

00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,409
need to be able to look at the bigger

00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,539
picture and also having the incident

00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:56,309
commander freeze up our subject matter

00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:59,309
experts to be able to focus on their

00:30:56,309 --> 00:31:02,669
areas of domain knowledge and expertise

00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:05,669
right so who would be a great incident

00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:07,740
commander for the Avengers right so you

00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:09,240
might think that it's Fury right Nick

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,880
Fury would be great incident commander

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,360
he actually super isn't for a couple of

00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,420
reasons

00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,190
one is Nick Fury has a position of

00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,049
authority within the organization

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,250
sometimes that could be hard a lot of

00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:22,860
times we want to make our incident

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:24,840
commanders be managers and then that

00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,690
creates this weird power dynamic during

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,270
the call where I don't know is this Matt

00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:32,220
the manager or Matt the incident

00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:35,280
commander and my relationship with the

00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,960
other responders is different one

00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,299
interesting thing we learned at page of

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,500
duty because for a while we also felt

00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,720
like our incident commanders had to be

00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,580
very strong technically and we have

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,380
since found that some of our best

00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,390
incident commanders come from our

00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,340
product organization or our customer

00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,860
success organization or a project

00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,120
management roles scrum masters people

00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,040
like that are really good at being

00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,580
incident commanders and the reason I

00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,620
bring this up is first of all if you are

00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,419
the incident commander and you discover

00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,130
you are the best person to respond to

00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:06,510
something in the incident you have to

00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,030
now delegate someone else to be the

00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:10,830
incident commander product owners are

00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,870
almost never the subject matter expert

00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:15,720
to login to a server and restart

00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,460
something they also tend to have really

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,090
good delegation and communication skills

00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,220
and finally this is just a little bit of

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,470
a selfish thing that comes up when your

00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,850
product owners carry a pager they

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,530
suddenly care a little bit more about

00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,540
those resiliency stories or trying to

00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,860
push through the thing is at the end of

00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,210
the day you're gonna have a hard enough

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,559
time finding people willing to be

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,600
incident commander so you don't want to

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,630
limit who can actually do that so

00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,850
actually Maria Hill would be a fantastic

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:45,090
incident commander so she's got great

00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:47,370
skills at communication a delegation at

00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:49,679
decision-making and doesn't necessarily

00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:53,400
kind of have some of the challenges that

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,679
Fury might have right so row tations

00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,390
being an on-call rotations row doesn't

00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,540
matter right so one of the problems with

00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:02,490
the Avengers is they are always on call

00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,650
right like they always might be called

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,990
and here's the thing so if you're not

00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,850
part of a rotation that means you're

00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,280
never off call I have this conversation

00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,540
a lot with folks who are you know

00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,040
they're like oh don't put me in the

00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,150
on-call rotation you know I don't want

00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,290
to do that and do that I guess I got

00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,620
news for you if you're not part of a

00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,570
rota

00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,070
you're always on call the beautiful

00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:23,850
thing about being on call is you get to

00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:26,160
go off so being constantly on constantly

00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,630
needing to be a made available

00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,990
is a massive amount of stress and

00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:33,420
burnout potential and you want to

00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:35,310
escalate and ask for help so what are

00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,310
the things that we always kind of wonder

00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:41,910
when we watch the individual hero movies

00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:42,960
like the Winter Soldier where's

00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:45,660
everybody else

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,070
right what was Tony Stark doing during

00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,240
the events of the Winter Soldier when a

00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,490
whole bunch of helicarriers were

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,310
crashing around you know where was the

00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:55,020
rest of the team and for our teams that

00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:57,480
means again going back to our systems

00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,760
are complex we may think that this is

00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,890
localized within our particular domain

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,260
but we need to have ways to call in

00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,720
resources from other areas that can help

00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,970
us out we don't need to try to do

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,240
everything ourselves and this goes back

00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:14,610
to this idea of hero culture right and I

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,700
always think back years and years ago

00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:19,110
there was this poster I saw on a

00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,630
software company I'm not gonna call them

00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:24,090
out and it said how does it feel to save

00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:27,150
the day every day not all heroes wear

00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:30,120
capes and as a sysadmin in the late 90s

00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,980
I loved that poster today I look at it I

00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:35,400
said I want to burn that thing right

00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:38,250
because hero culture again gets you Tony

00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,110
I have a plan he goes off on his own

00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,970
he's gonna save the day

00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:44,520
and that makes you feel good maybe right

00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:47,250
in the moment but this leads to burnout

00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,530
it also creates brittleness and your

00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,660
organization or team you have these

00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:53,250
single points of failure when you have

00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,919
folks that are always the ones that are

00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:58,590
saving the day and this is because team

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,510
yeah that was gonna be more powerful if

00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:02,850
I could have said it teamwork makes the

00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,590
dream work right maybe you are the most

00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,480
senior person on your team maybe you're

00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,550
the one who actually wrote that function

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,200
maybe you're the one who commits to

00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:12,480
kubernetes so you must know it better

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,870
than everyone else you can't do this

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,510
alone

00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:17,820
right diverse perspectives and

00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,470
experiences all contribute it's not just

00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,480
about the technical knowledge it's about

00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,310
the questions you might ask these things

00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,620
are all essential an incident response

00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:28,650
coming from all sorts of things that

00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,780
we've done and also an incident analysis

00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:34,290
so bringing in more folks into the

00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:36,750
conversation so when we think about

00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:38,640
sharing on call right and again this is

00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,020
sometimes a controversial statement how

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,750
many people hear more

00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,150
identify as dev or software engineers in

00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,410
operation folks okay so if I tell you I

00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,150
think you should go on call you might

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,470
have strong appeals about that right but

00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,300
here's a couple things to think about

00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,700
right so here's where the problems and

00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,490
thence you Carol is the only one who

00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:59,310
carries a pager right you know that's

00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:01,260
kind of a lot of stress and so the more

00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,240
folks that are on call the less the load

00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,390
for everyone we're distributing the work

00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,520
we're distributing the load and you need

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,470
to have a consistent mechanism for

00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,720
bringing in your experts during incident

00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,610
response this is really key we need to

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,410
have that ability because that's the

00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,120
thing you know captain Burroughs was the

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,190
only one with a pager how do I get a

00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,020
hold of all of the Avengers on my team

00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,670
when they're the right person I don't

00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,200
know and the problem is they you might

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,080
have problems that we don't cause like I

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,180
don't know if pager duty works in space

00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,770
and as my coworker said yeah it probably

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,930
does but the latency is gonna kill you

00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,160
right so you need to have some way I'm

00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,350
not telling you you have to buy pager

00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,880
duty but have some consistent way of

00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,430
knowing how to get a hold of

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,860
organizational teams so what are the

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,780
things that we have learned right so

00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,370
we've learned a couple things so one is

00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,190
this is all about trust

00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,410
right we can't work together without

00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:54,210
trust without trusting our colleagues

00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,610
without trusting our other teams without

00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,260
trusting our leadership to be able to

00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,120
feel that we are in a culture and an

00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:04,170
ability where we can speak up and we can

00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:07,260
contribute blame erodes trust and then

00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:10,710
if nothing else the most important thing

00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,910
you might learn is never ever put the

00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,760
Avengers on call for your software

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:18,750
solution they are quite literally the

00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:21,330
worst at all of this so as I mentioned

00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,830
if you go to speaking Matt's frantic on

00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,140
these slides will be up there I also

00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,180
have a whole bunch of supporting links

00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,790
and articles that you might find

00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,560
interesting it's hopefully easy to

00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,180
remember you can also find me on Twitter

00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,280
at Matt Stratton

00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,530
it's just some acknowledgments I'd like

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,150
to give so Jeremy Mesa and Karissa paths

00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:42,660
helped me come up with this idea at

00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:44,640
South California Linux Expo earlier in

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,990
the year we had just seen Captain Marvel

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,400
we're trying to explain DevOps to a

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,800
couple random people we met at a hotel

00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,780
and we're trying to explain on call and

00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,070
this is what came up nelson i'm al

00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,970
harrington helped me kind of think about

00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,670
things a little

00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:58,650
more suraíh from pager duty gave me the

00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,109
ability to tweet and then Ryan kitchens

00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,240
from Netflix in addition to coming up

00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:04,230
with Groot cause analysis is also the

00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,630
one who tell you that I have the best

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:09,060
hair out of any developer advocate so we

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,349
got to love that so with that I think we

00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,270
have a few minutes if anybody has

00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:14,700
questions if not I'm happy to let

00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,680
everybody go and get some lunch earlier

00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,359
come find me during the hallway track

00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,670
I'd love to hear about what you're doing

00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:23,360
for incident response and incident

00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,800
analysis your organization thank you

00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:31,719
[Applause]
