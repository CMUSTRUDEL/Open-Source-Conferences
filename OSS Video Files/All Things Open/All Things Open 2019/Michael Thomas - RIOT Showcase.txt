00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:15,179
our next speaker is Michael Thomas he is

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,150
a patent holding systems architect for

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,180
SAS and he works at this really exciting

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,800
intersection between IOT augmented

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,170
reality and virtual reality and

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,910
artificial intelligence and he's really

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,560
an expert I mean he's threatened written

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,720
like three books on different kinds of

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,820
programming he's had thought leadership

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,520
articles published this year talking

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,010
about realities technology for

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,140
enterprise he's been with SAS for like

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,730
15 years we're really lucky that he's

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,440
agreed to come and share some of his

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,539
perspective and work with us today so

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,350
please help me give an IOT demoknight

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:53,010
welcome to Michael Thomas IOT digitizes

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,230
reality workers have had machines and

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,149
tools and their realities through all of

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,949
these industrial revolutions only

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,550
recently have they been generating

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,280
digital streams of data if you're gonna

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,479
have all this IOT when you like to see

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,820
it if you're gonna have digital twins

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,820
shouldn't some of them be in the same

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,689
space as their physical twins some of

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,549
the time when you take workers realities

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,770
you add digital twins you get

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,130
intelligent realities making work better

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,049
by making workers realities better it

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,180
could be local someone in a factory with

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,200
a headset looking at the IOT of the

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,990
Machine right in front of them

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,189
or it could be remote expert looking at

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,350
that factory from halfway around the

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,600
world it could be one of these headsets

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,200
or it could be a handheld phone or a

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,970
tablet or a desk or spatial augmented

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,810
reality augmented reality without a

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,250
headset making use of projected light it

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,220
can be real-time looking at those

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,710
streams as they come by right away you

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,729
could be seeing past data big data or

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,740
predictive so how do we get here first

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,810
off this is a story about wearables for

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,670
better or worse these new headsets are

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,560
wearables with all that that means

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,959
it's also a progression of enterprise

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,550
UIs and this doesn't happen very often

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,410
so a R and B are arriving the enterprise

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,849
roughly the same time before that you go

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,060
back many years to smartphones and

00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:24,819
tablets and before that the GUI with the

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,989
mouse and then punch cards so not very

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,300
often that we see this kind of

00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:31,360
revolution and of course mobility even

00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,310
VR is being mobile now we're built on

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,650
top of these different building blocks

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,940
along the bottom first and foremost

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,050
gaming engines is everything anybody

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,880
ever wondered why people are always

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,160
talking about AR and VR at the same time

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,170
is that a little strange it's because

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,090
it's it's stuff the gaming engines can

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:52,390
do IOT tech and not just seeing IOT

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,660
these headsets are things a phone is a

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:59,049
thing headset loaded with cameras loaded

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,019
with sensors what generate a lot of

00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:04,989
information these headsets are things on

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,970
the Internet 5g is very exciting

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,829
mobility in general but with 5g we're

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,390
getting the point where you could put on

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:13,780
a virtual reality headset and control a

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,700
machine very far away that's pretty

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,829
exciting

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,200
artificial intelligence augmented

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:22,269
reality is built on top of artificial

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,880
intelligence computer vision voice

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:26,380
recognition and that's just the start if

00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,630
you really want realities to be

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,519
intelligent then some of that

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,600
intelligence is going to be artificial

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,100
and finally multi-phase analytics

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,989
streaming data analyzing that right away

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,269
and processing into something that a

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:45,220
human could actually understand as well

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:47,530
as big data as well as predictive so is

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,049
this real in terms of a market these are

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,660
some numbers at IDC published in June of

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:55,260
this year I find that they agree with

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,730
various animals reports that I've seen

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,220
the general consensus seems to be that

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,829
it's going to be big it's going to grow

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,950
fast and it's going to be led by

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:07,329
commercial augmented reality commercial

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,780
augmented reality is expected to be

00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:14,620
about 10 times the size of commercial

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,630
virtual reality cap Jim and I went and

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,120
talked to people that we're doing AR and

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,229
VR initiatives and they found that most

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,380
of those initiatives are meeting or

00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:25,419
exceeding expectations and that most are

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,940
achieving substantial significant

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:30,729
operational benefits

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,350
in 2017 Harvard Business Review did an

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,880
article where they looked at specific

00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,380
initiatives and then looked at the

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,080
metrics coming from those initiatives a

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,780
couple highlights here in shipbuilding a

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,630
96 percent reduction in inspection time

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:49,419
and a building system company saw a 20x

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:52,449
return on investment on AR so given all

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:55,270
that what's the killer app what's the

00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,380
big idea what kind of vision can we talk

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:02,080
about here

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:04,180
in the next few minutes so let's assume

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,210
this guys here is wearing a reality

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,380
headset I think that's reasonable right

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,320
so there's another name for this stuff

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,750
called spatial computing and that's what

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,340
we're getting to here this idea that

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,139
first off workers in a world with more

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:22,449
artificial intelligence and more

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:24,400
automation are doing more managing now

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,530
one day we may actually be getting a lot

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,090
of revenue from outer space but for

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,280
right now the near future it's more

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:35,050
about the mundane so let's bring it back

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:38,349
down to earth so you go into a retail

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,639
environment instead of a manager being

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:41,500
back in the backroom looking at

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,610
analytics they can be out on the floor

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,770
where they want to be and think their

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,139
analytics right there this is

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,030
operationalizing analytics it's taking

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,800
analytics and putting it into the

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,680
reality well that's an augmented or

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,150
virtual form think about managing space

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,710
like a space here the convention center

00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,720
instead of just being purely alert

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,669
driven you could have that digital

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,930
information overlaid so you're always

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:06,610
situationally aware of what's going on

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:10,330
now then as you move into factories

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,099
manufacturing then you walk up to a

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,360
machine and you can see inside that

00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,770
machine without having to take it apart

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,180
you can look around you can see how that

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,909
machine fits in with the rest of the

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,860
machines the overall flows we need help

00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:22,449
then you can go to a remote expert they

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,370
can see what you're seeing and also have

00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:28,690
an IOT enhanced view so not just video

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,810
healthcare there's another rich area and

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:35,529
surgery is very exciting augmented

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,639
reality heads up hands-free this sounds

00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,529
like something that you'd want your

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,350
surgeon to have right having that

00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:43,449
information right in front of you

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,070
but surgery wouldn't be the only story

00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,630
here

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,449
what about fighting germs what about

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,790
having the IOT detecting where germs are

00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:54,400
likely to grow on a given day and then

00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:57,310
using augmented reality to help guide

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,260
the cleaning I have out physical therapy

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,540
physical therapists watches someone walk

00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,490
down the hall and then with augmented

00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,110
reality they can see if they're walking

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,949
the way that they want them to go they

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,389
can also see their progress over time

00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:15,040
now we're a data company we're very into

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:17,320
data IOT tends to be more concrete but

00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,600
this is data reality this is reality

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,000
created entirely from data immersive and

00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,919
a virtual reality form there are

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,889
abstractions inside the various areas

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,560
and IOT tends to serve for example

00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:31,750
supply chain your about blog chain and

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,400
then also the network so we talk about

00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,810
the Internet of Things how about being

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,150
able to see the network of things

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:43,060
without all the noise that comes from

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:45,639
physicality those previous examples you

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,830
saw analytics being put into reality in

00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,539
various ways this goes the other way

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,210
this is our SAS visual analytics product

00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:54,610
we're taking 3d CAD drawings through the

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,960
Autodesk Forge viewer or 3d CAD drawings

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,669
putting them into our reporting

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,099
interface so you still get that

00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,800
interface but you can up it on a headset

00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:04,360
you're not doing a smartphone app you're

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,190
saying to your desk but you're getting

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,680
your analytics and hands with reality in

00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:15,090
a new way so final thoughts lots of

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,190
different options across the whole space

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:21,130
including this new idea of spatial

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,380
augmented reality without headsets very

00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:26,919
sound advice here at the bottom no your

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:30,010
use case figure out how you're going to

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,650
get the data passing through and then

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,060
start looking at what kind of technology

00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,400
you need what kind of technology the

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,589
benefit fit for your problem very good

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,909
advice but there's another step and the

00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,909
other step is understanding the

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,810
technology giving it a try

00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,850
virtual reality does really well with

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,380
people that have tried it people that
