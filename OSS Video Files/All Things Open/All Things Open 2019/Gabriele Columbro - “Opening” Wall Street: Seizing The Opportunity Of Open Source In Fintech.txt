Title: Gabriele Columbro - “Opening” Wall Street: Seizing The Opportunity Of Open Source In Fintech
Publication date: 2019-11-04
Playlist: All Things Open 2019
Description: 
	Financial institutions and fintech vendors are amongst the larger producers of software and employers of highly talented developers worldwide. Yet while Wall Street has been consistently increasing its consumption of open source, this interactive-by-nature ecosystem has been largely missing out on the opportunities presented by collaborating, contributing and building a business model around open source.

In the context of a massive generational and technological evolution, with cloud and decentralized technologies rapidly taking over the industry, the opportunity for an open fintech is huge for financial institution decision makers, for developers and generally for “we the people”, downstream users of the financial services complex.

In this session, Gab, Executive Director of the Fintech Open Source Foundation, the first and only open source Foundation solely focused on financial technology, will discuss the state of open source in the industry, discussing trends, challenges, opportunities, real life case studies of collaboration and extending a call for participation to the extended FLOSS community.

[Music]

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,000
but again thanks for making time for

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,570
being here my name is Gabriella : bro

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,929
I'm the executive director of finis the

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,240
FinTech open source foundation I

00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:23,789
realized that financial services and

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,470
open source is almost Exuma Roenick but

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,410
we want to change that perception and

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,369
that's really in a nutshell what venus

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,170
is about by the way it is finis some

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,750
people they call it finis some people

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,570
they call it fin OS we're not an

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,820
operative system yet hopefully at the

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,710
certain point we'll have enough

00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,570
components out there to be Fino ass so

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,250
it's kind of my secret secret weapon I'm

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,800
keeping it there so this will be the

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,510
background of me I actually do not come

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,660
from financial services I've only had

00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:02,070
five years now in my tenure in financial

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:05,220
services been a learning experience in

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,659
good and bad ways I actually come from

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,240
the open source communities I'm really

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,150
excited to be the for the first time

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,900
here at all things open I mean Apache

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,330
commit that I see Jim there who led the

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,640
way in Apache and I'm just a committer

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,920
actually probably emeritus I haven't

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,770
been committing for a while but

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,330
certainly I've spent many years both in

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,430
community open source and commercial

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,740
open source working for a company called

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:37,409
alfresco commercial open source content

00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:45,479
enterprise content management and few

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:47,909
years ago I've had the luck to and the

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,799
honor to be called to run what at that

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,250
time was called the symphony Software

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,780
Foundation an open source foundation

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,200
which I'm sure you're all familiar with

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,649
the concept focused on financial

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,990
services focus focused on they're only

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,450
solving specific challenges for the

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,399
financial services industry which I'm

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,110
sure you would agree if you're from the

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,989
industry that there's a lot of potential

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,490
for collaboration better collaboration

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,650
across the

00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,330
but also that understands what does it

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,590
mean to be a financial services open

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,310
source foundation while also

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,290
understanding the challenges that you

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,560
know what it takes to collaborate across

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,480
the firewall in a regulated industry you

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,840
know certainly when I joined I found

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,670
very hard and very complicated the way

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,420
these people work with each other or

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,750
didn't but it is also understandable

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,010
that they are very risk-averse

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,160
enterprises they work in a highly

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,430
regulated context in which even talking

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,500
to another company might generate you

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,040
know down the line pretty big issues and

00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:00,000
so the Symphony Software Foundation now

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,760
FinTech open-source foundation is really

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,950
focused on leveraging open source and

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,709
open standards as a mean to sort of

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,650
solve these two issues one better

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,630
collaboration on technology that is not

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,209
necessarily differentiating for these

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,760
companies and be helping them through

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,380
the curve of maturity as to how you can

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,870
do open source safely whether it's

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,850
consuming contributing or even being in

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,390
a forum with you know ten other

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,980
regulated companies because you know

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:32,250
over the years open-source has shown

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,620
that it is a safe way of collaborating

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,750
and so by reusing all we learned in

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,250
other communities we're making them feel

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:44,040
more and more comfortable now I think

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:48,329
what I think unique in what we do is

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,510
really the composition of our community

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:55,130
you can see a lot of you know pretty

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,709
pretty interesting logos as far as the

00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,600
financial services community goes but we

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,090
didn't want this to be a you know a big

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,239
boys club this was supposed to be always

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,310
an open forum and open foundation and so

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,049
we're happy that over the years we have

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,510
grown representation from fin tech

00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,329
companies we have grown representation

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:18,109
also from large tech you know open

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:22,140
source companies Red Hat get up get lab

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:24,330
some of us some of them are here and so

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,520
I think the element of cross-pollination

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,410
that you see

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,570
you know I'm based in San Francisco and

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:34,200
and most of the banks now want to call

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,360
themselves technology companies you know

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,400
thinking that that maybe sometimes

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,530
creating an Innovation Lab and throw in

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,290
some big bin bags out there it's gonna

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,330
make them innovative well I do think

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,330
that actually as my experience from the

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,740
community has taught me bringing actual

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,110
people together from different

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,630
backgrounds really helps the cultural

00:04:52,110 --> 00:05:00,390
change that is needed for such a closed

00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:02,610
industry - to do open source we started

00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,590
a few years ago I'm gonna show you a

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,930
little bit of a history again this was

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,900
sort of the breakdown of our community

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,410
in terms of tech FinTech and financial

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:17,970
services companies but just a quick note

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:19,290
on our history as I mentioned we used to

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,740
be called the symphony Software

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:25,200
Foundation I got called to run the

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,470
foundation in two hundred to be called

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,190
to to run the foundation in 2015

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,560
originally the foundation was created

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,710
around a software called Symphony which

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,090
is not the PHP framework it's not the I

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,130
think there's the other two or three

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,220
symphonies out there for which we

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:44,760
regularly used to get supporting queries

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:48,000
but it's a collaboration software that

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,550
was put together as an investment by

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,110
Goldman Sachs and several of those other

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,090
investment banks that you've seen up

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:57,900
there and the original goal was to in a

00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:00,690
way challenge the you know locking the

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,760
many of these firms had in Bloomberg at

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,490
least as far as the chat and

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,160
collaboration platform went and that's

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:12,060
where I think it's important to realize

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,040
that they like open source was a really

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,200
functional part of that investment all

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,930
these banks you know join up together to

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,790
invest in this company but that

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,900
investment will not have happened if the

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,810
code was not open source

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:27,480
none of these banks felt comfortable to

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,570
you know invest in a highly secure and

00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,340
to end encrypted company communication

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,950
company where they will put their very

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,920
important regulated information if it

00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,199
wasn't open source and so that's for me

00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,639
it was really the first

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:47,610
sort of beam of light in this industry

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,019
as far as my experience has been you

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,789
know they called me and say hey banks

00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,649
want to do a cloud software and they

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:56,579
want to do it open-source I kind of blew

00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:58,469
my mind five years ago if you fast

00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,999
forward a couple of years we realized

00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:03,269
that the opportunity in the industry was

00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:05,879
much broader this is an industry that

00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:07,619
has to collaborate by nature at least in

00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,509
their daily business they trade with

00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:11,369
each other by side south side

00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:17,519
they exchange information they exchange

00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:19,019
money so there is no reason why given

00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,989
that they all comply to the same

00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:24,689
regulations you know they couldn't look

00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:27,239
at better standardization in the form of

00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:28,860
data but actually better common

00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,839
implementation of this type of

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,349
regulations and so that's what we

00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:36,509
realized in late 2017 that there was a

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:40,289
bigger opportunity and we expanded into

00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:41,939
the FinTech open source foundation our

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,319
footprint is certainly in capital

00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,929
markets in investment banking that's

00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,999
what we come from but the Charter and

00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:52,079
the name of the foundation is was made

00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:54,239
broad enough because again the same sort

00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,219
of opportunities are there when it comes

00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:57,869
to retail when it comes to payments when

00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:00,569
it comes to you know ultimately

00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:03,119
everything that as as the average joe's

00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:06,199
have to interact with in terms of the

00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:08,729
financial services complex

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,979
that's where mid last year we announced

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:14,550
the FinTech open source foundation we've

00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:15,929
seen a really substantial growth in

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,409
terms of members in terms of

00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:20,909
contributions be happy to answer any

00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:25,169
question later on in terms of more

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:31,079
specific projects that we do but as far

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:32,809
as today's presentation goes there are

00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,629
two takeaways for me

00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:40,019
the first one is time is actually right

00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:43,139
for open source in financial services

00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:47,009
again it's not an easy challenge I don't

00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:48,839
wanna you know diminish the complexity

00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:51,209
of having highly regulated industries

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,500
collaborate with each other but

00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:53,279
hopefully by the end of this

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,730
presentation

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,860
I'll be able to show you why the drivers

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:04,019
are aligned for all the players that

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,759
partake to the ecosystem and finally you

00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,860
know as I said this is not an easy

00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:12,959
challenge we need help we need help from

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,819
individuals communities are certainly

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,649
you know modern open-source communities

00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:18,480
we think about the Linux Foundation or

00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:21,089
even our foundation are certainly

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,920
corporate founded that funded there's a

00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:24,660
lot of you know corporate money that

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,129
comes in through membership but

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,370
ultimately communities are made of

00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:32,639
individuals and you know individuals

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,470
like you there are ready expert in how

00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,089
to collaborate in financial services and

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:40,889
can become mentors in this community

00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:43,860
would mean you know teaching by example

00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:47,279
would be will mean you know hopefully an

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,740
opportunity for you as an individual you

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,089
know to access a market that you know

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,389
from a development standpoint it's been

00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:55,980
largely closed over the years and

00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:57,779
hopefully for your organization if

00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,910
you're working for a consulting company

00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,329
a company that sells tech in financial

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,589
services there's a huge opportunity for

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:07,230
commercial open source and hopefully I

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:11,779
can pass the message by the end of this

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:15,029
target trying to fix my microphone here

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:17,189
so I want to start with a little bit of

00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:19,860
a parallel here because I think it's

00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:23,790
important to put in context of how

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:27,779
quickly this might happen or slowly you

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:30,029
judge but when I think about I started

00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,790
my career in open source about 15 years

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:35,550
ago actually in government and open

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,620
source I was as you can hear I'm clearly

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,500
from that Italian part of the Silicon

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,860
Valley I was working in Italy

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:47,850
definitely not the most sort of tech

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:51,529
advanced you know or open innovative

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:55,309
country at that time I moved to Holland

00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:59,100
for a project for the Ministry of

00:10:55,309 --> 00:11:00,889
Foreign Affairs and and as I moved to

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,750
Holland this was 2007

00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:07,020
actually the Queen was talking about

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:11,360
open source the Queen like a 75

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:15,060
so person was talking about you know

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,940
public tenders should only be assigned

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,740
to open source companies unless meaning

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,920
it's kind of an opt-out model like you

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,320
either you know choose an open source

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:30,710
vendor or you gotta explain me why why

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:33,750
or you know letting go of this lock-in

00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,520
reduction type opportunity and and that

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,400
was pretty amazing to me again coming

00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,630
from a country where it's been really

00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,490
hard to do business and definitely

00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,180
innovate in terms of technology was it

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,190
was amazing

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,070
now that was 2007 but if you

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,260
fast-forward you know 10 years we're now

00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:54,630
living in a world where the American

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:57,720
government has a fully sort of it's big

00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:00,330
proponent and has an open sort of

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,460
repository of older code in code dog of

00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:07,830
fostering reuse the European Union has

00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,840
communique Union wide open source

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,900
strategy and I mean this is just ten

00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:17,070
years I mean in terms of government time

00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:18,560
this is not too much and so again there

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,760
are many similarities between

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,610
governments and financial services in

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,770
terms of how regulated they are and in

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,530
terms of even sort of culturally they're

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:31,320
not in 2007 nobody will look at the

00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:33,960
government as a tech organization and so

00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,670
what I see here is the an industry that

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,450
is going very much through the same

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:41,070
process of innovation and I think their

00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,840
open source can play a key role so

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,700
hopefully we can take less than ten

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,500
years my gut feeling is that ten years

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,930
is probably about right given we're

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,720
already four or five into our journey as

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,730
feena's but again it is perfectly

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,310
possible for about open source in in

00:12:53,730 --> 00:13:03,290
government fifteen years ago it was a

00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:05,760
hard sell so but to understand why and

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,530
hopefully agree on the fact that open

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,360
source the financial services ready for

00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,940
open source

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,820
there are really three sort of aspects

00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,770
to consider first of all the technology

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,870
landscape is changing drastically in

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,920
financial services I mean even if you

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,680
don't work in in this

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,829
three you probably heard about FinTech

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,610
you probably have heard about

00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:30,180
decentralized technologies like

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:34,829
blockchain you probably heard that you

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:38,550
know users like end-users are getting

00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:41,550
more and more sort of requiring in terms

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,440
of the user experience that they expect

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,000
from this type of companies very much

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,769
like we're all used to do everything

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,110
from a phone if you think about your

00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:52,740
experience in travel or experience in

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,180
hotels more and more the several fin

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,000
tech companies are trying to bring that

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,579
sort of native user experience to

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,130
financial services and so the landscape

00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:04,199
is changing a lot and you know one way

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:08,160
to look at it is not anymore this

00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:10,680
monolithic siloed independent stacks

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,040
that hardly talk to each other but we're

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,550
moving more and more to a common API

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,579
layer again we're not there yet but if

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:23,250
you think about regulations like gdpr or

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:26,040
PSD - there are more and more trying to

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,959
standardize the layer of access to this

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,810
data in a way that it will be brought

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,430
back into the hands of the consumers and

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,649
so this is forcing more and more

00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,410
institutions to really look at am i

00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:40,320
selling a tech product or am i selling a

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,420
platform in which I'm building you know

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,640
connections between value producers and

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,300
value consumers on top of it and so if

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,820
you consider you know the new landscape

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,579
it's easier to think that potentially an

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,199
open-source platform whereby the value

00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:58,050
is not in the code but it's in the

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,449
network and it's in the value that is

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:03,290
exchanged on top of the platform make

00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:03,290
more and more sense

00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:11,880
definitely the perception is changing I

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,410
mean five years ago when I started and I

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,990
was going around and pitching open

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,060
source to banks those guys thought I was

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,490
an Italian open source hippie I mean

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,110
there's there's no you know hiding that

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,420
I mean I had red looks when I was a kid

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:28,800
so probably they found the picture on

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,630
Google but definitely in a few years and

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,240
this guy if you don't know him Chris

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:38,310
Skinner is a pretty

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:40,800
influential influencer in FinTech but

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:44,040
you're hearing more and more talk around

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,600
whether they truly fully understand you

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,529
know the strategic benefit of open

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,260
source and so they are sort of in the

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:55,350
top right corner of an ideal maturity

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:58,470
curve or at least they grasp the

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:01,800
potential for cost savings for talent

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,600
acquisition or retention for actually

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,399
even making money on open source

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:11,760
you know last year's github and Red Hat

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,649
acquisitions clearly sort of pointed

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,450
their attention to the fact that again

00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:21,930
open source doesn't necessarily always

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:24,990
mean free or you know that you can make

00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:28,620
money on it and so the technology is

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:31,500
changing the perception is changing but

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,380
one what our focus on today is really on

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:39,589
which problem we're trying to solve for

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:42,270
whom like why the drivers are aligning

00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:43,860
for the key players in the industry to

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,649
be looking at open source more and more

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,620
seriously and when I think about who's

00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:51,390
involved of course financial

00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,450
institutions we will spend some time on

00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:58,560
talking why they are looking at open

00:16:54,450 --> 00:17:03,029
source but I think regulators it's

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,630
really another very important player

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:08,069
that has to buy-in into this idea of you

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,380
know open source regulation or

00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:15,120
implementing open source regulations in

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:17,550
an open source way commercial companies

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,410
open source companies there's I think

00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,000
personally I mean I'm running an open

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,069
source foundation so I cannot get into

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,730
commercial venture and I'm now giving

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:29,370
commercial advice here but certainly

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:32,790
it's a pretty green field market when it

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:36,420
comes to you know commercial open source

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:38,580
company disrupting existing incumbents

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,370
in the industry it's a highly locked-in

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,750
industry and I'm finally and most

00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,900
importantly I always go back to

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,740
individuals whether you are a developer

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,820
in the industry

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,529
and you want to start developing in a

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,320
more modern way more open way and

00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:58,470
solving problems across the fire world

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,260
whether you are a open source developer

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:04,110
that is looking for a pretty potentially

00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,480
highly paid next new job or whether you

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,429
are you know an end user of the

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,279
financial services complex I believe by

00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:14,429
you know having this firm's work more

00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,580
transparently not only we get that user

00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:20,669
experience that we were saying before

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,830
improved barreled so hopefully we can I

00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:25,679
don't want to overshoot here but we try

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,299
to avoid things like in 2008 and 2009

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,919
you know there should be more

00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:36,200
transparency in the industry I think we

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:36,200
all agree with that so let's get started

00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:47,039
from individuals I kind of went ahead of

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:52,110
myself but I think again when I started

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:55,080
in 2015 and sort of the talk of the day

00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:59,549
was open API is I was like wait open API

00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:03,929
is isn't isn't like web 2.0 like a 2005

00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:06,270
thing it clearly came to me that there

00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:09,120
is amazing talent in the industry but

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,549
oftentimes talent that cannot leverage

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,440
new technologies either because they

00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,970
cannot consume open-source but

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,390
definitely because even when they can

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,529
consume it they have to maintain it

00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,299
internally they cannot contribute back

00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:24,480
and so that clearly sort of breaks the

00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:26,610
pattern and the cycle of innovation so I

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,909
feel that there is a big sort of

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,169
Liberatore aspect in what we're doing as

00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,909
a foundation trying to build an

00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:37,220
open-source community of the likes that

00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:37,220
we have seen in other industries

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,289
open-source developers we talked about

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,919
it I hope by the end of this talk

00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:49,140
my main goal for being here today is not

00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:52,710
to have new member companies is really

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,659
to appeal to individual developers who

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,429
can help us grow and accelerate what we

00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:59,730
do in the community there is a huge

00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:00,540
demand for talent and you know one hand

00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,090
we've opened

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,770
banks to look at open source is a great

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:10,380
talent pool I hope you guys are gonna

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:11,880
join in and help us out there there's an

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,250
interesting aspect that I'm realizing

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,710
more and more which is also it's not

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:20,010
really just the developers in financial

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:23,430
services firms one thing that you might

00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:25,530
be enough familiar with is that there is

00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,740
a high churn in this industry even at

00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:31,590
executive level my board members change

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,150
once a year for the same firm they

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,710
typically move from company to company

00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,000
and there's a good chance that in the

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,900
next company they're still gonna be

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,510
working with us but most of these execs

00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,250
end up moving to the next company and

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,020
having to clean pretty much the same

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,970
mess that they had cleaned before not

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,360
being able at all to reuse what they've

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:53,400
done in the previous endeavors and so

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,900
you know I think both from a career

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,840
standpoint there's an opportunity for

00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,300
again architects technology

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,690
decision-makers to be able to build on

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:06,900
previous achievements and honestly to do

00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,760
a bit more of an interesting job rather

00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,290
than always sort of solving the same

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,660
problems that they've done in the in

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:15,300
their previous firm and then finally we

00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:20,010
talked about us as users of the

00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:21,780
financial services complex it is my

00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:24,270
belief and you know we're probably 5 to

00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:27,620
10 years away there but like the

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:31,020
constant struggle between regulators and

00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,510
financial services companies on sort of

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,050
where you tune that level of regulation

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:38,820
I think if we were able to make sort of

00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:42,540
a third solution that is to make

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:46,650
regulation much more efficient by the

00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:48,900
means of open source and open that way

00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,210
you know we don't need so much oversight

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,130
because everything is or mostly is

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,960
transparent and hopefully as sort of

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,810
users of the financial services complex

00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,310
we can benefit from that and inspiron

00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:04,140
see that's what individuals I think can

00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,580
benefit from open sourcing financial

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,530
services but how about financial

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,820
institutions I mean it's important to

00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:13,620
understand that the landscape has

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:15,870
changed in over the last 10 years

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,650
definitely the top line is not where he

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,340
used to be

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:24,029
I mean I'm now claiming that my members

00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:27,120
are not making money but if you think if

00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:29,490
you compare for example the growth of a

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,279
you know one of the those financial

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:34,830
civil institutions versus you know the

00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:38,390
growth of AWS or any of the tech

00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:41,010
companies I mean they're probably one

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:47,100
order of magnitude smaller I think last

00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:48,539
year was the first time that the last

00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,360
two years sorry what is the first time

00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:52,860
that some of the financial service

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,320
sector we started growing and we're

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,570
still talking about a 10% growth

00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,549
year-on-year which is nothing compared

00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,960
to you know your your hundred percent

00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:06,210
year-on-year that you see from a tech

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,549
company and you know righteously you

00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,460
would you would say but the cost of

00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:14,460
regulatory has become much more

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,649
increased after 2009 you know just as an

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,940
example the cost of me feet - I don't

00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:21,299
know if you're familiar with it but it's

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,950
a european-wide regulation that was

00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:26,010
introduced I think a couple of years ago

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:28,110
it is estimated that the overall costs

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,990
of implementation was around 2.1

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,640
billions I mean it's a huge amount of

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,029
money that these companies have to do

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,340
have to spend without really any effect

00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:41,399
on the top-line it's just a bottom line

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:45,890
item so the top line is is not growing

00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:52,039
as it did the bottom line is growing

00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:56,750
pretty substantially they are looking at

00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:59,460
you know very different ways of

00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,880
innovating like throwing money at the

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,020
problem

00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,149
as it used to be it's not enough anymore

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,669
just to tell you how the perception is

00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:13,950
changing this is an article from 2013

00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:16,399
talks about slanged I don't know if you

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,840
guys are familiar with it it's a

00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:21,960
language that was developed inside

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:25,049
Goldman Sachs actually was came through

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,030
an acquisition in late 90s and it's been

00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:28,830
widely regarded as

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,660
a big differentiator for governments at

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:34,530
they build on top of it they build their

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,870
SEC DB piece of infrastructure which is

00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:40,110
the database of secure it is exactly

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:42,240
sort of what it sounds like and look

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:44,310
it's been widely recognized as a big

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,630
differentiator for Goldman with respect

00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:53,790
to several other firms you know up to

00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:57,560
2013 this is an article talking about

00:24:53,790 --> 00:25:01,320
the same exact thing four years later

00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:03,960
basically saying yes is it rank is great

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,920
SEC DB is great but it's a proprietary

00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,080
language you only can know that if you

00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:14,550
work for Goldman or if you're trained

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:17,010
for Goldman so is it a secret sauce or

00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:20,160
is it actually weakness because other

00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:22,980
firms have been able to start on Python

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,170
which sort of didn't wasn't really as

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,450
developed when they started working on

00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,850
it and so they quickly can leverage

00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,620
things like tensor flow like pandas

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,050
which is a data analytics library if you

00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,930
guys are not familiar with it and so

00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:39,990
you're seeing like open source actually

00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:42,030
helping other firms to catch up in a way

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:45,090
in terms of the the technology so what

00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:47,190
was seen as a big differentiator is

00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:49,460
potentially becoming a liability like

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,070
building everything in-house is now

00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,390
widely recognized as a potential

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,640
liability for some of these firms and so

00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,880
that's I think a clear example of you

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,550
know this industry trying to look for

00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,980
new ways of innovating and open source

00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:11,330
is a really good answer for that now

00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:14,970
obviously there is a hate and love

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:16,080
relationship with the Silicon Valley you

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,430
know everyone wants to be a technology

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,310
company if you guys are not familiar

00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:24,120
with the guy on the left I'm sure you

00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:29,010
know the guy on the right is Jamie Dimon

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,510
is the the CEO of JPMorgan so there

00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,190
certainly is a hate and love

00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,960
relationship on one hand there is this

00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:37,140
there's one thing to be technology

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,170
companies on the other hand there is

00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:43,170
sort of a constant complain that

00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,910
big tech is stealing their cake because

00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,970
they are not a regulated business and so

00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:52,200
they are much is much easier for them to

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:56,370
you know launch a credit card or really

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,830
eating away at their business but again

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:01,350
on the other hand in terms of love they

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,100
are stealing a lot of resources from the

00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:06,860
Silicon Valley

00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:09,030
Goldman just hired an exec from AWS

00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,640
square this waste and exact from the

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:14,580
Rison so there is this this you know

00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,490
hate but mostly love relationship just

00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:20,100
just as an anecdote I live in San

00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,380
Francisco and I asked my board several

00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,240
times I'm like do you guys you know

00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,680
should I move to New York I mean you

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,070
guys are all in New York you guys are in

00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,480
London probably I should be there and

00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,340
they told me no you should stay in the

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,370
Silicon Valley it's like because because

00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,410
you bring innovation and like well okay

00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:40,260
thank you I love living in California

00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:42,240
very similar to Italy but it's not that

00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,600
innovation is a virus you know it's not

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,050
that I'm gonna catch it in out west and

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,600
then bring it East but just to tell you

00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:54,150
again that there is this this at least

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,820
at the executive level a big tension for

00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:00,720
for drastically changing the way they

00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:03,630
operate and they do technology one thing

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,540
I gotta say and as you can see I'm

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:09,090
embodying it but one thing I gotta say

00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,830
that that New York has caught up with

00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:14,400
the Silicon Valley is certainly the

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:17,760
dress code then if you guys are familiar

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,370
with midtown uniform Instagram account

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,990
but if you go around Midtown you'll see

00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:25,560
a bunch of people with a button-down

00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:27,000
shirt and the vest now two years you

00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,320
know don't tell my parents and I'm

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,430
wearing a vest because otherwise they

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:35,070
don't let me in in Italy anymore but

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:37,740
it's pretty funny to see how even the

00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:40,170
dress code in a way this feel that have

00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,940
been usually sort of that that's sort of

00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,530
their attempt to be innovative and it's

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,660
and I'm not really making fun of it

00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:48,840
other than the fact that it's not really

00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:50,850
diverse community there in Midtown and

00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,720
and this Instagram account makes a lot

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:57,650
of fun of that

00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:01,430
but again you see these there's many

00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,130
ways in which sort of the Silicon Alley

00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:10,240
is trying to get more and more similar

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:12,830
to the Silicon Valley now jokes aside

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,550
open source and financial services is

00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:18,290
not it's not a new thing it's it's not

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:21,760
you know saying that these companies are

00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:24,620
not doing open source it's inaccurate

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,860
one of our platinum members github was

00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:30,950
so kind to pull up this data for us

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:34,700
these are actually repulsive commits

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:37,190
repositories and committers us with

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,110
email addresses associated with our

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,220
members with those banks that you see

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:45,830
out there and this is not just in

00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:48,770
Phoenix I mean I wish I had 45,000

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:52,580
repositories and they're famous but

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:55,340
again just to tell you that whether they

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,800
know it or not that's a different

00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,690
question and we'll talk about it but

00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,550
like financial services already doing

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,930
open source they're doing several amount

00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,550
of commits they have a lot of

00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,890
repositories the maintainer there and

00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:09,140
active committers now when you put it in

00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:13,070
the context of how many developers these

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:15,740
firms have my developed bore memory

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:19,370
JPMorgan has I think 16,000 developers

00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:21,110
working for him it might not be such a

00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:23,030
huge number if you normalize it with

00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,860
respect to the potential that these

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:28,820
firms have to do open source but again

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:32,270
they're doing it and I mentioned before

00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:35,000
whether they know it or not I kind of

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:39,770
slaughtered here the curve of software

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:43,130
adoption to my purpose but there's

00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:45,400
really still a pretty broad spectrum in

00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:47,510
terms of firms in financial services

00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,300
what's their relationship with open

00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,460
source I mean we do have a few firms

00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,550
that are doing strategic contributions

00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:58,100
you know the the simple example before

00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:59,960
it's a pretty strategic one you are open

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:03,140
sourcing a piece of software to

00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,030
commoditize a competitor or a vendor in

00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,470
which you're strongly locked in into

00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,760
well

00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:13,360
pretty strategic but most of the firms

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,330
are really between ad hoc contribution

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:21,030
or at least a properly controlled

00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:23,799
consumption several of them still doing

00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:26,559
largely manual consumption of the open

00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,419
source or even the most interesting one

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:33,280
are the one that tell me no no we don't

00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:35,980
do open source like really like that's

00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,419
probably the worst possible state where

00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,870
you're thinking that you're not doing

00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:42,850
open source but the truth is developers

00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:45,789
find a way to do open source I mean

00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:47,110
either 30 percent of your stack is

00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:48,730
already built on open source

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,500
technologies or if they want to

00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:55,059
contribute back they're gonna find a way

00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:57,700
to do it so it's it it I think it urges

00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:01,030
these companies to find a way to

00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:03,940
actually provide a path to open source

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:07,570
for their thousands and thousands of

00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:10,840
developers shameless plug here if you're

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:13,539
interested in more knowing more we're

00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:17,110
publishing an actual analyst report

00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:19,480
later in the year really we interviewed

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:22,390
several companies we have data from

00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,610
github hopefully this is gonna serve as

00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:30,460
a baseline for us to track and measure

00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:33,070
growth over the next year's now last but

00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:37,299
not least well actually we have two more

00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:40,000
to go number three is the regulators I

00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:41,830
don't know how much you know about

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,230
regulators in financial services and

00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,350
again I'm also still learning after only

00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:52,330
a few years in this industry is a very

00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:54,640
varied landscape but they are suffering

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:58,510
of several of the same problems in terms

00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,130
of talent acquisition that the financial

00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:04,750
services companies are seeing I mean

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:07,150
let's be clear cool developers typically

00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,710
want to work for tech companies they

00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:11,650
want to work for companies that have a

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,809
high-growth pre-ipo and they're gonna

00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,890
get their stocks and and so on and so

00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:17,740
forth

00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,940
and so financial service companies are

00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,059
having issues recruit

00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:24,519
the best talent if you on top you tell

00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:26,619
them hey and you you're a great open

00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,899
source coder and you have gotta come to

00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:30,549
my firm and you're not gonna be able to

00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:32,440
do open source anymore and continue

00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:34,749
fostering your own profile well you can

00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,919
easily see why people would choose

00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:42,729
something different regulators are in an

00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:45,690
even tougher spot because at least JP

00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:49,059
Morgan or Goldman Sachs can throw

00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:53,349
buckets of money at you a regulator

00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:55,029
can't they don't have the you know not

00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:57,039
only they don't have the appeal but they

00:33:55,029 --> 00:34:00,489
also don't have the financial capacity

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:03,609
of hiring top talent and so what you end

00:34:00,489 --> 00:34:06,009
up with is regulators they're oftentimes

00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:09,520
write regulations that are not up to par

00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:11,049
with technology we're working and I will

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,250
touch on it later but we've talked we're

00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:17,770
working on a cloud certification effort

00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:20,919
for all these banks to mutual eyes the

00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:25,119
way they implement controls for going in

00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:28,329
cloud and not only that technical value

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,129
there but there's also policy and legal

00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:31,720
value like in terms of interpreting

00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:33,369
these policies because often time these

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,309
policies comes from the regulator with

00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:39,579
very little connection to the actual

00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:42,700
technology they are trying to impose

00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:44,950
those regulations on and so I think this

00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,799
is probably the most important

00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:50,020
compelling item for regulators in the

00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:52,869
end what they do is mandating how a

00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:56,919
certain software should work and also

00:34:52,869 --> 00:35:01,900
how who has access to configure deploy

00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:05,049
touch change so really if we had open

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:07,930
source software implementing a certain

00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:09,520
regulation and a fully automated CI CD

00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,859
pipeline to deploy that piece of

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,170
software there really wouldn't be the

00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:17,890
need for regulators to go and check

00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:19,869
every single company not only what their

00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:22,029
software does but also how its deployed

00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:23,470
and who has access to it obviously this

00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:25,450
is a grand vision it's a long-term

00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:29,200
vision I don't you know I don't want to

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:32,450
oversimplify this but we're certainly

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,660
seeing more and more examples

00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:37,310
of how you know regulators can play

00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,140
Cairo a key role I mean they're not

00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,820
gonna ever endorse any single

00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,130
organization that's what regulators do

00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,560
but if you are able to sell them in the

00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,420
idea that they should recommend the

00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:51,859
government source like the Queen in

00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:56,240
Holland in 2007 I think there would be a

00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:58,579
huge advantage for them I talked about

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,200
cloud certification that's one of the

00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:06,680
areas where we're seeing real traction

00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:08,540
in the community kyc is another area I

00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,790
don't know guys you're familiar with it

00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:13,750
but no your client and antimony

00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:16,400
laundering regulations are pretty

00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:18,260
important and fundamental to every

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,510
person interacting with the financial

00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,119
services system and that's basically

00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,940
when you have to fill all with the same

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,460
information when you go to 20 different

00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:32,420
banks and is exactly the same or if

00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:36,640
you're younger with the crypto exchanges

00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:39,710
and crypto trading platforms same thing

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,930
well every firm spends about 50 million

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,839
a year on kyc and largely what they do

00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:48,260
is exactly the same thing collecting the

00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:51,829
same information validating it gains the

00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,109
same you know credit organizations or

00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:56,450
Social Security Administration exactly

00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:58,040
the same and there's no literally no

00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:02,329
advantage the top line doesn't make

00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:06,710
money it only costs money so you'll hear

00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:08,690
from us a little further in a month from

00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:11,630
now where we have a big conference which

00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:14,270
I'm gonna shamelessly plug later on in

00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:16,040
the deck but hopefully we'll have a big

00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:21,680
announcement in in this area moving

00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:26,150
forward now last but not least open

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,950
source companies I mean you guys are all

00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:30,470
familiar if you're here you probably

00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,930
have been through the last 15 20 years

00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:37,579
in which open source has literally taken

00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:40,730
over industry by industry and one of the

00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:42,079
common you know traits I mean I've been

00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,900
working for this company called the

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,130
frisco for seven years and our pitch for

00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,410
the first years was like

00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,920
hey we are like this other company but

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:53,599
we're open source I mean I believe that

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,680
probably we are a little past that stage

00:37:53,599 --> 00:38:01,490
in which open source is your sales

00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:03,349
differentiator but the common trait of

00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:05,359
these indices that were disrupted by

00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:08,630
open source was that they were highly

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:12,200
locked in there were players which were

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:14,900
highly monopolizing a certain use case a

00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,150
business case and open source could be

00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:19,250
seen as just you know I can give you the

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,109
same functionality for a fraction of the

00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:25,549
cost and by the way you can switch at

00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:27,619
any time Financial Services by far the

00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:30,559
most locked-in industry that I've seen

00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:32,690
in my career there are certain area of

00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:37,220
the financial services workflow which

00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:40,339
are fully controlled by only one company

00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:42,410
has sort of the regulatory as the

00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:46,490
features and the regulatory connections

00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:48,589
the politics if you want to fulfill that

00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:51,079
part of the workflow and so I think

00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:54,259
that's where the the biggest opportunity

00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,720
lies for people that have experience in

00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:59,750
building a commercial business model

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:04,309
around open source I mean don't get me

00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:09,950
wrong is not that there are no open

00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:12,200
source or open FinTech companies open

00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,450
pennyvos one of our members they build a

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,329
an electron based container for traders

00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:22,240
to build their applications

00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:25,069
quanto peon and quantconnect our SAS

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,509
platforms that allow you they have at

00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:33,019
least a common open source back testing

00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:39,289
engine where you can test your algos and

00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:41,180
your investment strategies h2o is an

00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:45,410
artificial intelligent company which

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:48,730
does a lot of open source but there's

00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:51,650
not really a lot of FinTech companies

00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:55,509
that have successfully used the open

00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:59,160
source business model now I'm using here

00:39:55,509 --> 00:40:01,980
something created by Joseph Jax

00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:06,060
is the founder of open-sourced of

00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:08,430
capital is a you know former technology

00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:11,130
is now investor in in costs commercial

00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:13,230
open source companies he created just a

00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:15,240
simple index of commercial open source

00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,490
companies who you know meet certain

00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,590
criteria including any reached hundred

00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:22,790
million dollars and there's literally

00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:25,770
zero commercial open source companies

00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:27,900
from FinTech that have reached that mark

00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,420
so not only we have a highly locked-in

00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:33,510
environment but we also don't have a lot

00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:35,430
of competition out there so you know I I

00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,730
told about the benefit for individuals I

00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:40,470
hope that you know also if you are

00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:42,150
representing a services company or a

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,220
tech company or a fin tech company

00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,650
you'll consider the opportunity of

00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:49,520
becoming the de facto standard through

00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:54,110
open source and then use that as your

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,110
you know springboard for your business

00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:02,850
finally and that's where we help I

00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:05,880
cannot use the word blockchain in my

00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:09,960
world simple as that so that's that's

00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,730
the B word it's because obviously there

00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,950
is again hate and love relationship on

00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:15,960
one hand certainly they're looking into

00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:18,630
blockchain on the other hand there is

00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,140
this fear that the you know blockchain

00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:23,580
will run the whole financial services

00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:26,010
set of institutions out of business in

00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:28,370
in ten years but again I think that's

00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:30,480
where there is another opportunity our

00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:35,690
foundation really is about bringing

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:40,230
together two generations two different

00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:42,150
approaches to building technology we do

00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:44,340
have a decentralized ecosystem program

00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:46,280
but it's very nasan it's it's really a

00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,660
place older if you want for

00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,440
contributions so that's certainly

00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:56,220
another area with obviously we've seen

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,050
fin tech companies sort of springing

00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:02,760
right and left over the last ten years

00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:04,710
or maybe more like three four years but

00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,390
that's certainly another area where we

00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:10,770
think there is a huge potential for

00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:12,780
commercial open source now I'm gonna

00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,880
wrap and hopefully open up for

00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,950
since if there are any that's where we

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,280
has a foundation come in and that's

00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:22,410
where the shameless plug comes in what

00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:26,310
do we do as a foundation well this is

00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:28,710
our programs I'm happy to go in detail

00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:31,500
but programs are nothing more the

00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:34,950
collections of open source projects or

00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,290
open standards working groups it's

00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:41,490
really contain the Matic containers

00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:44,220
around certain specific areas of

00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:47,640
financial services now one thing that I

00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:50,520
want to say is this is our financial

00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:54,050
delivery accelerator program you've seen

00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:56,670
the curve of maturity I showed before I

00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:58,470
don't want to paint a happy picture here

00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,750
there's certainly a lot of firms who are

00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:03,570
still in the early days of their

00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:05,370
maturity in open source and so that's

00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:10,400
why we call this our foundational

00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:12,840
programs we help not only with education

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,220
firms to get to the point that not only

00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:18,660
they can consume but they can also

00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:20,850
contribute to open source firm wide but

00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,280
most importantly we pair up firms with

00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:27,090
each other like it's much more powerful

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,160
for the compliance guy at JPMorgan to

00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:31,050
hear it from the compliance guy at

00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,760
Goldman Sachs rather than me telling

00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:34,380
them how they should be doing open

00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,350
source that's something that they

00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,400
extremely value so I want to say if

00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,320
you're working for a financial

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,910
institutions and you're not yet defined

00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,130
you're like wow this is impossible I'm

00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:47,310
never gonna be able to get my boss to

00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:49,200
contribute this well that's where we can

00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:51,090
help in terms of education if you're

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,220
ready great jump in any of these

00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:55,080
programs it's open you don't need to pay

00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:57,360
this is an open source foundation of

00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:01,410
course we'd love yours members as paying

00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:04,680
members but entry is open for everyone

00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:07,520
but if you're not there yet come and

00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,960
talk to us anyway we can help your firm

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,030
and pair up you know the legal people

00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,950
with the legal people exactly this with

00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:15,690
the executives we can help being your

00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:20,250
advocates within the firm for open

00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:22,680
source one way that we do that is by

00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:26,400
also providing the CIC D pipeline for

00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:28,650
our community we soon realized that

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,140
you know one of our deficient shaders

00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:33,630
should be hey sure you can do open

00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,880
source out there but if you consume open

00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:39,150
source from Finas you'll know that it's

00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,660
IP clean that is secure that is

00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:44,160
compliant and so we have put in place

00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:47,910
you know wide search for security

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:52,350
validation we have our own CLA bot to

00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:56,220
manage contributor license agreements we

00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:58,800
obviously deploy out there to maven NPM

00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:02,370
you'll get and all the different sort of

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:07,140
namespaces under the Finas namespace and

00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:08,760
so really on one hand this is the CI CD

00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,920
pipeline for our community on the other

00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,270
hand hopefully it can become a reference

00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,680
architecture for how firms internally

00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:18,810
contribute and consume to open-source I

00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,030
mean some firms as I said they have this

00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:23,010
infrastructure some others this is a

00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:25,350
really good learning experience for them

00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:32,070
as they move into the digital

00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:36,960
transformation and so wrapping up I'm

00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:38,790
strangely on time this is the call to

00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,940
action I mean if you are an individual

00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,560
if you are in if these convinced here

00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,780
that open source is possible in

00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,770
financial services please come talk to

00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,420
us we are at both 82 again this is an

00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,370
open source community there is no price

00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,060
tag attached to it I'm not selling you

00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:58,190
anything

00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,190
of course if you are a company instead

00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:05,280
we certainly can help you both as a

00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:07,410
contributor it is a participant or as a

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,150
member we obviously have the capacity of

00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:11,190
doing a little more for you and be

00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,710
proactive and come in you know pair up

00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:15,690
our lawyer with your with your internal

00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:19,710
compliance people and and get people

00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:24,180
through the hump it's a complex problem

00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:26,220
of aligning culture legal technology and

00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,900
really the business understanding of why

00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:34,019
they should be doing open source

00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:34,019
