Abstract: Nebula is a scalable overlay networking tool with a focus on performance, simplicity and security. It lets you seamlessly connect computers anywhere in the world. Nebula is portable, and runs on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, and Android. In this workshop, we will stand up a Nebula mesh (it really is quite easy), but also deep dive into performance, security, and general connectivity tuning, all while sharing anecdotes and lessons we have learned from running Nebula on 20,000+ servers at Slack, and on our own personal networks.
