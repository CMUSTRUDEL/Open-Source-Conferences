	00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,600
and

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,679
indeed we are going to talk about the

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,880
open source software licenses

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,160
business models i'll also cover uh

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,640
a bit of open source uh history

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,320
but before that i wanted to maybe say

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,240
why am i

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,000
talking uh about uh about this

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,599
right so at uh percona

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,399
uh we release all our software as an

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,520
uh open source and we have and while we

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,559
are focused on

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,600
open source databases ourselves

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,879
uh we are very much uh

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,760
focused and passionate about the open

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,360
source

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,480
software in uh in general

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,760
uh and i have been now

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,039
in the uh open source ecosystem for

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,399
uh about uh 20 years uh

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,439
looking how things uh unfold uh change

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,960
for better or worse and uh

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,280
so on and so forth right and i think i

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,040
have seen a lot of things being kind of

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,759
uh successful and not so successful

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
and that is what i am going to share

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,799
with you today

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,920
so we'll start with some uh

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,640
some history of the

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,119
open source software which i think many

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,720
people

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,759
do not really recognize

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,960
their open source uh really uh

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,240
come from and really how old

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,280
uh it is now if you go

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,720
in the early days of uh

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:51,200
uh computing

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,920
and computers the hardware and software

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,399
bundled right because where all the

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,840
whole

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,240
hardware was so dispersed and different

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,799
and unique the software was really

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,840
written specifically to work for

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,520
uh that uh hardware

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,800
and was not really useful

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,640
outside of it the source code was

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,080
shipped with that earlier software

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,680
also because a lot of early computers

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,720
were used by early adopters and those

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,200
really wanted to

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,280
modify the code themselves to fix bugs

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,080
and maybe you know add functionality

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,080
which they need and also because many of

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,640
those early adopters were

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:42,720
in an academia space like university uh

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,160
a lot shared in that space

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,160
according to the academic principle of

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,360
sharing knowledge

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,879
then the 17 comes

00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,239
uh and in this case

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,440
we see what software

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,640
and the hardware get unbundled

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,080
some of that is coming from the uh

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,200
anti-trust uh lawsuit what uh

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
was against the ibm uh at that time

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,200
which kind of

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,800
for you know forced them to

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,599
do something to uh kind of break their

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,560
monopoly

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,239
uh essentially right and have a more

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,360
level playing field for

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,959
uh for our competition another

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
interesting thing which was happening at

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,080
that time is what computer software

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,560
becomes copyrightable item

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,280
right now it is kind of strange to

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,480
imagine

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
anything else because software is such a

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,959
major class

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,319
of intellectual property for many

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:54,000
you know darlings right imagine apple or

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:58,000
amazon facebook right without copyright

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,120
for uh their software as an

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,959
as an ip right but really before

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,840
that uh that time the computer software

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,400
was not

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,720
uh copyrightable item right so

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,239
because on this you know selected list

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,199
of items for

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,239
uh copyrightable and as a software was

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,600
added to that

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,360
at least when we essentially uh

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,680
have a multi-billion dollar

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,199
uh maybe you know trillion dollar plus

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,880
uh by now

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:36,160
uh software industry was created

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,360
as i see things moving forward uh

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
in 80s and 19s i will call that an era

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,840
of

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,560
romantic open source and uh free

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,280
software right this is uh ritual

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,720
stallman

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,800
uh one of the champions of

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,160
of uh that era and that was

00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,720
i think a lot based on the uh

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,320
sort of you know romantic view of how

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,680
open source software can

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,360
change world uh right if you uh

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,080
here uh maybe you may heard a quote from

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,000
leno storwaltz from about the same time

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,680
who was talking about why he created

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,960
linux well

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,440
just for fun right uh other people may

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,680
be talking hey you know what we just

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,080
had our own each to scratch and that's

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,720
how we create open source software

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,520
and so on and so forth right so at that

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
time

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,080
the open source was uh relatively niche

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,120
and was not really looked at as a

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,320
major uh mainstream right and a major

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,240
business

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:48,320
now if you look at uh 2000s

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,800
we see really rise of open source

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,000
er not exactly at the state of

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,639
domination it is right

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,280
now but as a serious player and we can

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,919
see that

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,720
recognized by microsoft at that time

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,000
where

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,440
steve walner was calling

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
linux a cancer uh writer comparing

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,759
linux to cancer at that time and i

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,639
really like this quote

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,840
in particular because uh it's also a

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,720
great illustration

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,440
about how things change with time right

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,680
you can

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,880
uh probably see now with purchase of a

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
github and in

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,160
general uh you know their positions now

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,199
uh microsoft is all in on

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,199
on supporting open source right uh how

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:39,680
things can change in 20 years

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:42,720
uh we also have a open source big exit

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,960
with sun acquiring mysql for

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,080
what looked at that time as a huge

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,039
amount of money

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,639
the billion dollars right which was

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,520
another recognition for open source

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,800
software

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,240
before that uh the only

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:03,039
uh successful open source company at

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,520
that scale which kind of survived dot

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,240
was a red hat right and it's always good

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,440
to see

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,160
uh what uh something is not just you

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,840
know

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,639
one time accident but as a business

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,199
model or can be successfully

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,160
repeated of course now billion dollars

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,199
doesn't really

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,160
surprise anyone right there are many

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,560
uh open source and related companies

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,759
which

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,000
uh fetch many billion dollars uh

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,759
evaluation but at that time while that

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,680
was a big news

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,039
what also was happening at that time is

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,919
what we see

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,120
increasing the amount of corporation

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,360
understanding

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,840
the value of the open source the

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,479
strategic value

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,440
of uh of an open source right and we

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,280
still

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,319
see uh the open source

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,120
test approach starts to be forming right

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,240
both by

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,639
enterprises and also some uh governments

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
which

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,000
uh start to say hey you know what uh

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,440
it's

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,280
going to be better for all of us if we

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,160
uh run on open source versus uh uh

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,280
versus commercial uh commercial software

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,720
right where

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,319
uh we are uh well

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,599
beholden to the commercial company

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,800
and also which is controlled uh

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,080
well in many cases right by uh

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,159
the foreign entity right or foreign

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,000
government in terms of laws policies and

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,839
so on and so forth

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,320
now if you look from the business

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,159
standpoint

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,279
uh the approach to open source was not

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,399
romantic anymore right it's not

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,279
just about hey you know what's the open

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,320
source

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:58,160
makes the grand grass grow greener

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,120
it is more about

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,320
their cost and efficiency and if you

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,000
look in this case the

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,200
open source for business lowers cost

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,959
short term and long term right that is

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,800
direct lower cost because

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:18,160
open source software they're typically

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,200
a lower cost than commercial

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,560
software i'm not saying zero cost

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,000
because it is not

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,600
right because uh while the source code

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,320
uh uh right of open source software

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,160
is free right and maybe there may be not

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,279
a license to pay

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,040
really running software and customizing

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,399
that for your needs and so on and so

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,800
forth that is

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
not three and not three right but cost

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,640
often can be lower

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,279
also for years we can see what the

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,000
engineering engineers preferences

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,200
availability was getting better and

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,120
better for

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,279
for open source right you would

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,959
find engineers preferring to work with

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,360
open source software

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,640
uh rather than commercial we also see a

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,279
better productivity

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,640
because if you can see the source code

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,800
you actually can

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,640
sell help much better understand how

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,399
software works much better and so on and

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,600
so forth which in the end

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,959
means that you have a faster innovation

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,480
right then compared with uh open so with

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,760
property software and

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,720
also avoiding software uh

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,320
vendor locking which is uh which is a

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,800
big

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
uh thing for many businesses especially

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,240
those who have

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,040
been there for a long time and they can

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,279
understand how the licensing policies of

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,120
a vendor can change

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:49,279
right and often not to your

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,839
customers uh benefit you know it's like

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,480
uh in computing and computers everything

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,279
gets

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
uh cheaper all the time right but only

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,600
if there is enough

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:05,279
uh competition to uh to support that

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,320
so uh this also changed how open source

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,640
uh was uh uh approached

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
right as a lot of enterprises start to

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,640
uh look at value

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,600
open source then we also see the new

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
generation of

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,519
open source founders which are starting

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,880
the companies

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,079
as a business first not with romantic

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,519
ideas about the uh open source uh you

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,320
know changing walls

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,640
and not just for fun but really because

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,480
that

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:37,680
is a great uh business right

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,880
and there is a potential to

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,560
build a company more successful company

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,600
realize some value and so on and so

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,720
forth

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,640
because of that also a lot of those of a

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,639
new generation companies very venture

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,560
funded and if that

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,880
means that you need to provide the high

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,880
returns and relatively fast

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,279
right because venture funding does not

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,399
go

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,360
in the uh companies which expect to go

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,160
to grow you know free x for five years

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,560
right i mean

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,440
the venture capital typically expects at

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,639
least

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,680
uh you know 10x returned from you

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,800
uh in in a few years so you really need

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,560
to

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,920
grow fast or fail fast if you can't

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,160
what that came is to the situation where

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,959
first the attractive messaging of open

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,240
source is realized because

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,839
uh you know everybody uh

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,240
in the business understands so the open

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,279
source is better but at the same time

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,800
those needs to be merged somehow

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:46,320
with foundational principles of building

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,200
successful uh growing scalable business

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,839
right like hey how we can build monopoly

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,120
avoid competition

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,279
commoditization increased stickiness

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,639
have our

00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,800
anti-competitive modes and so on and so

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,720
forth right all the stuff you can hear

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,959
in a business school and i think what is

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,880
interesting here is what you can find

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,560
what a lot of those

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,839
really go a lot in the

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:16,160
uh in the conflict with that

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:19,279
traditional uh romantic open source

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,639
software uh software values well what

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,680
also created

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,320
is number of business models

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,800
right which go around open source and

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,120
often use open source for

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,000
marketing but not completely open source

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,560
you know such as

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,360
open core software open source

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,680
eventually

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,000
shared service licenses open source

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,199
compatible software

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,720
and so on and so forth right

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,920
and with that not quite

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,240
open source software

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,839
we have sort of both positive and

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,639
negatives coming in right

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,600
because from positive we have a lot of

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,519
investment

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,160
going on in the technology around

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,920
open source right and really we have a

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,639
very high pace of innovation

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,240
right i mean as especially with space

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,040
and very close to the open source

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
databases

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,160
it is actually phenomenal so many

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,279
companies are

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,760
doing so much

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,959
cool stuff now and at least part of that

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,480
innovation is

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,639
uh is open source but also that's quite

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,120
not quite open source software

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,160
doesn't provide all values truly open

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,360
source software

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,600
software provides and you need to know

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,880
that

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,079
now in 2010s and

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,680
later we have another important impact

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:51,519
for open source software is rays

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,959
of the race of the clouds

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:58,880
the cloud was started in

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:02,079
2000s right aws was founded in 2006

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,079
right but it is

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,760
not until i think uh 2010s

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,800
that it really becomes de facto standard

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,519
for running

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,760
your systems and it's really starting to

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,600
impact the open source

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:21,600
in a big deal right and that comes

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,880
with challenges and opportunities for

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,519
for open source software i think one

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,199
thing which is

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:32,639
very interesting what cloud broke it

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,519
allowed to hijack the gpl license

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,279
right before the cloud the open source

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,399
companies could use the gpl

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:43,680
as uh as we'll talk later

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:47,519
which is uh uh the

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,440
copy left right or uh restrictive uh

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,800
license which really means

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,160
if you want to base their commercial

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,600
software

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,560
right on uh on the gpl software

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,880
you can't really do that right you need

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,839
to open source derived work and that

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
means

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,759
uh what if you want to do that

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,160
you'll come to copyright holder and ask

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,920
them

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,279
for another license write the

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,839
commercial license and pay for that

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:27,360
for example mysql very successfully used

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,480
their um do a license model

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,639
right to deal with that but

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,600
that is not required in the cloud right

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,320
amazon

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,560
for example is able to uh have something

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,000
like amazon aurora which is uh

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,160
truly derived worked off for mysql which

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,560
oracle works copyrights on

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,360
we found be required to pay to oracle

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,320
for that

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
right so that's really a shake to the

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,800
core

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,160
at least some of the open source

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,160
business model

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,079
another thing which is interesting here

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,279
is what we have a great

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,559
uh rebundling right uh previously

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,199
we would buy the hardware where we buy

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,079
it or

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,240
lease this server in a data center uh it

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,160
would separate from a software so

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,120
software costs are very visible if i am

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,360
you know buying oracle database to run

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,079
right i see those costs separately and

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
then will be

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,679
different budget in case all right and

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,679
then

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:30,880
open source uh comes with a fantastic

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,360
you know price of zero right at least to

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,320
uh to get started that is not the case

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,600
in the cloud

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,200
in the cloud you always pay for

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,559
uh usage right and wherever it is uh

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,760
i don't say uh one dollar for

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,640
an hour right for your uh

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,120
you know just linux box right or two

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,160
dollars an hour when it runs some

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,200
uh proper database right well

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,760
it is uh uh much more

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:07,039
hidden and there is no more zero prices

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,840
effect which is a powerful psychological

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,080
effect which draws how humans are

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,760
attracted to free stuff

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,360
right and i think that's one of

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:20,400
important drivers of the open source

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,840
uh success right now

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,039
as we come to the 1020s uh we come to

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,160
the future and

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,880
it is kind of difficult to make accurate

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,080
predictions

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,600
uh about the futures as uh

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,720
some wise men uh said

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:42,240
at the same time i think it is uh

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,520
uh uh interesting uh to see what there

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,559
is a great momentum

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,440
happening rao for commercial open source

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,360
software

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,880
i mentioned in the early on in this

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,720
presentation what's

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:58,559
the billion bucks what a mysql sold

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,679
that is not really

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,720
uh meaningful right those days it's

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,919
uh right very uh

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,080
you know quite uh quite

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,000
not quite small those days because there

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,200
are many companies

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,960
in this case these are in

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,440
you know valued at the uh

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
in a you know many billions dollars

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
right sometimes

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,640
more or tens of billions of dollars

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,000
another interesting thing

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,600
uh which i think is happening right now

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,600
is what we have uh pandemic

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,240
obviously and this is

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,120
very interesting what it has been

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,120
causing the

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,000
acceleration of digital transformation

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,039
in many cases

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,640
at the same time us needs to cut the

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,760
cost right or at least

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,760
prevent them from going up uh that

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
quickly and i think that was very good

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,120
for

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,160
uh open source just a few days ago this

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,159
interesting article

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,520
came out on zero net which i like the

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,000
title of that what

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,200
open source goes up when a company

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,320
economy goes down

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,960
right of course we don't want the

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,880
economy goes down or uh

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,799
people uh dying right as happens with a

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,240
coveted 19 right and other

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,240
horrendous effects but

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:28,799
those things nasty uh that tend to also

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,480
uh speed up open source uh

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:35,760
adoption and especially in

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,799
uh unlikely places and

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,159
i will uh finish it off with my uh

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,799
belief uh right what i think what trend

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,960
which will

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:50,240
continue is what no one uh wants to be

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,360
a hostage nobody wants to be kind of

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,559
subject to

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,240
uh vendor lock-in right because uh

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:02,080
even if it's not very painful short-term

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:06,480
then that tends to be uh more painful

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:09,520
as a time goes on right so

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,400
over long term increasing amount of

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,000
uh smart strategic thinkers i will

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,679
continue to be choosing the

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
open source software

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,960
okay any thoughts questions

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,360
disagreements on this section

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,840
anyone i don't see anything in chat or q

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,840
a

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,240
yeah i think participants can post your

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,400
questions in three ways

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,360
you can use the chat the zoom chat

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,440
feature or you can use the q a feature

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,720
or you can raise your hands and i can

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,400
unmute you to ask a question

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,960
and that was a great talk peter thank

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,120
you thank you for the wonderful talk

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,200
okay okay well the talk is not ended yet

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,120
it's just the section

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,480
yeah i think it has one more part that's

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,559
coming up in another

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:06,320
15 minutes okay

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:09,600
okay so uh uh anyway so

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,159
uh as we review the history i wanted to

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,240
talk

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:17,760
about the open source and

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,360
and you right and uh specifically

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,720
what your goals being involved with

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,440
open source are right and i think that

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,720
is uh

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,440
uh important before we go to a section

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,520
and start

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,320
uh talking about choosing a business

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,080
model and so on and so forth because

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,880
uh your goals may not require that

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,840
right now you may be involved with open

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,880
source

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,520
you know just for fun or to make a

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,000
career

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,960
right i mean open source contributor

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
right and

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,240
especially being creator of some open

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,640
source project really

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,039
can be do wonders for your uh

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,559
for your career even if you do not

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,960
monetize it directly

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,159
maybe you are building something to make

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,520
a difference right and

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,360
building a business uh of your open

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,880
source

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:16,720
uh project is only

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,039
one of the goals all right you may have

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,840
uh also i think it's a good question to

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,360
uh

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,520
ask

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,520
in

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:37,679
in this case is

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:41,360
about their

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,799
about what your goals with uh

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,400
uh with a project uh oh

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:52,000
is uh wherever you are working oops

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,240
sorry you know god distracted the origin

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,520
and

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,320
uh the chat not very good trying to

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,320
multitask

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,320
okay so um

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,840
the other thing i would consider right

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,880
if there's an existing project or you're

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,320
thinking to

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,440
uh uh to create one right

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,200
uh as i uh spoke in the historical

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,240
section right then

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,840
where people uh in the first stages they

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
often would you know just create a

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,200
project coming

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:26,559
out of a need right in uh

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,520
in the uh motor age some people say hey

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,440
you know what

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,559
i think it would be great for me to

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,720
start the open source business i'm just

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,880
don't know about what right and then

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,640
maybe i will do some market research to

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,520
see the things which doesn't exist and

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,799
then

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,000
only start uh open source

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:49,520
project and now if think which is

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,279
very good to consider is this kind of

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:57,520
difference between the open source

00:24:53,279 --> 00:25:01,760
project and the open source

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,440
uh product right some people use those

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,720
terms

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,240
interchargeably but i think there is a

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,279
very important

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,240
difference between those two because

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,919
any code on a github git lab right or

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,440
wherever could it be called the

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,120
open source open source project

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,480
right of course what i think is

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,120
interesting is what the many

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,520
open source projects are or at least can

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,760
be

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,720
focused on their developer right or

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,279
developers

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,240
right often you would talk to those guys

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,880
and they will tell you well you know

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,640
what

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,919
what i want from this open source

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,799
projects and do

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,679
x y and z i am writing on those things

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,000
because they

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,000
are interesting for me that is what i am

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,480
choosing to support or do

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,120
and i don't really uh care so much about

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,039
about users right because that product

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,919
is for me i'm just sharing that and take

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,320
it uh

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,520
or leave it right again not all open

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,159
source projects

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,440
are this way and actually many

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,200
successful ones

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,000
are not right but as a project

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,679
uh running a project as developer you

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
have a full right to be

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:14,799
uh to be uh selfish

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,919
right oh they also may not care so much

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,080
about the documentation comparability qa

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,679
and so on and so forth some developers

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,559
just you know write to

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,760
uh write the code and hey you know what

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,440
if that's a baby

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,960
they have all the documentation they

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,559
need in their

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,360
in their head their user and customer

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,640
support also maybe

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,039
uh miss uh hit or miss right again some

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,279
people

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,559
are very passionate about helping user

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,720
to be successful

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,559
other would say well you know what if

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,600
you can figure it out then you are

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:53,120
stupid uh too stupid to use my

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,320
uh product object so go away

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,960
now if you are making a

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,640
product commitment right then that means

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,880
many of those change

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,120
uh have to change at least if you want

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,320
your product to be actually successful

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,080
as a product

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,000
right you need for example to have a

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,360
very clear licenses you know just

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,080
hey this stuff on a github would not

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,360
cut it you would need to make sure that

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,799
the life cycle

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:24,080
comparability upgrade path is uh

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,200
uh very clear as well right because your

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,279
users

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
are especially serious or android are

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,640
going to define

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,840
rely on that and mainly will make a

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,279
commitment

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,279
for your product for many

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,799
years or even decades if they include

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,720
that in their software

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,919
many would also make sure you provide

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,039
builds packages

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,799
make your project accessible highways

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,279
maybe on some marketplaces

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,919
and so on and so forth documentation

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,320
becomes

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,600
critical right you will have to find a

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,960
way how you

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,360
uh support the end users right wherever

00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,840
as a

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,600
free or commercial you know people will

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,480
report bugs or have some problems they

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,120
need and so on and so forth security

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,080
issues

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,039
remediation becomes uh very important

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,760
especially

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,679
you know those days where we hear so

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,240
many news about

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,799
companies you know constantly being

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,320
hacked

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,399
right and at the same time they really

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,720
don't want to uh

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,399
be the news right and you probably also

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,279
don't want to

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,120
uh want your product uh being out there

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,000
in the news as a reason

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,279
you know some huge company got hacked

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,320
and then i would say

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,200
bill uh millions uh billions right the

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,200
user

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,399
uh password release and so on and so

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,520
forth right and

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:47,520
you also of course need uh to have a

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,399
you know great quality assurance to

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,399
support all of that

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,600
okay let's see

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,520
so uh yeah so the question is about

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,279
client clear lessons about

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:07,120
licensing fuses so packages too

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:09,840
uh yes uh i think uh

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,039
that is something which you would uh uh

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,320
you better have

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:18,399
right or it will uh especially for

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:22,000
larger customers it will uh

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,640
uh it will float right to the problem

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,640
now

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:30,159
what is interesting also is uh you may

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:34,559
not need that if you have a right to

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:37,840
uh re-license the code right uh

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,080
uh for example if you look at uh

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,279
mysql which is saying hey everything

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,480
that there is mysql server is gpl

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:49,600
in fact it includes inside

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,399
some of you know bsd

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,679
and other libraries which are compatible

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,360
with gpn

00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:01,279
gpl in a sense when a whole work

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:04,080
can be uh uh can be

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,919
licensed as gpl in other cases like for

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,399
example if you look at the

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,080
you know linux distributions uh and

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,200
others you may often have different

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,120
packages coming

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,559
you know with different licenses right

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,399
and in this case

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:22,159
uh yes you better to have that

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,600
uh that clear okay uh peter i think you

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,159
have one more question in the q and a

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,480
section

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,440
the question is uh what were the four

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,200
business models

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,320
uh in the slide that you showed like uh

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,840
uh open source eventually and

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,679
things like that you should have yes

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,760
yeah uh well

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:45,039
so this is from philip yes

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,080
thank you for flagging that for me so uh

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,320
philip uh i just uh got to use that

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,440
very freaking quickly for historical

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,120
review

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,159
uh in uh in that case uh

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,039
but i will talk more specifically at the

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,399
business model

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,880
at the later session of this

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,559
presentation right including those four

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,720
can you also flash this light for a

00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,360
minute uh peter maybe that's

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,240
that could help him oh that's a slide i

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,399
think that's a

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,840
slight about business model that was

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,000
quite a while ago but again

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,519
i will get we'll get to that right i'm

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,840
not going to okay yeah

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:25,039
scroll back to that again okay so

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,880
anyway the main point here i am

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:32,320
uh looking to make is uh what

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,360
not every developer right really

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,240
is interested in my experience in

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,039
turning their open source project in in

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,000
the product

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,320
right as you talk to them and explain it

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
many will find the task

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,480
daunting right and um

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,760
uh they're not even doing that

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,440
themselves

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,760
or uh building a team which does it

00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,120
uh for them right because as you build

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,559
an open source business you don't have

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,360
to do anything right that somebody has

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,360
to

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,200
right but i think it's

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,799
something else which is very interesting

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,279
to consider here right

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,320
uh you may choose not to focus on

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,720
building a

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,720
building a company and a product right

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,320
around your open source project

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,679
but also mind what if your

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,039
project going to be very successful

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,320
then somebody else will do that right so

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:35,279
uh interesting um example for exa

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,760
in open source database space would be

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,120
uh

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,519
would be radius right there uh salvatore

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,679
san felipe he

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,519
you know for a year didn't want really

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,279
to build a big business a product around

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,080
registrar that was you know wonderful

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,720
very much loved open source projects

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,720
right

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,720
then you would see uh ready slabs and

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,480
some other companies when they had to

00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
build the business around it because

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,720
well

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,840
uh there was uh uh was attraction

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,120
and uh and there

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,720
and the opportunities right linux is uh

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,840
also another example right there uh

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,480
the other companies build uh uh products

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,919
uh

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,600
and big businesses around uh linux where

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:27,039
uh lino storals uh choose

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,880
not to do it uh not to do it directly

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,600
right and i think it turned out uh

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,279
pretty well both for linux and

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,320
uh and salvatore right in uh

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:41,039
in this case uh right

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,240
i feel it's uh maybe you know different

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,799
if they would

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:50,799
uh run their own business

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:54,320
so yeah okay

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:58,159
with that we are moving on to the

00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:02,000
open source business

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,679
models and if it's a thing i wanted to

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,040
to say what uh you should

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:12,800
look at business model

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:15,280
first and the license second

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,320
because depending on what your business

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,359
models

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,919
are uh you will

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,000
need to see what license choices are

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:29,119
going to be able to

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,159
support that

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,599
uh with this i want to quote

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,720
this man martin mikus he was the

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:44,000
uh ceo of uh

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,000
mysql uh and uh he's a ceo of

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,200
hacker one uh and i think he's one of

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,159
his

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,800
great thought leaders when it comes to

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,919
the

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,399
open source monetization

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:59,839
and one a great quote you said is what

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,119
the open source is not a business model

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:06,240
then you say well if that is

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,839
not the business model then

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,480
what open source is

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,079
well the open source can be seen as your

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,040
development model

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,920
you know distribution model uh right but

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,000
uh

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,160
and you can of cour and many complaints

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,599
of course build models around

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,880
or open source but itself open source

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,200
does not specifically

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,440
prescribe you uh particular

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,560
business model now what is also

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,079
interesting is

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,280
what you do not have to have both

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,680
open source development model and

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,560
the distribution model you will find of

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,040
course many

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,320
uh many projects which really are

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,480
successful because

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,400
it is kind of a whole community

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,560
which builds them and contributes you

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,000
know think about linux or postgres or

00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,920
kubernetes and so on and so

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,760
forth but another company which i

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,359
mentioned the slide is a very

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:09,359
successful one uh mongodb

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,200
right is using open source as

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:14,400
distribution strategy

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,240
right but not

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,760
really as uh development right this is a

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,800
quote from their

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,240
uh ceo interview which

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,720
pretty much says hey you know what

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,599
mongodb was built by mongodb

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,079
we didn't really intended to get any

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,640
help from community we just

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,280
uh look at that as a freemium strategy

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,040
read

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,079
well open source is great for

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,119
for distribution so let's

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,119
look at those uh things what open source

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,560
really provides right i think the value

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,760
what open source

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,599
provides which you cannot or do not get

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,800
exactly the same way

00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:00,079
with the property software

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,960
one is open source distribution model

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,000
obviously you uh there are additional

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,720
channels

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,480
of distribution open source which are

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,640
not as easy for

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,079
commercial products right for example

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,560
there is a github

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,320
where a lot of people can find cool open

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,040
source projects right and start using

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,640
them

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,160
you can also potentially have your

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,599
project includes in the distributions

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:28,960
right i think especially for

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,079
in the early days uh uh getting includes

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,560
that in one of the linux distributions

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,000
was

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,400
absolutely you know a fantastic way

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,760
to get uh some good adoption traction

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,960
for linux

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,640
for your open source project uh also you

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,839
could be distributed as a part of the

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,880
other project

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,960
right you would often see

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,720
people taking the open source projects

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,560
and including them

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,160
in their open source project and for

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,200
that drive in

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,040
more use and adoption for uh your

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,440
product of course that's also possible

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,440
with

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,720
uh with a commercial software but you

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,119
would need to

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,839
you know negotiate right sign the

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,800
license

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,560
blah blah blah so it's you know much

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,839
more

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,400
friction if you look at

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,640
open source development model it also

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,599
comes with a lot of

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,400
value if you look at the many successful

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,720
open source

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,800
projects we have fantastic code

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,440
contributions right that means not just

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,200
you but somebody else is working

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,640
okay well it looks it's uh it's a time

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,760
to continue

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,960
so uh i ended the last uh

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,920
part by uh talking what if you you're

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,320
looking to

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,079
build a business it's good to figure out

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,400
what kind of business you really

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,280
look at and that may land somewhere

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,040
between

00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,240
you know two opposites uh kind of bigger

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:03,599
exits versus

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,960
uh looking to just build a uh

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,440
sort of lifestyle for yourself and

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,400
uh maybe a few friends if you look at

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,640
the uh

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,320
big exit what that defines that means

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,920
that you'll have to have a

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,920
you know product uh focus business

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,359
right that means uh what you are really

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,520
creating an ip

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,800
around the uh software products right

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,839
you are really

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,599
building that anti-competitive modes me

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:37,200
uh right making sure what you are

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,440
uh well really

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,800
can provide something exclusively right

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,599
with customers for

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,440
what your competition cannot be you

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,520
really need to obsessive scaling you

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,800
know thinking how the company can

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,720
uh go for you know from

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,480
you know no revenue to million 10

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,160
million 100 million revenue and so on

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,680
and so forth right uh

00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,960
and what that means is uh uh open so

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,520
raising uh capital right venture capital

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,560
uh

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:10,400
is uh uh very often

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,920
required in uh in this case like for

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,720
example all the companies

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,280
on the list i mentioned they ended up

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,119
raising

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,640
a lot of tens and hundreds of millions

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,200
of venture

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,640
capital and what happens also in this

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,599
case is what

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,480
open source also takes uh takes a

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,160
backseat

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,520
right because in this case this is a

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,640
business first

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,680
right and the fact it's via is

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,839
built around open source is second right

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,839
and that is i think the last piece is

00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,319
why you would see some of the

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,040
open source project founders didn't want

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,520
to

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,200
fully jump on that kind of vc trail with

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,280
their project because

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:54,480
uh in this case they felt what they will

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,839
have to be focused too much

00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,079
on making money and not as much

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,440
about making a difference and providing

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,319
the value for project

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,760
users right if that is more of a

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,040
lifestyle business

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,680
then uh that can be service business or

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,680
it can be

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,599
service product too right in this case

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,119
you will have a pressure you can

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,560
proceed on your own pace and on your own

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,760
terms

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,240
it is uh easy to focus

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,960
uh on the open source in this case right

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,640
you can find

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,720
many of the smaller businesses can say

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:34,079
hey you know what we are

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,079
uh contributing 100

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,520
our staff as an open source at some very

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,960
uh permissive license and we are

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,079
essentially doing some sort of

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,040
some sort of uh consulting right and

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,040
it's also

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:58,079
a lot easier to to bootstrap

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,839
right like in this case uh because you

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,119
can often start service

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,599
revenue by just doing it yourself often

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,560
you can even start by doing that or part

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,680
time while

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,960
holding to your kind of main

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,680
main job right and that doesn't require

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,599
a lot of

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:20,880
capital right one thing i think it's uh

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,359
very interesting when it comes to open

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,440
source

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:29,599
uh business built around open source

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:33,119
is those concepts of distribution

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,960
and monetization right if you think

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,520
about the distribution focus

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,680
right this is something about how can we

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,200
grow a number of users of your open

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,319
source software

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:47,680
as quickly as possible

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:51,760
and then monetization focus

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,400
is okay how can we get

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,000
as many of us users to become customers

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,760
right and

00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,200
paying customers right what i mean what

00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,319
i mean in this case and

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,319
also increasing the amount of each size

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:10,240
such customers pay right

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:13,599
so and uh those two

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:16,960
they really uh come uh

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,839
in a conflict right like uh for example

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,000
you can think about

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,200
amazon every asset saying hey that thing

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,760
is uh

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,680
great for growing number of mysql users

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,000
but that is not so great for oracle

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,040
trying

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,240
to monetize mysql because well amazon is

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,760
monetizing them

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,000
in this case not not oracle

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,880
what is also that means interesting is

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,319
that is how

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,640
many many open source projects they sort

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,839
of

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,880
change in their evolution right like

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,880
for example uh if you look at a database

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,359
space you can take a look at

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,800
mongodb as this very sort of

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,760
quintessential example

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,800
when they started all the features were

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,960
open source

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,800
under the gpl license right and it

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,560
looked like uh

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,920
what everything is is going to be

00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,280
but then after mongodb reached critical

00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,720
mass

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:16,079
then they

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,000
shifted adding some features as

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,960
enterprise only features right in the

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,800
commercial software and then later on

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,119
abandoning an open source license all

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,800
together and going to source available

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:32,720
license to increase monetization and to

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,760
uh protect uh their turf right from

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,480
uh from competition right because

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,119
at that point that was more important

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,720
than

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:46,560
uh getting as much growth as possible

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,280
right and if they would start the same

00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,319
way

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,520
uh as we are right now

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:57,200
chances are they wouldn't be

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,359
able to get uh the same

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,240
traction as quickly and you can see that

00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,359
repeated by

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,160
many many smaller uh organizations as

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,480
well

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:11,520
okay so let us look at the

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:15,119
open source business models right

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,359
and i will uh talk about those

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,880
uh business models in a little bit

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,720
different words right then i mentioned

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,400
like an open source source available

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,640
right because that was kind of

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,760
business model more classified but what

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,040
kind of license

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,440
you use right and this is not complete

00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,480
list

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,119
of uh business models for open source

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,240
software right you can uh check the

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,520
wikipedia link

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,079
for example to find probably about 10

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,280
more

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:46,560
more exotic models and i don't think

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:50,160
even wikipedia is complete here but

00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,359
uh you know if you are really looking at

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:56,720
at the business you would

00:45:53,359 --> 00:46:00,079
look at uh

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,000
probably something along those now what

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,040
is also

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,760
good to point out here is what not all

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,960
uh it is not about picking one of your

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,319
open source for

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,760
those models or you may actually be

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:18,960
uh having multiple uh

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:23,040
models at the same time

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:26,720
right i know no i know what percona does

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,520
so it is not single choice

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,839
but more of a multiple choice answer

00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,599
though

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,520
typically most companies will choose to

00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,000
focus on one or maybe you know two

00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,119
different

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,240
business models the most okay so if you

00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,520
think about the

00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,400
services such as a consultant

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,119
or customer engineering right also

00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,640
referred

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,400
us as you know sponsored features

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,440
sometimes it is

00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,319
relatively easy uh to get to

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,319
right like as i mentioned if you have a

00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:59,119
services model that's often you can just

00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:01,520
do it yourself part-time first until you

00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,800
get enough business to

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,880
uh get more more people right if that's

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,240
how you choose to start the change in

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,440
that is what

00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,040
the margin is relatively low right in

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,240
terms of what's uh

00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,160
if it is sort of like uh you know

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,480
consulting right for example typically

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,599
there are sort of you know prevailing

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,079
uh market rates right and people are not

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,920
going

00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:30,319
to uh you know pay you you know too much

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,680
more than that right so the difference

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,640
between how much

00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,359
you can essentially or make us would

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,240
have to pay

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,920
to somebody to to work for you right and

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,680
how much you can charge your customers

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,960
that different is not the difference is

00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,280
not huge

00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,359
uh that revenue is also not recurring

00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,000
right that means what you'll often

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:53,680
have to invest a lot of times in

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,319
marketing and sales to get those uh

00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,280
uh those projects you know sometimes you

00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,720
may get lucky

00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:04,880
and land some

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:09,200
you know long-term consulting projects

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:12,079
for uh for yourself but those things are

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,359
again harder uh hard to scale right you

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,280
have a team of people

00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,559
ensuring all the fama staffed on the

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,079
long-term projects

00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:22,079
uh is a is not easy uh and a

00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,040
and the fad is hard to scale right

00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:28,160
because if consulting you scale by

00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,040
delivering hours right or building the

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,720
code

00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,800
uh you have to hire a lot of

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,720
you know bright engineers to do that

00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,760
which is uh

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:44,559
which is tough the next model

00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:48,960
is around support at managed services

00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:52,720
is uh is a little bit different

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,599
right and uh it's worth to note what

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,920
some people

00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,960
have consulting and they essentially

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,200
call that support

00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,599
management services saying hey well uh

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,359
you know what you have a problem you can

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,880
call us and we'll charge you

00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:12,880
for you know two hours so how how long

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,880
it took us to figure out a problem

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,640
and that's it right that is not what i

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,280
call uh support here

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,400
what i call support managed services is

00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,319
when you have

00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:27,760
a subscription right you charge folks

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,640
so many uh you know dollars per instance

00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,920
per cpu

00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:35,119
right or whatever model is appear here

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,160
right and then they reach you out when

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,040
you have a problem or

00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,640
or something like that in this case that

00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,520
creates your predictable recurrent

00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,880
revenue which is

00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:47,520
very important for growing the company

00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,040
generally it gives a better margin

00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,880
especially for

00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:56,319
support it's um also

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,640
easier uh to scale

00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:00,480
uh in this case because after you build

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:04,000
out the team to cover

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:07,040
um let's say 24 uh by seven

00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,400
while you need more engineers as you get

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,880
more customers

00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,319
uh it's not the same kind of

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,359
proportional way

00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:18,240
as uh uh it's uh happens if

00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,520
you know pure consulting services and it

00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,680
also requires medium

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,640
investment to start you probably cannot

00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,480
really provide a good 24x7 support

00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,480
but you know just being one person

00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,160
working part-time right

00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:34,880
you would uh need a team uh to

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,319
really be able to answer your questions

00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,079
you know of your customers

00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:43,440
24x7 but that is uh typically

00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,040
you know a smaller team compared to what

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:50,000
you would need to really

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:53,359
you know do some massive software build

00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,640
now do licenses do a license

00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,440
that is the next business model which is

00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,160
a

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,640
product based and it generally talks

00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,559
about

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,880
selling commercial licensed version of a

00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,119
product for those who cannot comply with

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,720
terms of open source license

00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,640
right in its pure form dual license

00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,920
doesn't mean that there is a feature

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,760
differentiation

00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,520
right it's it simply says hey you know

00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,480
what the same product

00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,000
same features exactly but only available

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,559
open source and

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,319
not open source for those who cannot

00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:30,240
apply

00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:34,000
with that license like mysql

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,559
uh used to uh used to do it for example

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,119
and that

00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,920
is different through a model which what

00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,000
i'll call

00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,280
uh enhanced commercial version right

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,839
which is the

00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,319
this model often kind of uh became

00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,920
connect

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:49,920
uh evolved to become connected to

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,119
those days where you would have a

00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:56,240
community version and then you also have

00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:59,440
a more advanced uh

00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,960
enterprise version right as it's often

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,640
called and that

00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:07,599
version is available on the commercial

00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,319
or under a commercial license right so

00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,280
you

00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,960
both have a dual license commercial and

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,280
open source but you have

00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,240
also different features which are

00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,920
available

00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:23,359
on the property options right

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,880
so in this case you have enhanced

00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:28,480
commercial version

00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:31,200
you know of a product and so

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,079
uh sold right and that's traditionally

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,800
packaged with

00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,440
uh additional benefits such as you know

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,800
support

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:41,119
sort subscription right uh this

00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,119
uh business model do alliance enhance

00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,480
commercial version they typically get

00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:48,640
uh require even

00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,599
even more investments because as you

00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,720
start

00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:56,079
selling the uh the software there are

00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,960
uh many things in play in terms of

00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,000
people

00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,319
uh start to expect all things

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,640
i mentioned about you know like security

00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:07,280
remediation

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,800
uh right packages and so on and so forth

00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,839
for fright which

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,960
tend to uh require a team

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:16,240
to maintain and that is uh in general

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,079
right you can see here

00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,280
some founders stories which can say hey

00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,280
you know what i just

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,960
you know started selling my commercial

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,040
version of my product right and that's

00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:29,200
how i

00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,640
uh made my money uh right my first money

00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,319
and i think that's

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,319
workable in uh more of a kind of a b2c

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,440
industries when a product is not as

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,200
business critical

00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,599
right for example you have i know let's

00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,800
say some

00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:48,079
open source developer tool right or

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,880
or something else uh often you can do it

00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,319
as a

00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,480
as a single developer uh right so

00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,800
because there is not expectation a

00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,559
business critical 24x7 support

00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,119
in market where i come from when it

00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:04,800
comes to mission critical databases

00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:08,079
if people buy your software

00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,839
they also expect all their you know

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,119
mission critical support which comes

00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:16,079
with that which

00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:20,079
requires uh a lot more investment

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:22,880
the next model for open source is uh

00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,079
sas when you can say hey there is an

00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,480
open source software

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,319
which exists out there and there is a

00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,000
sas version of that software which is

00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:32,880
commercially uh available

00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,520
right uh the great example of that would

00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,839
be

00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,079
for example uh wordpress right where you

00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,240
can

00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:43,040
download install wordpress as completely

00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:46,079
open source or you can also get

00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,960
uh sas deployment from

00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,480
wordpress.com in this case it is

00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,760
typically paired with a free

00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:56,960
model all right where you can uh

00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,160
you know try things out for free right

00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,359
in the cloud and then uh

00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,319
later on you become you know paying

00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,079
customers

00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:11,119
the same applies in the uh

00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:13,359
to the database space right you would uh

00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,880
see the database as a service being a

00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,799
very popular way to

00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,119
deploy database right now right being

00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:20,799
that amazon or others

00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,599
right and also typically would have some

00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:24,640
sort of like a uh you know free tier or

00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,680
free three

00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:30,480
uh free triggers uh

00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,960
free or something to try it out now what

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,160
is also

00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:37,200
interesting in this case is

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:40,720
uh in most cases sas version

00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:43,359
is not 100 open source

00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,000
right even if the end user product

00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,200
features

00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,760
are completely are there there is likely

00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,480
to be

00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,480
like proper interface to do kind of

00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,400
deploy that maybe it's like a

00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,319
property back plane how it's been

00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,880
managed

00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,799
and uh and so on and so forth right and

00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,920
uh that is a

00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:07,280
reality and that i think has been pretty

00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,280
well accepted uh

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,880
you know by the users right because i

00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:14,079
don't think what's uh

00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,760
um uh

00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,760
there have been a lot of services which

00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:21,280
would really open source

00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,520
everything so you can just go ahead and

00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,520
build exact clone of what they are doing

00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,720
and compete with them

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:32,319
right there while they

00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:35,839
care all costs well and uh

00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:38,240
uh also uh the next one is uh

00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,440
advertising support software right where

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,839
our software

00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:45,920
includes and ads directly or

00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:47,920
indirectly right uh maybe there's let's

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,520
say some functionality to

00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:54,240
remove ads if you uh if you

00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,160
you know pay for software something like

00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,720
like that that may be direct ads

00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,520
or may not be like for example if you

00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,720
think about

00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:05,520
the uh mozilla firefox right

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,880
one of a very successful uh open source

00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,160
um

00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,559
uh projects right for uh for years

00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,599
uh it was always getting a lot of

00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,480
revenue from

00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,200
affiliate uh search partners right so

00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,280
when you

00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,200
search in firefox you don't necessarily

00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,480
see a lot of ads from

00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,480
firefox itself but

00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:32,720
the search partners essentially uh well

00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:36,319
they share revenue right through

00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:40,000
uh through firefox and uh as i mentioned

00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:43,440
this is a multiple choice

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,640
choice answer uh another thing

00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:50,319
uh which you want to think about them

00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:54,000
uh a business model is uh

00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:57,119
what is going to be your uh go to market

00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,040
right one is selling to the end user

00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,920
which typically means there is large

00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:04,319
volume of a small medium-sized deals

00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,599
and that often allows to for an

00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,799
expensive and quick

00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:12,000
sales process often uh

00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:15,839
based around their

00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,040
e-commerce right you would hear about

00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:20,960
some companies at least at the very

00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,160
beginning say hey we didn't have anybody

00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,440
in sales at

00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:29,599
all right we'll just

00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:31,520
have an online forum for people to

00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,640
to buy what we have to sell right and

00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,400
that is

00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:38,240
one very good model and it's also good

00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,720
because you don't have to hire

00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,280
enterprise selling folks the sales folks

00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,720
which

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,680
are uh very expensive and i would say

00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,640
for

00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,559
a lot of the open source uh developers

00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,319
themselves while they may be

00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:55,760
good at writing the code and even

00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:59,200
providing the end user support

00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:02,880
probably they would not be very good

00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:05,359
doing enterprise selling dealing with

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,640
all that you know mountains of paperwork

00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:10,240
which required in this case and so on

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,960
and so forth right at least i know for

00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,520
me

00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:16,160
in the early days really dealing with

00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,520
that sales process that was

00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:22,640
uh um uh one of the

00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:26,160
uh things i liked the least

00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,880
uh even though um was like 15 years ago

00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,760
right when i

00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,960
uh did that the enterprise selling

00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,839
process was

00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:37,119
easier than it is now

00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,799
the other thing that you have to think

00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,280
about or it's maybe given in your

00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:42,480
product

00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:46,480
is the ownership of uh governance

00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:49,680
right and you can see what there are uh

00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,079
different different uh things in

00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,760
this case and there are many open source

00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,720
projects and related products

00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,640
in both camps right if you think about

00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,040
the community foundation governed

00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,520
product right linux postgresql

01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,319
kubernetes drupal and so on and so forth

01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,119
right

01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:08,079
uh you would often see multiple

01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,559
companies

01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,559
offering some sort of commercial

01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:15,839
distribution right or otherwise

01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:17,760
offering around the product uh right

01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:20,079
and many companies to participate in

01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,480
development and so on so forth or

01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,640
you can have a governance where single

01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,520
company governance product like mysql

01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,559
mongodb

01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,480
and genex and many others and then other

01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,599
companies may be able to contribute that

01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,000
but that's

01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,920
you know typically the future of of a

01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,920
product is defined by the single

01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:42,960
uh uh by the single

01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,880
uh company and again if you are

01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,160
looking at existing products well you

01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,280
just have to figure out and what

01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,119
companies

01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,720
if you are thinking about what to do

01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:53,760
with your product

01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,680
you uh you have a kind of two choices

01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,720
right is as a company owned

01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,680
open source or you can try to get a

01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:04,160
product

01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:07,280
uh to be included in one of um

01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,640
you know independent let's say

01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,559
foundation

01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:15,280
and then build your product around that

01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,839
right like for example if you think uh

01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,359
about

01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:22,480
uh cassandra right or

01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:25,520
uh hadoop they are

01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:28,000
open uh they're also like community

01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,480
foundation products right even though

01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,559
uh there are companies like cloudera or

01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,359
data stocks which

01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:37,680
really build the business around them

01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,079
and at that time it was i think decision

01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,200
was

01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:44,480
having that as a foundation

01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:46,640
driven makes it better for uh

01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,480
for for distribution right and for

01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,240
growth for which as i mentioned

01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,440
growth and monetization those are kind

01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,799
of two things that you have to always

01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,000
balance

01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:59,680
okay let's move on uh

01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:02,319
to the uh last topic of this discussion

01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,440
unless you folks have some

01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:09,599
questions you know check in

01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:13,039
nothing in q a nobody in

01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:16,640
in charts it seems like it okay

01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:20,640
cool then i'll just continue and uh

01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:23,760
um you know ask if you have

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:26,319
so let's talk about licenses for

01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,880
open source and maybe not quite open

01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:31,839
source

01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:34,880
software the first i'll have to give you

01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:38,000
a warning what i am not a lawyer

01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,319
right this is uh my understanding

01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,200
you know do i think that's as a legal

01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:44,160
advice and

01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,200
obviously uh most likely i will have

01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,839
something

01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,000
wrong right and butcher some terms or

01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:54,480
something like that so if there are some

01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,760
uh lawyers on this call please

01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,119
forgive me for that if you look at the

01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,359
open source

01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,119
as i mentioned briefly there is you can

01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,079
think about kind of two types of open

01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,079
source right

01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,920
there is an open source and substance

01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:11,680
and there is using open source for

01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:14,160
uh for marketing right and then

01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:17,839
build the models which are really

01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,839
focused at

01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,920
you know selling commercial open source

01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,119
software around that

01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,839
if you look at the truly open source uh

01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:30,799
it's um is not like a registered

01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:34,000
trademark

01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:36,960
as some other terms we're dealing

01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,119
every day basically so there is not just

01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,240
one

01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:44,480
definition uh if you think about

01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,760
free and open source software i think

01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,520
those are three uh

01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,079
most important sources right there is a

01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,119
osi open source initiative there is a

01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,400
gno

01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:55,280
which defines uh free software and there

01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,160
is also

01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,280
debian the used term of debian 3 in open

01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,599
source software

01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,559
right but generally if your software is

01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,640
compliant

01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,400
with with those right you would consider

01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:11,119
that open source

01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:14,400
open source initiative right they are

01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,559
uh kind of uh can uh uh have a

01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,520
eco giant adjustment right wherever

01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,559
given license

01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,640
is uh open source uh or not

01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,799
but that has a value of i would say like

01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,799
a community pressure

01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,839
most and foremost right it's not like

01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:30,880
you can

01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:32,880
you know get sued right if you say oh

01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,119
uh my software is open source but it's

01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:38,400
not licensed on osi approved

01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:41,680
uh license like i

01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,720
when it comes to the uh open source and

01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,480
free software

01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,400
and sorry i will use the terms

01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,960
interchargeably in this case right even

01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,920
if

01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,440
you know people who are really from one

01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,160
or other camps may really want to

01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,880
highlight the difference in the emphasis

01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,000
i like free software uh definition

01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,599
because it's so

01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,920
dumb simple it really uh talks about the

01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,520
uh software freedom and those kind of

01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:09,039
four

01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:12,960
are essentially uh

01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:16,079
essential freedoms right which

01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,839
uh which it provides

01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,160
so when i speak about the open source

01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:21,760
business i think uh i mentioned this

01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,240
with the monetizing

01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,359
truly opens your software and is hard

01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:29,039
right and even if it's

01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:31,359
not there uh

01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,480
you know just open source right if you

01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:35,760
have some

01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:38,720
additional uh software traditionally

01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,079
you will have only single digit of

01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,000
percent of your users

01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,359
actually being monetized actually paying

01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,240
for software

01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:48,480
while other is just using that i think

01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,960
with cloud that is a

01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,599
kind of going to change and more users

01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,440
are going to

01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,200
pay for using for running open source

01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,400
software in the plow in the cloud

01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,799
wherever is

01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,680
to the open source software copyright

01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:02,000
holder

01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,720
right or somebody else that's another

01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,839
store

01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,200
right like as i mentioned amazon they

01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:10,079
are making

01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,039
more money on mysql on the cloud than

01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,160
oracle right

01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:16,160
i don't know uh details but i would be

01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,480
surprised if that's less than the order

01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:22,640
of magnitude

01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:26,799
difference so you often

01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:30,839
are faced if it's a choice or on the

01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:34,160
license choices right

01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:37,280
between their ease of uh

01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,760
distribution right and growth right

01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,680
that's

01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,200
often comes with a permissive open

01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,240
source license

01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:46,559
to maximizing monetization right which

01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,680
gets harder

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:50,400
easier as you go from permissive license

01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,799
to

01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,680
you know property software there

01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:57,280
obviously you have

01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:58,000
opportunity to monetize every single

01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,799
user

01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,119
of your software by charging them but

01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:06,720
that often does not

01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:11,039
uh create as much distribution

01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:13,599
if you look at the two big licenses

01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,559
in their open source license classes

01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,760
that would be

01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:20,880
permissive and copy left right

01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:24,640
what is the key difference the

01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:27,680
permissive licenses that means what

01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,680
somebody can modify the software

01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,520
create derived work and do whatever we

01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,480
want with the results including license

01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:35,760
is commercially

01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:38,000
like postgresql is exact is very

01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,599
good example here again in the uh open

01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,400
source database space from which i come

01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,760
from

01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:48,480
right there uh there are a lot

01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:51,520
a lot of commercial postgresql derived

01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,799
uh distributions right because

01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:57,680
uh uh they come copyleft

01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:59,359
that means means you can modify software

01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,920
but you need to distribute all the

01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,400
changes

01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,680
under the save license right so for

01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,440
example with

01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:10,799
mysql there are not

01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:13,280
not many uh commercial

01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:14,960
uh derived products right some people

01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,640
can play a little bit kind of games with

01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,480
gpl saying oh you know what

01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,120
uh uh we are uh shipping you kind of

01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,040
some

01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,120
other companies which commercial right

01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,560
and

01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:28,640
right packaging that to give us

01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,120
commercial only option but it's not the

01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,279
same

01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:35,839
as with postgres and but as i mentioned

01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,679
uh in the modern world where often we do

01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,799
not ship software just run it in the

01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,839
cloud

01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:44,960
this kind of breaks because

01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:47,199
uh the copy left software

01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,000
license what mysql use did not prevent

01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:51,359
from

01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,880
amazon hijacking that and another thing

01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:56,080
you need to consider

01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:58,799
uh with a license is

01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,600
uh if you when you're building a product

01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,799
it may be

01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,799
belong to one of a sort of a ecosystem

01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,239
rather than creating your own and all

01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,839
those different tech systems have

01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:11,359
preference for their licenses

01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:15,359
right so for example stuff around linux

01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:18,880
is based about around gpl

01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:21,120
so in that community right building

01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,520
extensions or whatever

01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:26,000
gpl is very acceptable license

01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,920
kubernetes runs on apache to the whole

01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,319
license postgresql

01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,040
is postgresql license right and at least

01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:33,359
for the

01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,799
open source parts of your product

01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,520
project and again

01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:39,359
in many cases you would for your

01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,400
business model choose to have

01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:45,920
the open source and the property reports

01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,920
it's often good idea to

01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,040
use the license which is adopted by the

01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,319
community

01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:55,920
right if it fits for you or to avoid

01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:58,320
extra uh friction

01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,520
when you think about the business model

01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,600
and the license

01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,120
you have to figure out what i will call

01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,360
that a license

01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:07,040
model fit right so you really need to

01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:09,520
make sure

01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:12,320
what the license or licenses you choose

01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:15,520
really choose

01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:18,159
fit your model and again

01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:21,280
let's go through where uh license models

01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:24,000
we spoke about and see

01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,560
how they fit to the different models if

01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,199
you look

01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,679
at a consultant in customer engineering

01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:32,000
permissive license

01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,360
were great because a lot of people use

01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,760
your software

01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,960
all right and you get a lot of adoption

01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,080
and that gets more

01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,520
uh business right and also if you are

01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,080
in the consulting and customer

01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,840
engineering space your public cloud sas

01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:49,280
is not a major competition

01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:51,679
right frankly if you are uh in the

01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,840
business of doing consulting and amazon

01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:56,000
decided to package your product and run

01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,120
in the cloud oh that is fantastic that

01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,560
means there will be

01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:03,040
a lot of business for you now

01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,640
on amazon and they will be very happy to

01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,199
work as a partner if you and send you

01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,320
some

01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:10,239
consulting business most likely if you

01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:12,800
are thinking about

01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:14,560
supporting managed services that can

01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,360
work with variety of licenses but in

01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:20,000
this case you're starting to

01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,199
uh think about the competition from a

01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,840
hyperscale

01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:27,520
cloud providers right because uh if

01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:31,280
amazon runs

01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,320
let's say postgres or radius or whatever

01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,320
we say hey

01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,800
we got you covered you don't kind of

01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,040
need support and we are providing you

01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,480
finally managed services right

01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:44,320
so uh in this case you or while it can

01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:47,840
work with

01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:50,960
any license often figuring out how to

01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,600
uh protect it uh starts to be uh making

01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,880
sense

01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:57,679
the problem is what uh conventional

01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:00,960
copyleft licenses they haven't been very

01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:04,800
sexy very good and kind of deterring

01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:07,280
amazon from uh doing what they are doing

01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,040
uh and that's uh forced a lot of product

01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:12,320
for the project suppose it's

01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:15,440
this is important to even use uh

01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,760
uh source available licenses right or

01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,480
ship

01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,920
some components at least as a commercial

01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,600
altogether

01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:25,600
right if you are uh employing we do a

01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:28,960
licensed business model

01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,640
then this license really relies on open

01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,960
source license limitations

01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,080
right it's you wouldn't get a lot of the

01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,719
license if you

01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,239
license everything under like bc license

01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,480
right for example because somebody can

01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:43,679
already take it

01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:45,360
and run it for free uh and you know do

01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:48,719
the right work for free right

01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:51,920
so in this case uh you are

01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:53,040
looking at copyleft and source available

01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,159
licenses

01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:59,120
especially uh if you uh

01:12:56,159 --> 01:13:00,320
if your product is of a nature what the

01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:05,040
competition with cloud

01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:07,199
vendors may exist

01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,040
now for enhanced commercial commercial

01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:12,960
version uh that is where

01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,960
you often have a different um uh

01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,840
uh many different choices right and that

01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:20,880
an enhanced commercial version

01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:24,159
also may mean different things you know

01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,760
in uh some cases you would have your

01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:27,520
open source version which is kind of

01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,440
very

01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,040
full featured right and in this case you

01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,520
may want to have more protection from

01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,280
that

01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:37,440
from that right so uh let's say you know

01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,719
people cannot just take too much of that

01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,760
stuff from you

01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:45,280
if your uh version

01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,640
uh open source version is uh much more

01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,840
crippled

01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,400
then in this case well you may not need

01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,360
that

01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,400
in some case i i've seen people would

01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,880
have a

01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,880
relatively limited open source version

01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,280
like for example if no hive ability

01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,280
or you know like a reduced scaling on

01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,840
and so on so forth available

01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:08,000
under completely you know permissive

01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,960
license but there is

01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,719
a lot of a very important stuff in a

01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,640
enhanced commercial version

01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,640
right which it creates enough of

01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:25,719
a differentiation when it comes to sas

01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:27,120
in practice to prevent competition from

01:14:25,719 --> 01:14:30,000
hyperscalers

01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:32,080
source available license are often used

01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,040
but that also i think applies to the

01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,159
products

01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:39,440
which got a lot of traction

01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:42,400
and which are really this you know vc

01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,520
uh funded uh product right which are

01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:47,199
looking for

01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:49,679
many billion dollars of valuation

01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:51,280
right and um for me that was kind of

01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:54,320
very interesting to see

01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:57,360
is how uh for example amazon rds was

01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:59,600
received by uh

01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,280
something like a mongodb and postgresql

01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,880
communities right where

01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,679
mongodb is like oh my gosh we really

01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:09,360
need to prevent the competition so we

01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,600
have it on you know we get

01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,960
all the revenue capture where from

01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,360
postgresql

01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,480
community we can say oh great now so

01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:19,600
many people can

01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,159
will be exposed to a postgresql and run

01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,080
it

01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:25,679
great job amazon will love what you are

01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:28,159
doing that you know i do support

01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,800
in generally can work with uh with any

01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:31,920
license

01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:34,239
i think what you just need to be

01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,080
uh mindful in this case right because if

01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:38,960
you become too mean then people

01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,520
can exercise very kind of right to fork

01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,520
and

01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:47,199
ship your packages with your uh odds uh

01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,199
removed right

01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:54,000
so i would say be careful with that

01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,360
uh one interesting trend that i would

01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,840
want to know just is

01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,600
if you see for open source software and

01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:03,199
again this doesn't talks about the

01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,800
proprietary um like enhanced versions

01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:07,520
right and so on and so forth

01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,199
we can see what the permissive license

01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,719
is very gaining momentum

01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:16,719
like every year since 2012

01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:20,159
and actually here uh before that

01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:21,040
right so uh well uh because i think

01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:24,800
that's

01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:27,199
uh really helps uh uh helps adoption

01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,040
and when people ask me about mysql and

01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:31,120
postgres they'll say hey that is one of

01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,600
the reasons what postgresql

01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,120
is choose in many embedded environments

01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,760
right for example if you think about

01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,239
like a

01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,880
you know gitlabs or atlas sense of this

01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:41,040
world

01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,440
it might makes much more sense for them

01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:46,480
to uh

01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:48,080
include postgres because they can have

01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:51,360
it very easily

01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:53,199
a real license in the whole package

01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,880
under property license and they need

01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:57,600
which you just wouldn't be able to do

01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,600
with mysql

01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:02,320
another interesting trend is obviously

01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:05,600
rise of source available license

01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:08,480
right at least in uh in database

01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,760
space you can see uh because of that

01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,800
fear of the cloud

01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:15,520
a lot of companies are moving at least

01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,000
some of us software under source

01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:20,719
available

01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:24,960
license to prevent that kind of

01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:27,920
uh uh competition

01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,800
now a few more things i think you need

01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,080
to think about

01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:34,800
when you are thinking about the

01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,920
license to choose your product one is

01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,760
combination

01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,600
how do you expect your software to be

01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:42,719
combined with open source

01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:46,320
software right and property software by

01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:50,480
uh by users right which can drive

01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:52,640
your uh your license choices right

01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,679
uh and often it can be different parts

01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,120
for example

01:17:53,679 --> 01:18:00,239
while i mentioned mongodb even went

01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,040
away from uh software open source

01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:03,280
license to

01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,159
source available license for the server

01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:07,040
side

01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:09,360
for connectors they went with a very uh

01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,320
liberal permissive license because they

01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,320
want

01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,840
uh everybody being able to include

01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:17,600
connectors to

01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:20,960
any software with uh no questions

01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:25,280
um asked right to reduce that uh

01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:27,120
friction marketplaces that is another

01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,560
uh interesting thing which you have to

01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,560
be aware

01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,400
in many cases especially certain kinds

01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,320
of open source software people start to

01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:37,920
consume that from various

01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:40,239
marketplaces right be in that

01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,320
apple app store google play the amazon

01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:45,840
marketplace and so on and so forth

01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:48,320
many of those marketplaces do not allow

01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,760
all licenses for example you will see

01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:54,320
what the agpl

01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:57,920
is not allowed by many licensed manufam

01:18:54,320 --> 01:19:01,920
and um uh apple apps office

01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:04,960
store doesn't even allow a gpl

01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:08,480
as far as i uh

01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:11,040
as i uh understand oh actually gpl

01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:14,719
conflicts of the terms right what uh

01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:16,400
are placed by the uh app store right

01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,840
sorry for interrupting we only have five

01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,239
minutes left

01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,960
okay yes we have another five slides

01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:26,960
left too

01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:29,520
okay so the next thing to consider

01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,560
is uh the license and the copyright and

01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,760
i have seen

01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:35,520
many developers right especially with no

01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,360
illegal background not understanding

01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,560
that until it's kind of too

01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:43,120
too late right so if you

01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,320
have a copyright for all the code in

01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,679
your project

01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:49,679
then you can change the license uh

01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:50,880
at any time for new version of software

01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,480
right you don't uh

01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,560
your license is not working out for you

01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:58,400
you can change it right

01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,920
uh and other people who just have a

01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:02,239
license to your product but they don't

01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,560
have a full copyright on it

01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:06,080
they uh they cannot do that like for

01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,719
example at your corner

01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,560
we ship enhanced version of mysql called

01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:13,199
percona server for mysql

01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,000
right but because we inherit a lot of

01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:17,440
code and the

01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,120
gpl license from mysql or like oracle

01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:21,120
and we don't have a copyright for that

01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:25,120
we have no choice but only to

01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:28,400
ship that under postgresql of

01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:31,280
gpl gpu compatible license

01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,239
what that means is if you are developer

01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,480
having your product

01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:36,480
make sure for accepting the

01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:39,520
contributions to your product

01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,440
uh get the uh

01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:43,199
the license grant to you for some

01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:45,440
contributors agreement to accept them

01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:48,800
under some very permissive license

01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:50,800
so you can change your license later on

01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:54,159
if you if that's what is important to

01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:56,880
you because otherwise you may need to

01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:58,560
chase you know 100 contributors you go

01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,320
to the last two years

01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,840
and ask him to change the license which

01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:04,960
is tough

01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:08,719
another thing to consider is open source

01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:10,560
and trademark these are

01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:11,920
different right many open source

01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,800
software does not

01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,239
really give people permission to use the

01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,800
trademark right

01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:19,600
and that is something what you need to

01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,840
think through

01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:24,239
many open source companies would publish

01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,800
their trademark policies

01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:28,480
separately from the license and that may

01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:32,080
be more

01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:37,199
or less uh clear some of them

01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:37,199
newer open source license they also talk

01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:44,000
about this open source and patents right

01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:46,639
that is another thing you would need to

01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,199
uh consider right for you know software

01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,679
patterns

01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:50,320
is uh a big deal somebody can get into

01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:53,760
trouble

01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:56,480
uh for right so uh

01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,840
the the open source license may or may

01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:02,400
not

01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:05,600
include a patent uh grant in them so

01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:08,960
check that typically the users

01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,719
especially enterprise ones they do care

01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,400
about patents they want to make sure

01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:16,080
they're not going to get into you know

01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:19,280
patent violation by using your software

01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:22,560
well and uh uh

01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:25,360
another thing i wanted to highlight

01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,880
is if you look at the license and say

01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,440
well you know what

01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,560
open source license i understand all of

01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,960
that but really

01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,760
we need more protection from those you

01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,880
know pesky

01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,560
cloud vendors or somebody else

01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:41,280
i would recommend to check out this

01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,639
polyform project which is

01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,480
the new development which is a

01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:47,920
collection of

01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:50,400
not open source licenses but relatively

01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,880
simple licenses for different use cases

01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,600
right and i wish more of a product would

01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,239
use

01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,639
those licenses right because it would be

01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,679
uh

01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:03,120
easier for users to understand the uh

01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:06,400
restrictions right compared to

01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:08,159
having those you know the huge

01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,679
number of a different shared service

01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:12,960
license which have been

01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:14,480
created over the last few years so with

01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,560
that

01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:18,480
uh here is a summary what we we spoke

01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,920
about today right in terms of your

01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,520
building the business around the open

01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,320
source choosing license and business

01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:23,920
model

01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:26,080
i would encourage you to decide on your

01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:29,360
goals versus the open source

01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:32,400
project you have you know pick your

01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:35,679
business goals to reach those goals

01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:36,080
and then pick open source licenses right

01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,080
or

01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,920
not only open source slides to support

01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,000
that and as you do that

01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,040
i would encourage you to continue to

01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,719
contribute into

01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:51,520
open source as much as you can

01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:51,520
and if that that's all i have

01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:56,880
thank you we just had one comment uh

01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:58,719
perhaps important to remember many open

01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,280
source contributors i know will refuse

01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:03,120
to contribute to any project with acla

01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:05,360
as they prefer to keep copyright over

01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:08,159
their own contributions

01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:10,639
well uh yes that is a that is a good

01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:13,040
point right and that is a balance uh

01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:15,280
uh balance to hit right i would say

01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:18,400
there are uh

01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:21,920
if uh with uh if you see

01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:24,000
uh with a cla right um

01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,520
uh i have seen both those things uh

01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,440
creating a lot of friction

01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:33,440
and also you know working quite well

01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:35,679
in uh in other cases and also cla

01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,880
is uh can be different right in some

01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,040
cases cla just

01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,159
uh means you're sort of like selling

01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,120
your own uh

01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:43,600
unborn children in other cases cla can

01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,400
actually

01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,920
mean uh things as a shared copyright

01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,360
saying hey you know what i as a

01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,199
developer yeah i give you

01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,639
give it to open source project copyright

01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:52,960
so you can do whatever you want of it

01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:56,000
but

01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:58,880
also for for my code

01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,159
right i can do whatever that with that

01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:03,040
as well

01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:04,239
