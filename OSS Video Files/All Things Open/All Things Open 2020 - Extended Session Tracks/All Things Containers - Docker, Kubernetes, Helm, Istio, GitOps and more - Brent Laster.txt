Abstract: In this workshop, students will get a quick overview of what containers are and why they form the basis for many of the key technologies that we use today in cloud environments.

We’ll explore what makes up a container and how they are managed and leveraged in key industry tooling including Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and Istio. You’ll also learn the basics of these technologies, what they are used for, and see some simple examples of how to use them.

This workshop will include hands-on labs where you will get experience:

- Building container images, running them as containers, and tagging and pushing them into a Docker repository.
- Creating deployments, services, and pods for containers and instantiating and running those in Kubernetes.
- Working with Helm to leverage templates for Kubernetes objects and managing releases in Kubernetes.
- Working with Istio to do traffic shaping between multiple versions of your app, fault and delay injection for testing and validation in Kubernetes.
- We’ll also briefly cover GitOps – the recommended Git-based way to manage infrastructure like your Kubernetes cluster.

Prerequisites (Please have this ready before the talk)

- The virtual machine image (ova file – around 5 gigs) is at https://www.dropbox.com/s/bwk4v05il0j4uq5/ato-ws2.ova?dl=0 (Secondary image if first link is not working: https://bclconf.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ato-ws2.ova)
- To run this, you will need the Virtual Box application installed on their machine. It is available from virtualbox.org.
- To help in getting the image into Virtual Box and running it there, there is a setup doc at https://github.com/brentlaster/conf/blob/master/ato2020/cws-setup.pdf
- If you run into problems with running Virtual Box or the image, there is a troubleshooting doc that may help you out with the most common problems at https://github.com/brentlaster/conf/blob/master/vbtroubleshoot.pdf.
