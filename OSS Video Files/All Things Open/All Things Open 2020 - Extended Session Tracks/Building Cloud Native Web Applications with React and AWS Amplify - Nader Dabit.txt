Abstract: In this workshop we'll learn how to build cloud-enabled web applications with GraphQL, React, & AWS Amplify. AWS Amplify is an open source framework that provides an opinionated set of libraries, UI components, and a command line interface to build an app backend and integrate it with your iOS, Android, Web, and React Native apps. The Amplify Framework leverages a core set of AWS Cloud Services to offer capabilities including offline data, authentication, analytics, push notifications, and bots at high scale.

After attending this workshop you will have a good understanding of how to use AWS Amplify to build cloud native web applications and the architectural components. You will be able to use these as the basis for your own projects.

Attendees will need to have an AWS account to take part in this workshop, need a laptop/desktop with a modern web browser and connectivity to the internet.
