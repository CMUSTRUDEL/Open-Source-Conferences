Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Extended Sessions Tracks

Abstract: Open Source powers the world, but you need to do more than use it. 

In this talk we will provide background on the most common types of open source licenses, business models, security issues and the processes required to help you remain secure and in compliance. We will discuss best practices, scanning tools, remediation, customer and partner expectations around OSS compliance and how to manage OSS during events such as a product release or M&A.

chat window as it comes up

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,320
and let's get going

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,920
so a little bit about myself my as i

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,680
said too many times my name is jeff lush

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,000
i founded a pal a company called

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,600
palamida back in 2004

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
which was one of the first scanning

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,920
tools to manage open source

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,360
i've designed a compliance audit program

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,119
and built out a professional services

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,520
team to implement that program

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,720
and that team has helped everyone handle

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,799
basic compliance

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,960
m a due diligence open source project

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,159
hygiene and other things involving open

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,799
source licensing

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,680
and security and i've worked with sole

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,759
proprietors

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
in open source projects all the way up

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,600
to the largest companies in the world

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,159
and i've seen the industry move

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,720
back in the early 2000s from using maybe

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,079
a couple

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,759
dozen open source projects to now using

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,079
thousands and thousands of thousands of

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,920
packages in a typical application

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,840
so today in the two sessions we're going

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,079
to go over a couple things related

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,280
to open source licensing security and

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,200
compliance

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
in the first block we're going to go

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,280
over open source licenses

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,959
why do we have them a little bit about

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
the history of them

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,200
what types of licenses exist as well as

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,520
the obligations that you might see

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,040
we'll then move into compliance and talk

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,120
about notices

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,120
what others are doing how business

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,080
models affect licensing

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,120
how m a and open source releases may

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,360
affect licensing

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,599
and some hot topics that are coming up

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,120
in the licensing world

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,680
in our second half we'll move to

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,959
security talk about vulnerabilities and

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,920
how to fix them

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,640
what customers expect and some tools and

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,360
scanners

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,040
that can help manage and then lastly

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,200
we'll go more into best practices

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,640
so working with suppliers how do you

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,360
become compliant

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,200
how do you manage education remediation

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
a little more on scanning tools and the

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,560
pluses and minuses there

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,560
and some thoughts about the future

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,959
so the big question today why do we need

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,360
open source licenses

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,720
well the main reason is because we live

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,000
in a society where

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,040
copyright law exists so copyright

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,159
is how authors how people who create

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,120
content whether it's movies music or

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,760
software control their work we have

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,840
given

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,959
the people who create things who create

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
content

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,480
the the basically a legal framework to

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
decide

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,239
who gets to use their work and you need

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,640
explicit permission

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
in order to use someone else's work and

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,599
the way that we have decided to give

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,879
other people's permission

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,040
is through a license or a contract and

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,159
all of us have probably managed

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,840
commercial licenses

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,480
if you've gone out and purchased an app

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,560
on your phone if you have purchased an

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
office product if you've purchased a

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
game for

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,000
your video game system you have

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,840
purchased a commercial license to a

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,400
piece of software

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,959
open source licenses are the same thing

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,439
it's the

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,480
way we give permission no money is

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,319
exchanged

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,720
open source by its very definition is

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,760
free but there's been a trade of

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,280
obligations

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,519
so the open source author doesn't have

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,360
to hang out on the telephone and answer

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,080
every question about can i use it can i

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,880
use it can i use

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,199
it they basically have said if you

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,799
follow this list of obligations

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,040
you get to use my software you get to

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,720
use my library if you don't

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,880
if you don't follow my obligations you

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,080
don't get to use this piece of software

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,080
this library so uh

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,759
a license is a legal agreement and it

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,080
may be difficult to understand

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
there are millions and millions of

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,080
lawyers in the world

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,759
who every day look at contracts and look

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,720
at agreements and try to figure out what

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,280
they mean

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,960
and typically we want to spend more time

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
writing software in building software

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,240
than reading

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,560
legal agreements and so what we've kind

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,360
of decided on as an industry is that

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,040
we have a few common legal agreements we

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,240
call those open source licenses

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,120
or other licenses that make reuse easier

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,880
we don't want to have to negotiate or

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,199
understand a new license each and every

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,199
time we download a software library

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,960
so we've picked a few the community has

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,120
kind of picked a few licenses

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,560
that are the common open source licenses

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,240
to make reuse easier

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,720
and we'll talk about what those look

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,720
like today

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,199
so i talked about how there are

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,199
obligations so different licenses

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,880
have different types of obligations you

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,840
can imagine that you could have a

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
contract

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
that is four lines long you might have a

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,840
license that is four lines long

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,919
or you might have a contract that is

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,440
dozens of pages or hundreds or pages or

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,639
thousands of pages long

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,960
you can imagine if you're buying a

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,800
company you might sign a contract that's

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,479
a couple hundred pages long

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,720
if you're using a small piece of

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,039
javascript you don't wanna license that

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,400
that is that long so you might wanna

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,080
pick something that's a little shorter a

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
little easier to understand and maybe

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,319
doesn't have as many obligations

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
so there is a spectrum there's an

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,639
ecosystem of licenses out there

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,840
some of them have almost no obligations

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,840
whatsoever

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,000
they're just a legal framework to say i

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,039
wrote this you can use it

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,120
um you don't have to do anything

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,319
there may be just a disclaimer hey i

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,960
wrote this

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,319
i don't want to get sued i put this out

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,680
there into the open source world but i

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,680
really don't want to lose my house

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,280
because you used my software and decided

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,880
that you should sue me

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,400
so on the lower end of the spectrum

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,560
there's there's some disclaimers

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,560
and warranties there may just be notices

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,319
what that means is please keep my

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
copyright statement in the code that i

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,360
wrote

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,120
don't don't strip my my copyright or my

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,080
other notices or my licenses

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,919
please give credit where credit is due

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,039
and then we move into some of the

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,440
what might consider stronger obligations

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,800
or or some people say this gives you

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,240
more freedom some people say this gives

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,440
you less freedom but the idea of

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,080
copyleft

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,960
which means if you use this software

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,080
that i give you

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,720
the software library i expect you to

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,000
give

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
some or all of your source code away if

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,639
you

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,319
give people this product or if you in

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,880
some cases give access to it over the

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,639
internet

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,000
that's what we call copyleft and we'll

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,199
talk a little bit more about that in

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,880
later slides

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
and there also may be some restrictions

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,800
around business models

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,080
not all of these are open source

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,759
obligations some of these are just

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,120
obligations and restrictions that we see

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,479
in the licensing world

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,880
but there may be a business model

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,560
restriction maybe you're very concerned

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,759
about nuclear power plants and the

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
danger of

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,440
what might happen if your software fails

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,360
we'll see in some cases some

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,080
restrictions on

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,880
airplane software nuclear power plant

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,960
software

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,479
or in some cases some business models

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
maybe people don't want you to compete

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,720
with them

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,400
and they've put some restrictions in

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,879
their licensing we'll talk about a

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,759
little bit

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,840
about that later on today so a license

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,360
may have one or more obligations

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,160
typically typically is going to have at

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,919
least a disclaimer and a notices

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,680
obligation but there may be more and

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,800
some are obviously easier to comply with

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,520
than others

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,879
if it's just a disclaimer you say i'm

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,240
not going to sue this person if it's a

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,599
notice obligation

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,360
you're going to provide those notices

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,479
when you provide your software other

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,479
things are a little more difficult

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,560
so there's a large series of obligations

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,199
that are out there

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,240
many of them may require some legal

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,160
analysis

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,080
especially if you are running a business

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,520
or if you want to

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,360
do some things that may be a little

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,080
strange or different than what the open

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,160
source world typically does

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,840
it is very important for you to go and

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,560
get good legal advice none of what i

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,279
give you today

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,120
is legal advice i'm not a lawyer i don't

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,800
play one on tv or anything like that

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,240
but i've worked a lot with engineering

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,599
teams and legal teams and i've seen the

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,240
things that have caused some

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,360
concern between between both of them and

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,519
also the places that have

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,519
been very difficult for each other to

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,760
understand

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,519
one of the big obligations that we see

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,440
in the commercial world is paying money

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,680
a commercial obligation that's not an

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,519
open source obligation by any means

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,920
but probably 10 percent of the software

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,440
that you use has some sort of commercial

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,760
agreement around it

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
may require money may just be a click

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,320
through eula

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,279
but it is commercial it's not open

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,680
source there may be some other licenses

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,560
that

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,000
say share your source code as we talked

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,080
about that's copy left

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
you may need to bundle some source code

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,519
when you make a distribution

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
you deliver your product to people

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,080
you're going to need to share

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
credit which means either give

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,120
attribution or notices

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,360
i'll talk a little bit more about that

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,920
in a little bit but you may see that in

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,080
in

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,600
about boxes or documentations or on your

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,720
web pages

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,120
we'll talk a little bit more about

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,399
patents and restrictions around the use

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
of patents

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,399
we talked a little bit about the

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,200
restrictions on use if you are in

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,200
government military or certain types of

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,920
industries like nuclear power

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,000
aviation automotive you may want to look

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,839
very closely at the licenses both

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
commercial and open source

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,640
and in between that you're signing up

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,200
for those are industries that typically

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,320
have restriction notices around field of

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,399
use

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,560
if you are a application service

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,240
provider and you want to

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,600
sell access to say certain types of

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,360
databases you may find restrictions on

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,040
your ability to do that some of the new

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,320
open source or quasi open source

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,760
licenses that are out there

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,480
talk again more about that later on in

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,519
the day you'll hear the term sometimes

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
vanity license this these are one-off

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,000
licenses

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,920
very very typically written by the

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,640
developer themselves

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,800
we saw this more in the early 90s and

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,120
2000s as when there was an explosion of

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,120
open source licensing

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,560
well you still see them from day to day

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,279
as people decide to

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,839
make interesting and funny licenses they

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,480
typically

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,680
typically require some sort of

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,920
non-traditional action

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,839
so one that we see from time to time is

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,040
the free beer license that says you know

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,360
buy me a beer if this helps me helps you

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,440
don't do any evil we see that in one of

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,120
the famous json libraries that are out

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,120
there

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,640
one of the early vanity licenses was a

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,600
get vaccinated

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,560
uh license and again these these are

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,240
typically

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,399
one-offs you're not going to see very

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,040
many of them but they they surprisingly

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,680
will take

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,880
a lot of legal time to just to decide

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,360
whether they're good or bad

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,519
in your in your application so when you

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,680
are picking open source libraries

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,399
try to stay away from vanity licenses or

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,760
one-off licenses if you really can't

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,000
and then lastly you'll see that the

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,600
don't sue me disclaimer or

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,079
as-is lack of warranty uh

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,440
notice obligations basically it says the

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,240
user can't sue

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,320
the open source author so these are the

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,120
main obligations that we're going to see

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,160
there's many many others some of the the

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,800
new licenses

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,480
range from a couple paragraphs to a few

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,240
pages

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,600
that text is there for a reason those

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,279
are obligations those are

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,720
requirements for you for you to

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,639
understand before you use those

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,680
libraries before you use that software

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,880
so do look at each line in a license

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
and make sure you understand it

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,000
so let's talk a little bit about the

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,480
history of open source licenses

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,120
open source really started in the mid

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
80s

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,200
to early 90s there's always been sharing

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,240
a software

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,399
there's always been mag

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,000
tape being sent through the mail being

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,519
driven to people

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,240
discs being sent through the mail et

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,519
cetera but it really was in the mid-80s

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,639
to early 90s

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:34,240
where the computer industry decided

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:37,360
that we need to we need to

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,720
share source code with some sort of

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,160
agreement

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,079
there was this was in the beginning of

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,639
what we called the unix wars there was a

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,279
lot of

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,560
desktop workstations running unix

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,519
companies fighting

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,959
companies building new applications

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,680
building new devices

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,880
and not really sharing the code and the

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,200
hobbyist community

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,160
the academic community the people who

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,480
are really interested

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,079
in building new software products and

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,680
and sharing

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,160
got together and said let's let's make

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,000
licenses let's make agreements that

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,240
make it very clear what the obligations

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
and expectations around sharing are

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,839
i'll talk a little bit about the

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,519
philosophies there but we really got our

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,399
start in open source in the mid

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,360
mid 80s to early 90s the licenses that

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,120
appeared there

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,920
the x11 mit the bsd license

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,279
the general public license family they

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,360
are still with us

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,200
they got it right back in the early

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,399
early 80s and 90s

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,320
for for software that is distributed

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,399
for software that goes on a device or

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,519
runs a program

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,000
then in the 2000s we we saw there was a

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,199
change

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,600
we moved from desktop workstations to

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,040
more of the internet world there was the

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,920
dot-com boom

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,160
there was more sharing on the internet

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,839
there were more websites being created

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,920
there was more software available to be

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,320
downloaded there were sharing sites

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,600
explicitly for open source

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,680
and also there was more commercial

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,680
interests so we moved from

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,959
licenses really coming from the kind of

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,279
the community

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,480
to licenses really being affected by

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,560
commercial interests

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,160
and companies and you'll see that the

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
licenses got longer

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,760
they had more legal tax they had more

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,680
legal folks involved

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,360
and they were really around addressing

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,600
kind of the corporate interests

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,839
of the internet age and we'll talk a

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,120
little bit now about 2020 toward the end

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,959
of the slide deck

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,959
about what's changing what's changed

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,959
since kind of the initial.com world

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
so let's talk about notices these are

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,440
one of the

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,880
easier things to comply with though

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,800
ironically enough

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,360
most companies and most organizations

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,480
are doing a really horrible job

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,079
of complying with the most basic open

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,199
source obligation which is

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,880
providing notices so if you go read

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,720
an open source license and again we'll

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,199
do that in a little bit

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,959
many of them if not all of them require

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,560
some sort of copyright copyright

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,959
statements to be preserved

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,680
or the license text to be preserved and

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,839
passed along to the end user

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,000
this is sometimes called attribution

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,519
notices

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,760
sometimes people call these permissive

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,560
licenses there's a lot of

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,600
terminology around that what do we want

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,000
to call these things but

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,160
at the heart of it they are giving

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,600
credit where credit is due

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,000
if somebody is complying with these

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,880
licenses you may find them in your about

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,759
box

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,360
or a legal info menu or perhaps in the

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,720
back of your documentation or the front

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,079
of your documentation

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,839
and you hopefully will find them

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,880
preserved in any source code

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,600
that is in your repository whether it's

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,000
for your

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,440
developer's use or provided to your to

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,440
your customers or your users

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,279
the other side of the world is the

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,880
copyleft or viral licenses

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,040
there are there is what we call the

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,639
strong copyleft or the weak

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,040
copyleft licenses so the a pharaoh

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,480
general public license the regular

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,720
general public license

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,560
the sleepy cat license or the creative

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,800
commons share a like license

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,000
or often used with stack overflow code

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
samples

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,320
these are licenses that require sharing

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,160
so if you are using

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,040
uh and distributing a product that is uh

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,560
has software under these licenses the

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,480
expectation is that you're going to be

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,880
providing

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,680
pretty much all of the source code for

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,839
that product

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,000
to your users or to your customers and

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,560
there are there are

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,680
kind of refinements of why and where

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,480
that open source

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,480
uh sharing will go on but in general if

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,519
you are using something under a strong

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,079
copy left license like these licenses

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,440
here

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,680
the expectation is that you're going to

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,560
be giving a lot of source code away

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,759
there is a slightly weaker version of

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,040
these licenses they call

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,880
weak copyleft one that is very familiar

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,240
to people is probably the lesser

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,880
general public license the lgpl or the

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,839
eclipse

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,199
public license known as the epl these

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,919
are very very common

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,000
and they also require sharing of code

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,039
but not as much as the strong copy

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,480
left licenses the weak copyleft licenses

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,720
are typically

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,799
restricted to the code inside the module

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,600
itself the library itself that you're

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,000
using

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,240
and typically does not reach out into

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,840
your application or code outside of that

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,840
module itself

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,200
term that you'll see in the obligations

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,280
around copyleft

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,840
is the corresponding source or the

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,919
corresponding source code bundle

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,080
what this means is the code that you

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,240
need to provide to your customers

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,240
so when you do use these these libraries

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,039
these licensed libraries

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,559
and you need to share your code either

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,360
some or all of your code needs to be

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,880
shared

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,480
and this is commonly through some sort

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,039
of included source bundle

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,919
you'll sometimes hear the term tarball

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,720
or source

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,360
zip or a written offer to deliver that

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,840
code at some later point

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,280
you may provide a download link so

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,960
please click on this link to download

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,640
the zip or tarball

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,520
but for some of the licenses that's not

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,080
sufficient i would say for most people

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,720
that that's a great way to deliver your

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,039
code

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,919
but under some of the licenses you may

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,400
need to

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,360
provide it through a different mechanism

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
and it is important that the

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,200
corresponding

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,679
source is provided in kind of a complete

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,240
way

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,160
it does doesn't mean the source code it

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,160
can mean for many of these licenses to

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,679
include things like the build scripts

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,080
the make files and other other

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,200
scripts that are required to build the

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,880
application itself

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,720
it doesn't typically involve the tool

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
chain like your compiler and things like

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,679
that

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,400
but the make files and other files like

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,039
that that

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,840
are used by those tools may be required

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,840
to be passed along

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,919
there was a license that came out in

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,679
first in the early 2000s and then

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,960
updated in 2007

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,240
called the and that

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,240
was designed to close a loophole so

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,360
many of these many of these libraries

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,080
and licenses

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,120
only come into effect when you share or

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,440
distribute a software product

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,280
as we've moved to software as a service

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,000
and cloud apps

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,360
we're not distributing a classic program

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,480
anymore we're not delivering an

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,559
exe or some sort of binary and so

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,600
new licenses appeared the first one was

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,919
called the afero

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,679
general public license and it this it

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,120
was designed to close that loophole

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,360
so agpl said if you are

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,039
building a software as a service product

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,400
and maybe you do some things maybe you

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,240
modify the code

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
the expectation is that you're going to

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,200
give away and share

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,120
all the source code to your total

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,799
application

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,159
um that was not enough for some

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,080
companies and and these are some

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,280
non-open source licenses that have

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,679
appeared since then that are that are

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,240
not

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,880
open source though are very often

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,400
mentioned

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,720
in the same breath as open source

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,480
licenses that try to also

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,320
close what some people preserve it

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,280
perceive as this loophole

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,960
the idea is that some people build and

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,600
typically we see this in the database

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
world

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,280
these these great databases these

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,039
amazing open source databases

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,720
and then other companies have come in

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,080
typically cloud providers

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,559
and are taking those open source

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,440
databases and selling access

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,120
to running instances of those databases

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,720
and making a lot of money

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,799
and the original products looked at that

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,600
and said well we're not making any money

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,080
off of this

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,520
we see these cloud providers coming in

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,799
how do we stop

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,120
them from just you know

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,480
trivially hosting our software and

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,960
making money

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,760
and what we've seen in the last few

00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,679
years

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,440
is some some new licenses they're not

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,039
open source but again mentioned in the

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,919
same breath as open source

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,039
that try to close again what's perceived

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,280
as a loophole

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,080
some terms and license names that you

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,960
may hear

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,159
are the commons clause the server side

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,760
public license

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,000
and other similar licenses that put

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,440
restrictions on the business case this

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,280
is hosting builds of the original

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,720
software

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,720
you often will see these around what's

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,640
called open core projects

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,000
so cases where the core database say is

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,480
open sourced but a lot

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,280
of tools that are used to run and manage

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,960
that open source

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,640
project maybe are put under a

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,400
proprietary license or a commercial

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,960
license

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,679
so keep an eye out for those if you are

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,320
in the

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,159
business of of hosting applications or

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,080
databases this may be something that's

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,200
very pertinent to you or if you're

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,400
somebody who is using

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,919
a hosted database or is building a

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,919
database into your product

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,240
you should be aware of these these new

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,440
licenses and concerns because i think in

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,360
the database space

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,720
we're going to see a lot of churn in

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,120
licensing we're going to see a lot of

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,760
churn

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,840
in how people manage and host these

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,360
these databases and applications

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,880
as people try to figure out a business

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,799
model around them

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,120
so let's let's walk through a license

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,240
i've picked a short license here this is

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,400
the

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,000
bsd license this is one of the earliest

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
open source licenses

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,080
this is a slightly different version of

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,480
the license a little little newer but

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,400
not

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,520
not that new um it fits on a single

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,400
powerpoint slide

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,799
uh that's that's sometimes a sign of a

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,320
of a great license that you can you can

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,080
read it in an email you can almost fit

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,080
this in a tweet

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,679
so let's walk through this license and

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,000
again this is not legal advice but

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,200
it's something that i find helpful as we

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,840
look at these license and try to

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,840
understand them

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,440
so i've i've colored uh the license

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,440
sentences

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,880
here in a rainbow of colors i've also

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,559
put an arrow next to it if you if you

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,200
have trouble seeing the colors here

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,760
and let's walk through each line one by

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,720
one

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,400
to understand this license so the first

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,280
line that we see is the copyright

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,200
statement

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,280
so when we talk about notices when we

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,159
talk about attribution

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,640
very often that is the line right there

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,919
and it might say copyright 2020

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,320
jeff lush it might say copyright 2020

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,200
the name of an open source project that

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,679
is often

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,880
the copyright statement that you see in

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,559
about boxes

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,000
it's often what is showing up in

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,720
documentation

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,440
and it is an extremely important thing

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
to preserve

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,480
one of the worst things that you can do

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,279
as a developer is to remove a copyright

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,919
statement from some code

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,679
the next line here is a redistribution

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,520
and use permission

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,600
for something to be open source you need

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,919
to have the ability to use it

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,039
and redistribute it and you typically

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,360
want to be able to do that in both

00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,240
source code and binary forms

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,919
with and without modification that's an

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,880
important thing to know it's important

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,960
thing to see

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,240
and then here's the the kind of the

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,240
important clause that says

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,520
provided the following conditions are

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,440
met so

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,919
this is where those obligations get

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,400
shown to us so the author is saying

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,760
great i'm glad you love my software you

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,000
can use it you can do all these things

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,360
with

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,200
it as long as you do the following and

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,559
what i like about the bsd is there's a

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,320
nice numbered list

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,720
of the things that the author wants you

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,120
to do number one

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,080
if you distribute the source code you

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,960
must retain

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,600
the above copyright notice this list of

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,120
conditions

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,559
and the following disclaimer so

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,799
basically saying if you use my software

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,480
and you give away the source code don't

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,440
strip my information give credit where

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,360
credit is due

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,360
keep this license in the text so that

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,880
your users know what their permissions

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,919
are and obligations are

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,520
and they know what code is being used

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,039
number two if you're distributing this

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,480
in binary form

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,400
you also must reproduce the above

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,679
copyright notice this list of conditions

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,120
and the following disclaimer in the

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,880
documentation

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,200
and or materials provided with the

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,000
distribution so if you make an

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,799
executable if you make an app put it on

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,120
an app store

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,200
somebody downloads it expectation is

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,159
that that copyright statement

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,480
and this license and the disclaimer gets

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,880
passed on to the user

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,159
number three uh neither the name or the

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,000
copyright holder or the names of the

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
contributors may be used to endorse or

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,919
promote

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,279
products derived from the software

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,400
without specific prior written

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,720
permission

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,480
this was called a non-endorsement clause

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,120
this basically says please don't tell

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,840
people that

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,120
i love your software i just made you an

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,600
open source library

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,159
i'm not telling you uh i'm not telling

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,159
people

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,880
that your code is great or you shouldn't

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,679
say my code is great because i use

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,320
jeff's library that that is something

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,159
that uh

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,679
they just want to provide the source

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,880
code they want to provide the library

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,600
and they don't want to be involved with

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,080
your marketing

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,200
at all and then lastly there's the

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,600
disclaimer

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,919
very often in all capital letters nice

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,240
big block attacks the wall of text

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,080
it basically says i'm giving you this

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,600
code as is please don't sue me

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,000
not even please don't sue me you can't

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,960
sue me uh i just gave you the code it's

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,320
your job to

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,320
make everything work so this is a a

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,720
really interesting license that shows

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,799
a lot of the things that we we pay

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,159
attention to around obligations

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,320
you notice that it doesn't talk about

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,000
sharing the source code you notice that

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,600
it doesn't talk about business models

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,120
you know it doesn't talk about money

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,880
at all those are all things that are

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,840
either part of commercial licenses or

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,840
different types of open source licenses

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,240
okay another thing that may be

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,440
interesting to you is around

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,640
patents so patents and software patents

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,159
in particular

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,440
are a very hot button topic for people

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,919
there are some people who don't believe

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,000
that software should be

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,520
under the patent law at all there's

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,039
other companies who have made

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,520
thousands and thousands of software

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,080
patents and use their patent portfolios

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,080
to either

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,360
keep competitors out of their space or

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,000
make

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,159
licensing money and things like that so

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,799
patents are definitely a

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,080
concern if you are working in certain

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,399
industries where

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,760
patents are are often used in the

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,279
software world

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,880
or you're using features that often are

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:36,640
patent encumbered so patents are very

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,000
commonly kind of associated with things

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,039
such as

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,960
video compression audio

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,880
compression if you are building an

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,520
application that moves video around the

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,000
internet

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,240
or audio around the internet or doing

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,440
certain things involving with fonts

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,720
or sometimes disk

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,080
disk compression or disk media formats

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,720
these are all things that patents have

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,480
been associated with in recent memory

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,480
so when you if you are in those

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,320
industries or if you're using

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,600
libraries that provide functionality

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,039
like that um

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,200
especially if you're in the hardware

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,600
space uh these are things that

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,520
might make the patent issues kind of

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,360
rise up a little higher than if you

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,559
maybe are not in those industries

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,679
certain licenses

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,720
imply patent permissions

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,480
basically saying if you are

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,640
providing code to the open source

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,399
project the assumption is that you're

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,120
also providing a license to use any

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,520
patents

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,440
that's associated with that code the

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,960
open source projects don't want people

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,720
to give a bunch of code

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,039
get it out into the people people's

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,240
hands and then that original contributor

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,720
to come out and say aha

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,600
you owe us all this money now because

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,640
you're using

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,360
code that infringes on our patent

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,960
so licenses like the apache 2o and the

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,679
mozilla 2o license

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,480
basically say if you give our project

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,000
code

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,240
there's there's a kind of an implied

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,559
license grant around the patents

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,279
we if you give us go do not come out

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
later and

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,640
expect that you're going to be able to

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,640
sue people for using

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,240
patents associated with that code so

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,799
that that provides a protection to the

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,320
projects as well as people who are using

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,080
those projects others again the apache

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,279
2o and mozilla license

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:24,559
are good examples here also

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,640
say if if you are using our code and you

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,760
go out to other people and sue them for

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,320
patents uh patent infringement

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,720
you you will lose your right to to use

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,440
this open source library that's called a

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,840
retaliation a patent retaliation clause

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,360
uh

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,880
basically the license terminates for

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,320
that open source project if you find

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,000
yourself

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,840
in that in that world where you're going

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,919
out and

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,600
enforcing patents on people who are

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,799
using the software and you happen to use

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,720
the software as well

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,640
again it's more complicated than that is

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,080
especially this is a topic that is

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,919
especially important to have your

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,000
your legal staff weigh in on but

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,399
do pay attention to these clauses

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,799
especially if your company has patents

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,399
or is in a space where there may be

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,440
patent encumbered libraries

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,799
or functionality and i can't repeat i

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,559
can't repeat it enough if you're doing

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,080
anything with audio or video

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,880
your developers are doing anything with

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,480
compression it's extremely important i

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,600
can't tell you how many companies i've

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,320
seen

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,520
really get in trouble and have a lot of

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,679
fixing

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,880
of their products because of audio and

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,480
video

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,480
licensing problems around patents

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,399
so another thing that you'll see is dual

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,279
licensing

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,279
what this means is the open source

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:47,279
library they want to use is available

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:49,760
under multiple licenses it may be under

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,720
a open source license or a commercial

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,559
license

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,760
and what's what's great about copyright

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,960
law or what's interesting about

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,080
copyright law is

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,159
it gives you as the author the ability

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,159
to sell the same software or distribute

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,320
the same software to different people

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,159
under different terms you might have

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,399
seen this in the commercial space

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,240
where students can buy

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,080
office packages for pennies on the

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,440
dollar but if you're a corporation and

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,159
you want to buy pretty much that same

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,480
package

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,919
you're going to pay the full price the

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,000
original author there

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,440
gets to choose how they want to license

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,559
and and

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,320
distribute their product open source

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,799
authors have those same permissions

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,720
and very often you'll see them provide

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,159
two or three different licenses for the

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,720
same library

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,880
and there's a couple reasons for this uh

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,600
the main reason that we see

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,440
dual licensing happening in 2020 is

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,559
really as a business model forcing

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,320
function

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,600
what you'll see is that the original

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,240
project will pick

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,240
what may be seen as a scary license

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,039
maybe a license that has a lot of copy

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,880
left

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,240
uh terms in it so maybe something like a

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,640
gpl license

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,919
or more and more these days the afero

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,200
gpl

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,559
license commercial companies typically

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,559
stay away from gpl and agpl for products

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,360
that they're going to distribute

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,000
or host or they'll pick the friendly

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,600
license

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,960
a commercial license just pay us some

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,600
money and you don't have to worry about

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,279
open source licensing or copyleft at all

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,840
and very common as a business model

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,360
forcing function uh it's important for

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,640
your developers to understand

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,640
that just because something's open

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,799
source that doesn't mean

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,840
that it may be perfect for your company

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,039
just to use

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,440
they should be very aware of the

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,200
copyleft implications you should be very

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,600
aware of their distribution

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,799
model talk about that in a couple slides

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,440
and if you do see

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,720
a versus b so license a versus

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,080
commercial

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,440
your assumption should be that that

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,120
first license is something that's going

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,320
to have a lot of copyleft

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,240
obligations typically number two

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,760
and we don't see this as much though you

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,200
will definitely see this in

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,000
legacy code is dual licensing to make it

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,320
clear

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,279
that different communities can use a

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,640
library

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,000
so in the older code you might see

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,440
something where it says this code is

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,200
licensed under gpl

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,880
or mit or mpl gpl or lgpl licenses

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,440
that was very common when there was a

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,200
community that had one license

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,760
and really wanted to use a different

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,679
library and so that libraries

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,200
organization said you know we'll make it

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,399
clear that people can use it under our

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,039
preferred license

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,200
or the license of this other library as

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,039
well so gpl or mit

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,240
most organizations would probably

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,919
typically

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,240
want to use that under an mit license if

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,480
they had a choice a fewer obligations

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,559
fewer things to keep track of and mostly

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,600
that was to make sure that licensing was

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,440
compatible

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,720
between the different libraries that

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,399
might be combined

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,159
you see that less and less these days

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,600
though i think it

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,600
won't be a surprise to see those

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,240
packages live on for decades

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,200
um as some sub components to things

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,120
you've already decided to use

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,600
so a couple more examples that almost

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,799
certainly you are using right now

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,200
in your in your products mysql is

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,800
licensed under a gpl v2

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,079
license or a commercial license mongodb

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,079
another database

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,119
under a server side public license which

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,679
is not open source

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,760
though is is adjacent to the open source

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,599
world or a commercial license

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,760
i text was a gpl or commercial wolf ssl

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,720
which is an encryption library gpl or

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,040
commercial

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,919
those are all the in some ways the

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,200
business model

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,359
forcing function style dual licensing

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,960
a very strong copy left license on the

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,960
left hand side or copy left style

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,720
license on the left-hand side

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,760
or a commercial license on the

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,919
right-hand side

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,040
and then if you look at jquery older

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,520
versions in particular

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,639
they were licensed under gpl or mit that

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,560
was so that the

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,960
jquery library could be used i think

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,119
in various other live libraries without

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,560
any concern about license compatibility

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,880
those questions have pretty much gone

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,839
away and now jqueries is something under

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,839
the mit license

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,920
so let's talk about licensed versions so

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,400
as time goes on

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,320
open source licenses get updated there

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,680
may be a court case there may be

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,400
refinements based on uh use in the field

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,320
there may be some new business model

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
changes that the licenses want to update

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,280
or

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,440
some creaky corners or corner cases that

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,000
they want to make it very clear

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,880
what the license really means and so as

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,800
time goes on

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,560
licenses change and sometimes the

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,760
licenses change and they're denoted with

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,760
a version number

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,240
so the general public license had a

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,400
version one version two version three

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,960
apache license went from version 1 to

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,119
1-1 to 2-0

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,079
the bsd license did not change its

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,720
version number

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,240
but changed the number of clauses the

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,359
numbered clauses that we saw in that

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,280
license before

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,280
one from a four clause to a three-clause

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,960
to a two clause to a one cluster in some

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,040
cases zero clauses

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,880
so these are all things to pay attention

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,079
to just because somebody says it's a gpl

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,079
license

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,760
you may have multiple versions of that

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,119
license to understand

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,960
the bsd might have three four versions

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,520
you need to understand how many clauses

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,240
that you may need to respect

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,880
and some licenses have many variants but

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,800
no differences whatsoever in their names

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,560
very common example of this is the mit

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,880
license has at least

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,520
23 variants no difference whatsoever

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,160
people to say oh it's an mit license

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,040
fedora project has a great listing of

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,800
the 23

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,640
variants of the mit license that they

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,000
have seen and as you remember the mit

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,760
license was one of the earliest open

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,800
source licenses out there started in

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,119
around 1985. it's had now decades

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,720
to basically spread through the open

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,119
source community and get tweaked here

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,920
and there

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,680
things added words changed words removed

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,119
and so on and so on

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,320
what's nice is the mit license is

00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,880
typically a pretty pretty uh

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,240
permissive license but if you haven't

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,760
read it and you're not familiar with

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,960
every word in that license you

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,839
you may get surprised by the things that

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,839
you find it

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,560
so why when do i need to care in the old

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,280
world

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,680
people shipped software you got a

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,079
downloaded it or it came on a disk

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,839
maybe it came on a device that is what

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,160
we call distribution

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,200
it means that the original author has

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,599
provided

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,200
maybe the binary maybe an executable and

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,800
has given it to use through some means

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,400
and many of the open source licenses

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,800
that we've talked about today only come

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,359
into effect when the code is distributed

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,800
so if you're doing software as a service

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,400
you typically don't need to care about

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,920
the mit the bsd

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,200
even the gpl license

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,400
for the code that you're using if you

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,119
are making an app

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,400
if you're making maybe a device or an

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,040
application that people are going to

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,599
download

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,160
you very very much have to pay attention

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,400
to the

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,079
licenses that go inside of it and so

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,720
when you look at your business model

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,599
when you look at your distribution model

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,520
um

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,359
that really affects your policies what

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,000
do you allow what don't you allow

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,680
what do you manage what don't you manage

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,720
so very important to understand

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,320
and it's one of the core questions that

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,480
companies have to struggle with when

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,640
they're looking at licenses and the

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,680
policies

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,240
and they're not clear-cut distribution

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,280
used to be easy we always distribute it

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,400
now

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,480
um there's sometimes some gray areas or

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,520
your business model changes overnight

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,599
so if you're using something for

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,119
internal use that's not

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,800
traditionally seen as a distribution you

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,000
may not need to care about your open

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,520
source licensing

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,760
if you give something distributed to the

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,240
uh end user as a binary

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,079
most definitely is distribution maybe

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,599
you build something into a container

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,599
well if the container is running on your

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,599
servers that's not a distribution

00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:00,320
if it gets pushed to your customers

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,640
machines that is a distribution

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,839
um software as a service if it's all on

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,160
your machines

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,880
not a distribution if it's pushed to the

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,599
cloud

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,640
maybe that amazon or azure google cloud

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,640
platform

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,160
still still run by you maybe not be seen

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,000
as a distribution

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,320
but what happens sometimes is marquee

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,240
customers say we want a private cloud

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,079
version and you suddenly have to push

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,160
that to their devices

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,480
that might be seen as a distribution and

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,320
all those licenses come into effect

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,839
so you have to pay attention

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,280
distribution model

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,599
and you need to understand how your

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,520
model may change with time

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,720
what may be software as a service today

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,160
maybe become

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,280
a push to a device

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,040
at a customer tomorrow and it is at that

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,680
point almost too late

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,760
to get your open source house in order

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,000
and your commercial code house in order

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,000
if it comes after a sale or a contract

00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:59,839
change

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,040
okay um so what looks like open source

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,240
but isn't

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,119
so we've talked a lot about open source

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
licensing today

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,079
we've talked about some things that are

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,760
not like commercial some of the new

00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,359
licenses like the server side or the

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,880
comments clause which are not seen as

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,240
open source licenses

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,160
but there is a big spectrum of licenses

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,560
or quasi licenses that you are going to

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,720
see

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,599
when you're dealing with a real product

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,119
so

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,560
people often use the shorthand saying oh

00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,440
let's talk about open source licensing

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,119
or open source license compliance

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,960
it's not a great term because in general

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,480
it's really licensed compliance

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,240
we're going to talk probably 80 of what

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,680
we're going to deal with is open source

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,680
but 20 25 30 of it is going to be

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,680
not open source but something that

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,480
definitely has to be complied with

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,839
so you're going to know that hey hey

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,440
jeff just wanted to give you a heads up

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,319
sorry for interrupting but we have five

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,520
minutes left

00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,319
okay perfect so i'll finish the slide

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,680
and then we'll go to some questions so

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,520
what looks like open source but isn't

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,520
number one code marked for

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,720
non-commercial use also known as

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,520
nc we see this very often people are

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,160
very concerned about getting either sued

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,760
or they they don't want companies using

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,839
it for some reason

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,800
and they mark it as for non-commercial

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,319
use only

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,359
you often see this in some of the

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:19,040
creative commons style licenses

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,720
the definition of commercial use is hard

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,079
to define but in general if you're doing

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,119
this for work it's probably a commercial

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,000
use

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,440
you probably can't use that um freeware

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,200
or click through eulers

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,480
those are a commercial license they may

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,000
not require

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,560
payment but they require some sort of

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
agreement you may want to understand

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,359
what you click through everybody always

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,720
clicks always accept

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,000
but if you're doing this for commercial

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,200
purposes you probably want to know

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,599
what's in that agreement

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,359
and save that agreement away the one-off

00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,319
licenses like the vanity licenses we

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,000
talked about before

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,359
you may find yourself buying beer for a

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,520
lot of people or getting vaccinated

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,560
understand what your what your terms are

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,319
there

00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,839
sometimes you just see all rights

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,119
reserved

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,880
that doesn't give you permission to use

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,480
it that's basically saying i own the

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,319
copyright for this and i haven't told

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,720
you what the terms are the obligations

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,400
are

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,839
you need to follow up on that and get

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
permission just because it's on the

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,440
internet

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,920
doesn't mean you have permission

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,760
use it and same with no declared license

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,200
it's very common to go to github

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,440
find the source code be able to down the

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,000
source code but if you have permission

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
to use it

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,720
if there's not a license there or

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,839
there's not an author statement saying

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,359
what the permissions are

00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,119
you're not allowed to use it you might

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,079
have visible source but it doesn't mean

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,960
you have

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:37,280
permission to use it and um let me

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,720
let's go to questions right now and then

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,400
at the top of the hour we'll continue

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,599
with the deck here

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,480
so if there's any questions please

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,160
type them into the chat and well i

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,520
believe we also can do audio

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,960
if people feel more comfortable doing

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:58,079
audio and we'll answer any questions

00:42:50,960 --> 00:43:00,720
right now

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,720
people a moment

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,599
so i think we don't have any questions

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,599
i'll go for one or two more minutes here

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,880
we'll then have a break go get a drink

00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,920
get a sandwich

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,319
oh and um okay we have one question here

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,599
from

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,359
tyler atwood um and i'll read this for

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,760
everybody if everybody can't see it

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:29,040
can short software snippets taken from

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,280
help sites such as

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,160
stack overflow be used with a simple

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,800
attribution

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,319
or is there a standard procedure there

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,960
i'll talk more about this in the second

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,359
half

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,000
of today's session we'll talk about

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,079
snippets

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,480
and cutting and pasting but the um

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,599
short answer for for tyler's question

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,040
there about

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,800
snippets and stack overflow all snippets

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,319
for the most part are going to have some

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,280
license it may not be clear what the

00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,520
license is

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,040
but since somebody else wrote it

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,280
especially for commercial purposes

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,119
you're going to want to have

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,400
explicit permission you want to have

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,040
something written down for the future

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,800
about what the permission is there

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,480
for stack overflow it's a very

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,319
complicated situation

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,839
if you go look at the stack overflow

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,280
site and they've changed this back and

00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,040
forth over the years

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,040
and we should double check what it is

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,119
right now but i believe the the

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,040
source code that is provided on stack

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,160
overflow is currently

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,839
a creative commons share a like license

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,920
which we mentioned before on one of the

00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,359
earlier slides is a strong

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,960
copy left license meaning if you use it

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,079
the expectation is you're going to share

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,160
the code to the um

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,160
to the statement there and

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,440
that's usually a problem i've seen

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,359
companies spend

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,440
lots of hours lots of days trying to

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,640
deal with the stack overflow licensing

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,920
question

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,920
i think stack overflow picked that

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,280
license to try to protect their site

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,920
from being

00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,800
copied willy-nilly by competing sites

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,880
but it is a

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,079
is a very difficult license for for

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,599
organizations and companies to deal with

00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,160
because they typically don't want to use

00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:11,119
a share like license for source code

00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,960
okay so and we'll talk more about that

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,720
in the second half

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,880
another another question here from sean

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,000
mckinney is what's the difference

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,920
between a license

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,800
and a copyright so a copyright

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,880
is and again i'm not a lawyer but this

00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,880
is this is my understanding here

00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,800
in many if not you know many countries

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,800
as soon as i put pen to paper

00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,839
and i build something i create something

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,560
some sort of work

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,119
maybe it's a story maybe it's audio a

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,480
song

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:43,760
a movie source code a drawing

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:47,119
i have the copyright that means i own

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,359
the ability to decide how what i created

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,800
is used in the future so that's that's

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:54,560
copyright the kind of the

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:58,400
ownership of the work that you produced

00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:02,319
text audio software pictures et cetera

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,200
a license is a common agreement or an

00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,240
agreement that

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,720
that the author picked to make it clear

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,040
what the

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,720
what the default permissions are to use

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,800
it so instead of having to

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,560
answer an email every day or pick up the

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,160
phone and say yes you have permission no

00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,079
you don't have permission

00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,200
they use something which is called a

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,839
license

00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,839
that gives permission to others to use

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,200
their copy written work

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,680
and ship kind of shows the

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,119
obligations what do you need to do in

00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,880
order to

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:37,200
legally use that work so

00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,160
preserve the notices share the source

00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,839
code

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,200
don't sue me those are all the

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,160
obligations that may show up in the

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,680
license

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,160
for that copyrighted work so that's a

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,599
great great question thank you sean

00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,800
okay um

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,680
and so alexis dickin

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,359
says jeff does it make any sense to

00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,000
change the original files with dual

00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,040
license

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,400
say gpl or mit and limit the header to

00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,079
the license that we would like to use in

00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
our distribution for example the limit

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,640
to

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,160
mit only and we'll talk a little bit

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,480
more about those best practices in the

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,280
second half of the session today

00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,960
i see companies do do a couple things i

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,200
see in some cases where they do change

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,800
that license text

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,040
in the dual license case you may have

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,319
the ability to do that

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,760
what happens there though is it

00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,040
sometimes gets a little hard to manage

00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,839
where you changed it or you didn't

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,319
change it

00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,280
what i do see more commonly is

00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,160
organizations

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,079
will keep that license text the same but

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,800
they'll explicitly either add a note

00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,160
above it

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:41,280
or elsewhere that says for library a

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:44,559
which is available under gpl or mit

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,400
we explicitly pick the mit license

00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,920
um so that's one one thing that

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,839
companies will will do

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,359
sometimes they'll just if you have too

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:54,000
many of them they'll just

00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,040
um just let them be and just assume that

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,880
they're picking the right thing

00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,160
i'm a big fan of explicitly making you

00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,200
know

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,839
someone i know says specific is terrific

00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,440
i i like i like when organizations ex

00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,440
specifically

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:12,319
say what licensing they're using okay

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,079
i see from brittany bell any recommended

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,160
resources

00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,520
reading or reading for small projects or

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,800
small businesses that do not have the

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,480
resources to hire a lawyer who

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,400
specializes in software licenses

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,400
um come in the second half of the the

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,720
session today so in about 10 minutes

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,800
we'll go through some resources and some

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,400
recommendations there so great great

00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,160
participation there so thanks so much

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,760
for that and so brittany stick around

00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,520
for the second half

00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,880
and i think let's see if there's

00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,160
anything

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:44,240
um we should deal with

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:47,599
how about we leave that here for now

00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,800
we'll rejoin in a couple minutes here at

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,040
the top of the hour

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,400
and we'll finish with the um with the

00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,000
session today

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,520
we'll talk a lot about it about the best

00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,240
practices for organizations we're going

00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,440
to move from

00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,280
the specific licensing to compliance and

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,280
remediation which means fixing

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,559
talk about security and some of the

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,240
resources that might exist

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,400
for organizations to learn more about

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,000
this and to train their developers

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,160
so keep up with the questions these

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,400
questions really help so

00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,839
keep them keep them coming and let's

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,680
rejoin on the stay

00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,040
keep this session open for 10 minutes

00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,440
and we'll rejoin and have the second

00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,880
half of the talk

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,839
thank you very much thanks for attending

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,520
today and see you in town

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,160
thank you guys and as jeff mentioned we

00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:33,599
will reconvene back at two o'clock today

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:45,839
thank you i'm sorry three o'clock at the

00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:45,839
top of the hour three o'clock

00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,079
if you are just joining us right now and

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,559
you didn't see the first half

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,079
i promise you that you'll be able to uh

00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,240
join us in motion here

00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,680
and it should hopefully all make sense

00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,160
so if you're just joining us

00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,319
uh fresh this is open source licensing

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,599
types strategies and compliance my name

00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,040
is jeff lush

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:12,319
and you can reach me either through

00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:14,240
twitter or through my website there

00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,559
i'm going to skip my my intro here i

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,200
think most of you heard that already

00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,319
and we will continue with our discussion

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,200
about compliance

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,880
security and best practices and we have

00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,079
about 45 minutes today

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,640
to complete this session and hopefully

00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,680
we'll

00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,200
get through that and we'll have a little

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,200
time for q a at the end

00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,720
so we spent the first session talking

00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,280
about

00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,599
open source licensing talked about

00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,240
contracts talked about copyrights

00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,000
i think it's important to talk about the

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,319
public domain

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,200
this is a phrase that you will see and

00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:51,680
hear

00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,680
all over the place and it is often used

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,000
as magic words i can't tell you how many

00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,720
developers have used the term public

00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,880
domain

00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,079
when they really mean open source or

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,839
they really mean

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,480
i just want to use it i don't i got it

00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:08,160
on the internet it's public domain

00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:12,720
it has a very very specific legal

00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,720
definition but it also has kind of a

00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,040
folklore definition especially around

00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,599
open source

00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,119
so if you hear the term public domain if

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,119
you see the words public domain written

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,119
down or developer says yes we can use

00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:27,920
this library it's public domain

00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,359
i would spend some extra time and you

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,040
what you want to do is you want to see

00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:35,040
explicit written

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,240
evidence that it truly is public domain

00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,400
so the idea of

00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,000
public domain is there's no license

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,559
there's no copyright do whatever you

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,319
want with it

00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,079
that is true there are certain things

00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,040
that are have either been released into

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,520
the public domain

00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,599
or are so old that they don't have

00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,359
copyright associated with them anymore

00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,880
but with with the changes in copyright

00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:57,920
law

00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,200
copyright lasts for a long time and it's

00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,280
it's hard to find

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,040
code that is that is not under copyright

00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,240
or has not explicitly been released in

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,480
the copyright

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,800
into the public domain so definitely pay

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,880
attention to it and watch out for

00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,720
scary things so the phrase here this

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,599
code is licensed to the public domain

00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,400
under the gpl license that is just a

00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,880
horror show

00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,760
of a sentence public domain says there's

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,240
no copyright

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,040
the the gpl license requires copyright

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,240
to work

00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,920
you you you don't want to see people

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,359
mixing those terms

00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,200
that is a case where the person is

00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,079
trying to use public domain to mean open

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,800
source

00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,319
so pay attention to that be very wary

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,880
around public domain

00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,079
and some countries don't recognize the

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,440
public domain

00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,599
you can't put something into the public

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,280
domain in some countries and what you

00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:49,359
see more and more these days

00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,520
is a creative commons xero cc0 license

00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,559
has been made by the creative commons

00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,240
organization which is a great

00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,720
organization should take a look at them

00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,240
around licensing content especially

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,359
non-source content

00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,800
but the cc0 license is

00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:06,960
a open source license that has

00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,839
been designed to really act like the

00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,359
public domain

00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,440
basically say there's there's no

00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,839
permissions or obligations required

00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,640
to use this content code whatever it may

00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:16,160
be so

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,400
pay attention that it's also a great

00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,760
license if you're ever looking for

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:24,000
images or sounds for talks it's a great

00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,839
great create a great license to look for

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,960
content

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:31,359
so when don't we know enough so we just

00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,920
were talking about the creative commons

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,720
on the last slide creative commons is a

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,240
family

00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,680
of licenses it's not a single license

00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,520
so if somebody says this is licensed

00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,960
under the creative commons

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,559
you don't know enough because the

00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,160
creative license creative commons

00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,400
licenses range from

00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,800
cc0 which is very similar to the public

00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,680
domain no copyright no licenses

00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,240
no obligations all the way to creative

00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,200
commons

00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,319
share alike which is a strong copy left

00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,720
license

00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,480
you don't know what just cc creative

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,559
commons license means without that

00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,000
extra content so if you see that it's

00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,599
creative commons licensed

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,839
you need to click and go a little deeper

00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,520
to find out what what part of the family

00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:14,160
is it truly there

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,040
um the code is on github i got the code

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,480
from github

00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,640
that doesn't mean you have just

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,640
permission to download it and use it

00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,920
more and more code on github does have

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,119
good licensing

00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,599
uh they've tried to enforce a

00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,640
kind of when you create a project pick a

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,359
license

00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,040
feature of github and other other code

00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:35,440
repositories like that

00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,640
but still i can put code on github and

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,559
not explicitly

00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,720
pick a license or put a license file

00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,559
there and especially old content there

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,400
does not have licensing so just because

00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,359
it's available you downloaded it from

00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,040
the internet you got it

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,359
on github doesn't mean that it has a

00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,079
license or your permissions

00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:53,200
another kind of creaky corner for people

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,040
is when they get code from their

00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,000
suppliers or they get it from as part of

00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,240
an sdk

00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,680
software development kit you buy a piece

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,960
of hardware or you're working in a

00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,200
certain ecosystem

00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,440
and you get an sdk a code package from

00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,200
them well is it open source

00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,359
is it commercial do you have to pay for

00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,000
it these are all good questions to ask

00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,440
and

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,839
very often especially if you're working

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,640
in like the iot space or automotive

00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:17,119
space

00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,079
you're going to get an sdk that is part

00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,040
commercial

00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,000
part open source and part very open

00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,119
source containing

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,520
strong copyleft license linux code

00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,280
gpl code etc so you're going to end up

00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,359
with a stew of licensing

00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,799
and you really need to understand what

00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,640
the licenses are so if you're dealing

00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,799
with hardware at all

00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,799
pay very a lot of attention to licensing

00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:40,640
especially the gpl licensing there

00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,000
and if you're in certain industries like

00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,640
automotive

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,359
aerospace anything dealing with iot or

00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,559
hardware

00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,880
you're probably going to find yourself

00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,880
on more on the copyleft

00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,400
side of the world and then you some

00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,960
people say we bought a license well

00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,640
maybe they bought a license 15 years ago

00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,480
do they still have a license to the to

00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,400
the current version what about bug

00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,240
bug fixes etc so when you go through

00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,880
your go through your bill of materials

00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,880
the list of

00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,920
libraries you're using all good

00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,440
questions to ask

00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,960
around open source around things that

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,680
are not open source things aren't

00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,359
commercial

00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,720
you want to know what the current state

00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:15,680
of your licensing is whether it's

00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,200
commercial open source or in between

00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,440
so how have things changed over the

00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,359
years so

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,880
if you went back in time to 2000 2004

00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,559
um everybody was using what was called

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,400
the lamp stack

00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:32,559
so linux apache mysql php

00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,480
maybe you had a couple dozen software

00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,040
components

00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,359
move to 2010 you know move to platform

00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,480
as a service maybe move to amazon azure

00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:43,200
or google

00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,400
you might be using 500 libraries 500

00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,799
components

00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,200
now in 2020 people are using the mean

00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,200
stack

00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:54,720
microservices all this javascript

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,160
mongodb other databases behind the

00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,119
scenes

00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:01,040
you might have 5 000 software components

00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,079
um if you're in automotive

00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:07,119
maybe even more than that that is a lot

00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,920
of stuff to keep track of um if if those

00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,559
were bolts

00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,000
and nuts and widgets you couldn't even

00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,000
you know you'd have trouble

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,760
figuring out what you're using software

00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,119
is even harder to manage it's hidden

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,280
behind the scenes it doesn't always

00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,440
scream out ownership or licensing

00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,119
so we have a lot of work ahead of us

00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,079
here

00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:28,079
and how did we get how do we go from a

00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,559
couple dozen components to

00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:32,160
thousands and thousands of components

00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,960
one of the biggest changes was

00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,240
the use of repository managers so if you

00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,160
if you're on a development team or

00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,760
you're managing a development team

00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,079
almost certainly they're using something

00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,480
like maven npm

00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,599
pip artifactory there's a million of

00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,760
these things

00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,040
uh especially each ecosystem has a

00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,480
different one so you may be using

00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,640
multiple ones of these

00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,480
this is where the developer says i want

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,440
to use this library i want to use this

00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,359
component

00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,440
please go download it for me at build

00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:01,280
time and oh by the way download

00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,480
all of its dependencies and the things

00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,480
it needs to work

00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,000
automatically so you might have pulled

00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,680
in one library

00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,640
and 20 50 100 come along that you never

00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,559
even knew their name

00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,640
you never even knew the licensing you

00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,280
you hope that the licensing is fine you

00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,520
hope that

00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,559
everything else is great but it isn't

00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,400
always so

00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,000
repository managers definitely have

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,599
added another zero

00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,839
if not two zeros to the number of

00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,680
libraries that we have to manage

00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,440
and then there's the classic ways that

00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,160
people download code you're gonna find

00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,440
that

00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,720
even if you're using a repository

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,000
manager people are gonna go out and

00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,079
directly download

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,520
some sort of source archive from the web

00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,160
go to github git lab

00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,839
a project site they might be using a

00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,480
magic shell script they download

00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,960
something

00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,000
and they're using a make file or cmake

00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,680
or something like that

00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,280
the next thing you know it's going out

00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,280
and doing a bunch of

00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,040
wget or curl statements and it's

00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,280
downloading a whole bunch of source code

00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,400
that you never even knew about things to

00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,920
watch

00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,040
earlier in the previous session we had a

00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,400
question about cutting and pasting

00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,440
snippets

00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,720
very very common it's difficult to

00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,920
manage we have a couple slides about

00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,359
that in a little bit

00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,760
um copied from a paste bin or a gist

00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,799
this is a very common where you have

00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,760
projects that are not

00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,640
complicated enough to be a open source

00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,200
project

00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,920
but they're useful very often you're

00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,280
going to find them

00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,960
on something called a paste bin or a

00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,000
google

00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,839
add-on web search or a github

00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,040
gist which is just a single page with a

00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:31,359
bunch of code on it

00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:33,520
these all require licenses as well and

00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,520
they're very often something that is

00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,280
kind of not treated as open source even

00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,520
though it is

00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,280
you may find that your javascript is

00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,119
downloading things from a cdn

00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,200
a content delivery network maybe it

00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,520
never even shows up on your hard drive

00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,440
but your developer your users see it

00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,240
when your developers push this code out

00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,680
to the internet

00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,200
so something to pay attention to a lot

00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,799
of the stuff on the cdns are going to be

00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,280
under an mit license

00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:59,200
but for security and just licensing you

00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,960
should know what's coming out there

00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,400
i'm bundled with other open source

01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,920
projects

01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,040
this is where a lot of code comes in

01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,680
that people just don't know how to

01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,839
manage

01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,760
you you bring in a library and it brings

01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,079
in 100 other things or you purchase a

01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,000
live

01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,520
something from a commercial entity and

01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,160
it has a whole bunch of open source in

01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,160
it

01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,680
this is some of the toughest stuff to

01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,880
manage both from a licensing and a

01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,240
security perspective and again we'll

01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,280
talk a lot a little bit about that

01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,040
later infrastructure what are you where

01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,880
is your operating systems coming from

01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,760
where are your databases running what

01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,799
did you pick for your cues and et cetera

01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,480
these are questions asked your

01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,680
developers not just what libraries

01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,040
they're selecting but what

01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,680
infrastructure pieces are

01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,839
they grabbing and then your vendors and

01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:43,520
suppliers they're a big part of what you

01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:44,799
end up using and all of this wrapped

01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,400
together if you take all those things

01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:49,280
that were on the previous slide

01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,720
we call this the software supply chain

01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,040
and so it's very similar to a physical

01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,359
supply chain so if you're building a car

01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,920
and you look at your engine you break

01:00:55,359 --> 01:01:00,400
the engine down into parts and modules

01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,680
and that module the starter make it come

01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,079
from one company

01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:05,680
that starter might have wire from

01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,760
another company and

01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,760
grommets from another company and lug

01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,839
nuts from another company and metal

01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,440
housings from another company and so on

01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,960
and so on and so on and track it back

01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,160
like a family tree

01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,799
five levels 10 levels or more you may

01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,359
have

01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:22,400
hundreds of suppliers for your project

01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,680
for your company

01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,760
you may have thousands if you're

01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,000
building um software that goes into like

01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,440
an

01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,280
iot device or an automotive um display

01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,200
and layers and layers of complexity

01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,160
layers of suppliers this is very

01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,839
difficult to manage

01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,000
i think our industry is struggling with

01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:39,599
this right now we see a lot of

01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,599
software to help manage this but even

01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,960
still it's difficult to manage

01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,640
and again as we talked about it's a

01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,040
mixture of open source commercial

01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,559
and free there's software components

01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,480
there's tool chains there's

01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:52,400
documentation there's utilities

01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,079
all this gets mixed together and it's a

01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,920
mess it's just a mess

01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,520
you very often don't have any access or

01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,720
contact with your suppliers you might

01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,000
not know their names

01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,359
or you might know their name but they

01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
don't answer your email you don't even

01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:03,599
have a phone

01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,799
phone number for them and you might not

01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,119
even know who they are i can't tell you

01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,880
how many people depend on code

01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,559
that they didn't know they were using

01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,720
don't know where it came from

01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,920
and the person doesn't even have a name

01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,520
doesn't even have an email address it

01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,440
just has like a pseudonym

01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,960
in the source code and it's running on

01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,680
millions of devices

01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,880
so it's definitely a journey of a

01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,079
million steps

01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,440
but you do have to get it started to

01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:27,520
figure out what code you're using and

01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,359
where it comes from

01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,359
so let's talk about how you manage that

01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:34,319
so you know you have now dozens

01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:36,160
hundreds thousands of components being

01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,680
used

01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,640
you know your developers didn't do a

01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,559
great job pulling all together

01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,640
so you need to clean it up you also need

01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,319
to stem the bleeding keep problems from

01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,520
continuing to happen and one of the big

01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,880
ways of doing that is making what's

01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:52,480
called an open source

01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:54,000
license policy and what this says is

01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,680
for all these different licenses we

01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,039
talked about a bunch of them today

01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,440
you're going to give a thumbs up or a

01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,039
thumbs down for each use case

01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,640
so if we're building a product and we're

01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:03,440
going to distribute a binary to our

01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,200
customer

01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,799
we're going to allow these licenses and

01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,720
we're going to not allow

01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,839
these other licenses so you're going to

01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,480
have a

01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:14,160
approved list and a rejected list it may

01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,799
depend on your distribution model

01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,799
so you might allow a compiler in with a

01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:20,160
very strong copy left license

01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,000
but since it's not being shipped to your

01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,160
customers you're going to allow it

01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,920
but you wouldn't allow that same license

01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,280
to be attached to some library that gets

01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,640
shipped to your customers

01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,839
so you're going to go through your

01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,119
models you're going to go through the

01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,559
licenses you're going to have a bunch of

01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,079
licenses that you love a bunch of

01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,599
licenses that you hate

01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,599
a bunch of licenses that you don't even

01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,000
know about until you start

01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,680
reviewing what your developers are using

01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,119
so set a policy

01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:45,280
spend a little bit of time figuring out

01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,880
what your model is thumbs up thumbs down

01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,359
it's a great place to bring your

01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,079
your lawyers involved but you need to

01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,039
update it

01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,160
so you're going to put it out to your

01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,599
developers you're going to find out all

01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,640
sorts of things about your developers

01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,599
are actually using

01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,280
you're going to look at all the

01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,880
libraries that you're using we call it

01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,000
your bill of materials

01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,359
and you're going to find licenses that

01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,720
you never even knew you had you're going

01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,559
to sit down with your lawyer and you can

01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,920
give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down

01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,599
and if something gets a thumbs down you

01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,359
might have to rip it out we call that

01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,440
remediation or fixing

01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,559
and it's very expensive to fix code

01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,200
after the fact

01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,440
so as we all know bugs bugs are cheap to

01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,280
fix in development they're hard to fix

01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,440
when they've gone out to customers and

01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,839
especially open source license bugs

01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,880
are extremely difficult to fix at a

01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,240
later point

01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,160
you're going to find yourself spending a

01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,920
lot of money to fix something after the

01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,160
fact

01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,280
a great example go out to

01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,799
opensource.google and look at their docs

01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,799
for their third-party licenses

01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:38,960
they give a great example of their

01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,720
policy for their use of open source

01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,160
licenses and their products there it's a

01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,680
really good thing to look at

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,520
i'm a big fan of looking at what other

01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,960
large companies are doing

01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,200
because they have they spend millions of

01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,880
dollars on lawyers and policies and

01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,760
agreements and they've learned hard

01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,160
lessons

01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,200
and so if you see what google microsoft

01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,119
adobe

01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,480
others are doing around licensing and

01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,000
policies

01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,680
might not work for you but it at least

01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,280
gives you a good good understanding

01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,200
about how large companies are managing

01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,839
this

01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,799
so let's again let's again look at what

01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,720
is google doing

01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,720
around compliance so in our first

01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,960
session we talked about notices

01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,079
and how to pass on notices there's a

01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,599
great example of

01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:19,200
probably on the very machine that you're

01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,000
watching this on right now

01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,119
of open source compliance notices so if

01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,079
you have a copy of

01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,880
google chrome it will probably be very

01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,799
similar to other

01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,640
web browsers that you're using and you

01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:33,760
open up the about box

01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:36,319
you're going to see in the about box

01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,039
a link says okay google chrome copyright

01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:39,280
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:41,200
all rights reserved google chrome is

01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,240
made possible by the chromium open

01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,119
source project and

01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,480
other open source software so that blue

01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:48,079
link there

01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,319
is very exciting we want to click on

01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:51,760
that blue link and see what other open

01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:53,280
source software google is going to be

01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,480
giving credit to

01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,720
when they build google chrome

01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,640
so if you go to your about box click on

01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:03,200
that and click on your blue link

01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,920
and you will see page after page after

01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:09,680
page of open source library names

01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:11,440
in the group chrome credits page

01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,520
starting with absell and going all the

01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,079
way to zeela our favorite favorite

01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,119
library there and each of these gets

01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,960
called out

01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:20,640
in this case just name you don't see the

01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,880
version some organizations will actually

01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,480
put the version number there as well but

01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,000
this is the name of all these libraries

01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,760
that google chrome uses

01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,160
there's a link to show the license and

01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,079
then a link to show the home page which

01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,520
is a nice thing it's not required under

01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,000
a lot of the licenses

01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,440
but it gives credit where credit's due

01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,720
and it also helps

01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,880
draw people's attention to these

01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,319
libraries maybe give them a little

01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:46,720
extra support and visibility uh

01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:48,799
if if you're if the libraries you depend

01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,920
on are getting a lot of visibility

01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:51,599
in the open source world in the

01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,640
commercial world and getting a lot of

01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,799
support

01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,319
it's best for you it's better for you

01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:58,480
you're you don't have to spend

01:06:56,319 --> 01:07:00,880
more time working on the open source

01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,799
level you can spend more time working on

01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,400
your commercial code on your project

01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,960
code so you see that that's the list of

01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,799
names

01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,319
license links and home page links and if

01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:11,599
we click on one

01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:13,119
zlib for example we will see the actual

01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,079
license text

01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,839
this is a z-lib license it tells us

01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:19,839
version 1.2.11

01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:21,119
from 2017 that's the latest and greatest

01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:23,119
version of zlib

01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,960
and this is the the z-lib license you

01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,200
see the copyright statement just like in

01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,559
the bsd license we saw before

01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,559
in this case here there's kind of this

01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,039
as is

01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,640
you know no warranty disclaimer at the

01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,799
top instead of the bottom

01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,799
and then a three clause list of

01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,799
obligations and permissions

01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:42,880
very common to see this is a great

01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,960
example of providing notices to your end

01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,480
users a big big fan of this giving

01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,680
credit for credit stu

01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,520
most companies do a horrible job of of

01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,039
showing their notices and attribution

01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,960
requirements so

01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:57,039
if you can do this from the beginning

01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,319
you're ahead of everybody

01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,520
so we've talked about licenses we've

01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:04,160
talked about

01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:06,240
uh kind of compliance and doing the

01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:09,119
right thing and setting policies

01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,640
but licensing is only half the question

01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,960
uh

01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,960
all software has bugs open source

01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,680
software is it better is it worse you

01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,199
know people

01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,199
people are gonna say open source is

01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:20,640
better because it has more eyes on it

01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:22,239
some people are gonna say open source is

01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,839
worse because there's more

01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:25,440
ability to go look at it and it's

01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:27,759
everywhere um i'm

01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:29,920
i'm kind of neutral on that but there is

01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:32,080
a a

01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,359
a concern around security around all

01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,279
software and what's

01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,080
great about open source is there are

01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,960
great lists of known vulnerabilities

01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,400
known bugs that exist in the open source

01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,960
libraries so if you go to this great

01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,719
site called

01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:47,199
cve.miter.org this is a can give you a

01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,839
list

01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:52,799
of public

01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:54,080
vulnerabilities they're all going to be

01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:57,759
given a name or a number

01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,679
cve 2020 001 and so on and so on

01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:02,080
and you can then discuss the

01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,000
vulnerabilities using that common naming

01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,679
scheme and understand what the problems

01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,120
are what

01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:09,040
how to fix it in some case it's

01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,640
basically a red alert if you see these

01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,759
starting to appear

01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,640
in the software libraries that you're

01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:16,239
using many other library

01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,319
defects don't get this level of

01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:20,400
visibility you only get a cve

01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,000
in certain cases if you go to the

01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,679
project homepage you may find

01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,199
tons of vulnerabilities that are never

01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:28,000
named never given a

01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:29,279
acute logo or anything like that and

01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,239
they're really hard to identify they're

01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,719
harder for

01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:34,560
code and scanners to automatically find

01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:35,839
so for all the libraries you're using

01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,279
you want to pay attention to

01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,719
vulnerabilities you want to see if

01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,600
they're showing up on the vulnerability

01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,799
lists

01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,520
and you're going to want to be wanting

01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:44,400
to be looking in their own bug trackers

01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,839
to see

01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,960
kind of the ebb and flow of security

01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:50,239
issues

01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,640
there are some very famous

01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:55,280
vulnerabilities that are out there

01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,159
in the industry heartbleed and struts

01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:59,040
are two

01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:00,640
open source libraries that the everybody

01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,239
loves everybody uses

01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,640
but had some very significant

01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,840
vulnerabilities that kind of affected

01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,120
the whole world

01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:11,280
so back in 2014 heartbeat heartbleed

01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:14,560
which affected the heartbeat feature of

01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:18,000
openssl which is an encryption library

01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,719
basically allowed arbitrary code to be

01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,800
run

01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,000
pretty much anywhere you wanted and this

01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,600
was very serious

01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:29,280
this this led to many vulnerabilities

01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:31,840
led to lots of remediation and fixing

01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,679
and we still find cases of that the

01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,880
broken version of that library still

01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,320
hanging out there

01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,560
because it's hard to update it's hard to

01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:41,440
find struts is

01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,880
another great library comes from apache

01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,640
used by

01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,920
tons of projects 2017 a vulnerability

01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,480
was found

01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,920
and if you all remember the equifax

01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,920
breach

01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,360
they basically were using struts as part

01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,960
of their web app

01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:02,640
and were attacked by outside hackers

01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:04,080
and basically had all their data stolen

01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,239
through the use of this vulnerable

01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,840
component there was really nothing

01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,360
wrong with struts compared to other

01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,400
libraries it's just that it had a

01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:13,040
vulnerability that

01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,880
had a very serious problem that that

01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,400
people were able to attack

01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,840
so when we pay attention to these

01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,360
libraries and these vulnerabilities we

01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,560
want to make sure that we

01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,800
know what the ebb and flow of

01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,440
vulnerabilities are and as we design our

01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,880
products

01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,719
it's always good to understand how we're

01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,000
using open source and are we able to

01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,120
kind of fire all

01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,239
firewall off features or data

01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:37,440
if we suddenly have a vulnerability

01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:38,719
so let's talk about how we fix um one of

01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,920
the big dangers of open source

01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,440
vulnerabilities is that they can be

01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,040
scripted so i might not just be

01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,120
targeting your company

01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,199
i might be targeting all companies and i

01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,000
might just crawl the internet

01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:51,760
trying to exercise a defect let's see if

01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,679
company a has a struts problem

01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,600
company b has a stretch problem and so

01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:58,080
on and so on and when they

01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:00,080
find a way in they get in they can let

01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,800
scripts do this automatically overnight

01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,719
over the weekend so you because open

01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,600
source is ubiquitous in everywhere

01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:08,880
it's a very common target for attackers

01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,239
it doesn't have to be your company

01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,880
particularly under attack but if you're

01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,120
found

01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,480
they'll take advantage of it someone in

01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,159
the industry once said

01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,480
components open source components age

01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:21,040
like milk not like wine

01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,480
and i love that phrase uh because what

01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,960
it means is like as open source

01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,840
as all libraries get older they kind of

01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,000
age out

01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,440
new attacks are found bugs are found and

01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,880
people are able to attack them so kind

01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,840
of you want to keep things current as

01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,400
best you can

01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,000
and just kind of pay attention um one of

01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:38,159
the best ways to upgrade and

01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,760
fix is you just upgrade you upgrade to

01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:41,440
the latest safe release

01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,760
and that may be great for fixing the

01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,360
vulnerability it may lead to problems

01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:49,440
with license changes

01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:51,679
or compatibility with apis

01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,560
brings in unwanted features or memory

01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,719
bloats

01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,320
if you're an iot device it may require

01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,320
more disk space or memory

01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:01,840
by upgrading these all may be problems

01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:03,360
un unintended side effects of upgrading

01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,760
you may need to learn how to block

01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:09,040
attacks before you can upgrade

01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:11,040
put in firewall rules or layers

01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,960
between the outside world and your

01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,679
product and you need to have a plan

01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,320
the worst time to figure out how to fix

01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:18,159
these things

01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,000
is when there's a red alert try to do

01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:22,400
this day to day build it into your

01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,040
your culture of staying on top of things

01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,400
and

01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,120
validating these upgrades and

01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,120
vulnerabilities

01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:31,120
another big change has been the customer

01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,960
visibility

01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:35,760
of these vulnerabilities of the

01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:38,159
visibility so customers are now running

01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,280
scanners or their security teams are

01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,560
looking at your products and they're

01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,400
saying great

01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,679
um we'd love to buy your product we'd

01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,719
love to use your product

01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:46,800
you know what we're going to run it

01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,239
through our dynamic application security

01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,080
testing product or das

01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:52,000
product or our software composition

01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,520
analysis product which is

01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,280
used to discover open source components

01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,880
and the vulnerabilities we have our

01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,880
human team we're going to look at it

01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,239
let's go figure out what's going on

01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,800
they're going to find a bunch of

01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,560
problems

01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,320
just the very nature if you're a small

01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,159
company you go give your code

01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,480
your product to a big company they have

01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:11,040
a lot of experience in finding problems

01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,080
and through the use of dast and sca and

01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,760
human teams

01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,280
they're going to find a laundry list of

01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,880
things to fix especially if it's the

01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,239
first time that you've had your product

01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,600
go through one of these

01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:23,040
these scans they will expect you to fix

01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,760
the most egregious issues they're going

01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,159
to want to hear

01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,600
a timetable a plan they might not let

01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:29,360
things go live

01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,640
until you fix these things they might

01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,199
not let it go live at all they're going

01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,040
to have two

01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:35,440
two different companies and they say

01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,640
company a either had no problems or fix

01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,840
their problems we're gonna go with them

01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,239
even if they're more expensive

01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,679
we can't afford to have big bugs running

01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,440
in our product

01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:45,520
they'll make open source disclosures

01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,280
part of the contract so even before you

01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,199
sell your license to somebody they're

01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,320
going to say give us a disclosure list

01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:52,320
give us your list of open source

01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,360
dependencies and red flags are going to

01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,280
make them walk away

01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,800
if you can't give a disclosure list or

01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,040
if it's really old

01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,320
or it's got just you know licenses that

01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,760
shouldn't be there

01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,679
they're going to say this is this is a

01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:05,440
we don't want to buy a bad problem

01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,880
so pay attention to this this is

01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,000
something if you were selling software

01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,640
in 2020

01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
the expectation is that large companies

01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,600
public companies are going to run you

01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,960
through this process

01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,960
before they let you go live

01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,480
so you've heard me use the term

01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,840
remediation a lot that's that's

01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,960
basically a 500

01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,159
word for fixing so remediation is a word

01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,239
that you hear for the open source

01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:30,640
licensing world the security world

01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:31,920
comes up over and over again it's always

01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,360
better to build an open source

01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,440
management in new products

01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,600
so if you're starting something today

01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:40,480
brand new product at your company

01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,080
bring in software composition analysis

01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,600
bring in open source policy right from

01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,040
the very beginning don't let an open

01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,600
source library come in

01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,960
without running it through a process if

01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,280
you can make something clean from the

01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,320
very beginning it is so much easier

01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,600
to build and just produce and pass all

01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:58,480
those tests

01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,640
if you have a mature product something

01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,159
that's been around for years or decades

01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,800
it can be very difficult and very

01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:06,640
expensive to fix but so is doing nothing

01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,400
you know if you have a version of struts

01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,080
sitting in your product and you don't

01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,560
know it's there that can be very

01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,320
expensive for you to ignore

01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,840
um legal concerns sometimes get in the

01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,120
way of the technical analysis so

01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,480
sometimes the legal team is going to say

01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,640
we don't want to look at that project

01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,480
it's been fine nobody's nobody's

01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:26,239
complaining we don't want to look

01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:28,480
uh you know that there's pluses and

01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,920
minuses to that i'm usually a big fan of

01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,400
trying to understand what your problems

01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,320
are

01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,080
you want to you want to know what your

01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,520
known problems are and not just have

01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,600
them come out of left field

01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,760
those are company killing events those

01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,760
are very expensive

01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,280
oddball licenses lead to very large

01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,800
legal bills so if you can stay away from

01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,120
those weird licenses

01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,080
you're gonna not have to deal with the

01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,920
legal analysis

01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,600
both on your side or on the other side

01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,080
of the table

01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,920
gpl violations cases where you're using

01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,920
strong copyleft code where you shouldn't

01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,840
be can be very expensive fix

01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,600
the code that's under the gpl license is

01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:04,080
typically awesome code

01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,040
and does a lot and rip it out means you

01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,280
may have to

01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,640
rewrite a huge project or go find

01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,280
something that provides the same

01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:13,120
functionality it's very difficult to do

01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,719
commercial violations as well can be

01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:16,159
very very expensive to fix so if you

01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,280
take somebody's database and you haven't

01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,560
paid for it

01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,480
and you've shipped it all around the

01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,400
world on embedded devices

01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,600
you may find yourself with an extremely

01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,080
large bill

01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,920
so it's better to not ship other

01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,480
people's code in places that you

01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,000
can't afford and your suppliers don't

01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,199
have to respect your timetable so you

01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,880
might be using somebody's

01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:36,880
commercial code that has an open source

01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,719
problem in it vulnerability in it and

01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,560
you say oh we can't close the big deal

01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:42,239
that we want to because your code

01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,000
which we purchased from you has a

01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,679
problem

01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,280
they might not be able to fix it in time

01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:48,400
or they won't answer it or maybe they're

01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,640
not around anymore

01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,800
so you should be doing this same process

01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,960
with all your commercial suppliers

01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,400
and try it ahead of time make sure that

01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,960
they have their act together and that

01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,120
you have

01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,040
good communication channel with them so

01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,560
that if it becomes a problem

01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,640
you know how to talk with them and get

01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,760
your things fixed

01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,960
so let's talk a little bit more about

01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,960
working with suppliers

01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:12,400
try to select vendors who can provide a

01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,840
current bill of materials if they can't

01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,040
give you a current bill of materials

01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,679
instantly

01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,880
today tomorrow they're probably not a

01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,840
supplier who could do that in an

01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,000
emergency

01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,440
you want somebody who can give you that

01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,560
bill of materials that bomb

01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:28,320
right away there's a new organization

01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,679
and certification called open chain

01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,159
we'll talk about that a little bit later

01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,840
on

01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:33,520
but it's basically a way of managing

01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:36,239
open source in your organization

01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,520
it's a really great thing to be uh and

01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:39,840
shows that you're doing the right things

01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,520
internally about managing open source

01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,159
trying to have a service level gate

01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,760
agreement an sla for security fixes ip

01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,760
fixes alerts

01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,520
you don't want to find out from your own

01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,600
customers that you have a bug from

01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,120
something that came from your supplier

01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,280
and you maybe want to make this a

01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,239
contract term whenever contracts are up

01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,080
for a sale

01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:59,440
that's your best time if you're buying

01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,719
somebody else's software

01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,280
probably want to negotiate with you if

01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,800
they want that sale the other size sales

01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:07,679
people are your best partner

01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:09,440
to get things changed if you can do

01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,840
validation tests on code from vendors

01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,960
using

01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:15,199
sca and dast tools when possible

01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,239
but do remember the buck stops with you

01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,600
if you sell

01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:20,640
or running software your customers going

01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,840
to look at you they're not going to

01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,600
listen when you say oh it's not our

01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,600
fault that's our supplier gave us this

01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,040
bug or gave us this ip issue

01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,719
intellectual property issue license

01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,239
issue they don't care they just know

01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,760
that they can't use their product or

01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:33,520
all their information was stolen or

01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,760
their financial

01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,560
world was impacted so you are

01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,120
responsible

01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,719
and remember that so how do we get

01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,560
compliant how do we how do we

01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,560
how do we make our companies good at

01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,800
this well first thing is you want to

01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,960
build a team of open source experts

01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,880
it is great to have everybody educated

01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,480
here but again the buck needs

01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,000
to stop with somebody if there's not a

01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,520
couple people in your company who are

01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,840
responsible for this

01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:00,480
it's not going to get done you always

01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:02,800
want to have a bill of materials a bomb

01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:05,360
available for all of your products if

01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,280
you can generate spdx reports there's a

01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:09,040
special format for sharing

01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,880
open source licensing information that's

01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:14,080
great you might have your own

01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:16,800
format you use as well educate everybody

01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,600
who touches the code not just developers

01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,400
technical writers managers etc the linux

01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,760
foundation

01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:26,159
and the open chain have great ip and

01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,480
licensing courses that you can take

01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,360
the there's other sessions here at all

01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,600
things open

01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,880
that have great licensing courses that i

01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,239
highly recommend everybody on your

01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,760
development team look at

01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:38,320
and then if you can become open chain

01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,760
conformant it is a great checklist

01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:45,040
and education process for getting

01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:48,000
your act together on an open source

01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,679
so let's talk about best practices so

01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,199
software developers do not know

01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,800
licensing they just don't

01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:54,800
it'd be great if they did you might be

01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,719
lucky and have one or two people

01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,920
but you need to you need to start from

01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,199
the very beginning and you need to

01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,000
mandate it you need to make sure it

01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:01,760
happens

01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,600
and not just when you hire them every

01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,199
year if you can

01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,360
open source policies are missing and

01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:09,760
neglected and impossible to find

01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,400
you want to fix that legal could be

01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,280
scared

01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:15,679
they might be great with contract law hr

01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,000
law employment law but just are not open

01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:18,480
source

01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,239
experts there is a great list of open

01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,560
source

01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:24,080
lawyers around the world that can help

01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,840
you with this

01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,920
and the cost of fix goes up with every

01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,199
layer built on a mistake so fix things

01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,880
as soon as they can

01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:32,320
and you are going to find these problems

01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,280
at sales time you're going to get a call

01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,800
on friday

01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,320
at the end of the quarter when your

01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,840
sales team says we would have made this

01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,760
million dollar deal but we don't have a

01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,199
bill of materials or they found a gpl

01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,960
problem or they found a vulnerability

01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:45,360
and engineering can't fix it

01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,600
they those destroy road maps and deals

01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:50,480
so you want to control your destiny

01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,600
so get ahead of it and don't let sales

01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:55,120
or customer

01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:56,000
issues impact your plans and there is no

01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,360
excuse there's great

01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,719
free training out there here is a great

01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:02,560
url for basics for software developers

01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:04,159
it can take an hour and everybody is

01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,719
smarter than they were yesterday by

01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:09,120
taking that training

01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:11,360
um three ways that typically you're

01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:14,800
going to see remediation happen

01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,600
rewind replace or resolve so rewind

01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,280
means we re

01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,000
we removed a feature we got rid of the

01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:21,440
code goodbye ip problem but also goodbye

01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,800
feature

01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:25,280
that can be a pain that kills your

01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,679
roadmap you could replace it so either

01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:29,600
you clean room the code or you swap it

01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:31,600
out for a work-a-like library

01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,880
that resolves an ip issue or a

01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,760
vulnerability

01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,400
that takes time but it's possible or you

01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,239
resolve

01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,600
sometimes you can pay money to fix the

01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:42,480
issue you can you

01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,440
can request new licensing and some rare

01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,639
rare cases

01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,520
usually that does not work maybe find

01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:49,280
some commercial

01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,199
commercial code that you can you can

01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,400
swap in but those are typically the

01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,639
three ways

01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:56,080
to fix an issue all of them take time

01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:59,360
and all of them

01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:00,480
have their own costs you'll sometimes

01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,600
hear people talk about oh we're going to

01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,840
make a shim layer

01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,440
we're going to fix our gpl problem by

01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:08,400
putting in a shim layer

01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,639
that is usually a a really serious case

01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:12,400
and you need to have your legal staff

01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,840
sitting there and really understanding

01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,600
what you're trying to do

01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,880
usually that's a way of spending more

01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:19,199
money

01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,880
building a shim spent costs more time

01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,719
more money and leaves you with a very

01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,880
similar problem in the end so

01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:28,320
here be dragons you really need to

01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,920
understand if you're trying to do that

01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,520
so you want to if you're building a

01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,840
product if you're building a company you

01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,440
very often want to get

01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,760
bought or maybe you're buying companies

01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,360
so

01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,440
open source often comes up in the

01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:41,040
context of mergers and acquisitions

01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:42,719
if you're buying a company you want to

01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,480
make sure you're buying

01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:45,920
something that you own the rights to

01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,280
after you spend a lot of money spent

01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,040
millions of dollars

01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,639
maybe billions of dollars you don't want

01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,920
to be burned if you're selling your

01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,800
company you want to sell it for the most

01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,400
amount of money

01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,040
and you don't want to have to fix things

01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:58,480
or have them hold back a bunch of money

01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,840
for risk

01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,760
so you should be prepared if you're

01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,000
selling a company to be able to provide

01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,920
your

01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,440
open source bill of materials your

01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:08,239
disclosures

01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:10,000
um the sell side may need to provide the

01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:11,760
source code to the whole application

01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,040
to an independent third party there's

01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,719
some great companies that are out there

01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,320
that will do this for money

01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,400
they'll do these reviews and build the

01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,040
build of materials the buy side is going

01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,719
to look at

01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,000
this list that comes out they won't have

01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,960
access to the source code but they'll

01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,360
have an access

01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,480
to the disclosures and list of open

01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,000
source and they can come back and say

01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,960
you got to fix this and that and this

01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,960
and that

01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,400
and they may hold back money or they may

01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,560
walk away from the deal and i've seen

01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,920
i've seen both cases

01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,159
and typically you've only got about two

01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,600
weeks between

01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:41,760
being asked to do this and getting your

01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,440
first report and maybe a few more weeks

01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,639
for fixing the problems if you're the

01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,080
you're the sell side

01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,400
so do be prepared for that and again

01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:51,600
another great reason to get things

01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:53,120
clean before you even get there

01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,199
if you're releasing something under an

01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:57,120
open source license

01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,719
everything's going to be visible you're

01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,480
going to want to make sure that you've

01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,280
probably removed all the commercial code

01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,840
you're going to look at all the

01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:05,280
multimedia images and fonts and sounds

01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,960
make sure your permission to do that

01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,800
permission to use them that's true for

01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,080
commercial code as well

01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,000
make sure that your licenses are

01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,280
compatible and in compliance

01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,120
and this may be a case where you need to

01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,320
do a very deep dive there's a question

01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,400
in the previous session about source

01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,920
code snippets if you're releasing

01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:21,360
something on an open source license all

01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,639
your code is going to be visible

01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,480
you want to make sure that you're giving

01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,679
the right credit to the code

01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,520
you want to generate your license

01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:29,600
notices and you may

01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,360
want to look and decide on a contributor

01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,360
licensing agreement for any code

01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,639
that comes back in a developer

01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,560
certificate of origin

01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,679
and or a code of conduct these are all

01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,719
super important if you're going to be

01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:41,840
making an open source

01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,840
project yourself

01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,199
open source scanning so these are

01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,239
companies and products and open source

01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:50,480
projects that

01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:52,000
scan through your code and helps you

01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,000
figure out what you're using

01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,520
and you may be using hundreds or

01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,360
thousands of components

01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,880
that's way outside the ability of humans

01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:02,400
to to deal with

01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,600
there's a great number in in sociology

01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,520
called dunbar's number

01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,679
which maybe means that the human brain

01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:10,800
can maybe keep track of like 150

01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:11,520
relationships we now have 500 or 5 000

01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,639
components

01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:16,000
way way too many to manage just by a

01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:19,280
human

01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,040
so software composition analysis sca

01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,199
this is the scanning tools that are used

01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,080
to manage it allows you to automate the

01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:26,320
discovery

01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,840
allows you to set license policies

01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:30,320
vulnerability policies

01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,280
generate your bomb reports and also can

01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,320
alert if there's

01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:35,280
either ip problems or license policy

01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:38,639
problems

01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:39,760
great tools to run they have some set up

01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,520
time and costs

01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,800
even if you're using a free tool but

01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:46,000
they're they're great

01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,840
to to start using on the left hand side

01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,520
i have a list of free tools that are

01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,000
either software composition analysis

01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,560
tools

01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,840
or systems that are associated with that

01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:58,080
great ways to get started

01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,159
owasp makes dependency check there's

01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:02,000
also scan code that are out there

01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:04,080
these are great tools to kind of find

01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,440
out both for your license some of your

01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:07,440
licensing issues and your

01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:12,639
vulnerabilities on the right hand side

01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:16,320
is commercial code

01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:17,040
sca systems many many that are out there

01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,320
now

01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:22,080
great ways to get support as well

01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,920
not just not just a tool kit but

01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:26,400
training and support

01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,600
and i highly recommend that you run you

01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:29,199
run at least one of these

01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,199
you may find yourself running multiple

01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:34,719
ones of these to make sure your code is

01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:37,520
gets clean and stay clean so how does

01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:38,960
how does sca find third-party code well

01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,560
it's going to do things such as look at

01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,960
your repository artifacts

01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,000
like your maven files your mpm files

01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,960
things like that

01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,480
may look for license text itself i look

01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,239
for the word general public license

01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:52,639
might look for copyright statements

01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:55,280
i might look for stolen files i might

01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:56,719
look for a cutting cut and pasted code

01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:59,199
these are all things that require a

01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,560
human to to manage the things at the top

01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:02,159
are a little easier for a human to

01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,040
manage usually it's a thumbs up or a

01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:05,600
thumbs down

01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:07,040
because they're big pieces big rocks the

01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,960
things at the bottom like

01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,280
stolen source code or cut and pasted

01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,679
source code can be difficult to manage

01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,520
and

01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:15,199
really requires an expert eye that might

01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:19,520
be a case where you have

01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:22,560
outside staff help you snippets

01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,520
are tough they are becoming more and

01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,840
more important

01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,960
as time goes on fingerprinting snippets

01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,719
is where you want to see did your

01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,719
developers take code

01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:32,159
from some other open source project and

01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,120
insert it right in the middle of yours

01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:34,960
without

01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:37,120
preserving the license text this cut

01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,120
pasted code sometimes it's involved with

01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,040
license laundering somebody took some

01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,800
code under the gpl license and brought

01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,000
it in under a different license

01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,080
you want to be able to find that and

01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,679
manage that especially

01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:49,199
if you are going to be acquired by

01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,639
certain large companies or if you're

01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,920
going to be releasing this code as open

01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,760
source

01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,360
they can be difficult to understand it's

01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,280
a lot of work there's

01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,639
concerns around false positives though

01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,320
frankly i think

01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:01,760
when people say false positive sometimes

01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,480
there's an excuse not to do the real

01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,239
analysis

01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,800
you find a lot of problems you want to

01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:08,320
deal with it so

01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,600
not everybody's ready to start there but

01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,960
i do think you should be paying

01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,679
attention to this especially in certain

01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,679
fields of use

01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:17,600
you are probably going to be running sas

01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,280
or das tools on your code

01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,520
this is ways of finding new

01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:24,080
vulnerabilities it's something above and

01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,320
beyond software composition analysis so

01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,679
it

01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:28,960
finds new bugs not just known bugs

01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:30,080
and usually you're going to find that

01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,800
you're going to be running these tools

01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,840
on your

01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,800
proprietary code not on the open source

01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:38,719
side because it's sometimes too

01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:40,639
difficult to do uh one of the last

01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,719
things we'll we'll talk about here is

01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:44,560
open chain this is a slide from the open

01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,800
chain project i highly recommend

01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:48,080
anybody building software whether it's

01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,239
open source

01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:52,719
projects or commercial software that

01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:54,960
they become open chain conformant

01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,840
it is now an iso standard it's pretty

01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,239
straightforward

01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:00,080
to get involved with they have a great

01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:01,199
list of education and checklists and

01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:04,080
processes

01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:05,679
and you can self-certify you you follow

01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,520
the checklist and you can basically say

01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,520
yes we are open chain conformant

01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:11,360
or you can bring in a third party to

01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:13,280
make sure that you're conformant

01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:15,120
go to the open chain project great set

01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,360
of experts there as well there's a few

01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:20,639
monthly meetings that you can join

01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:22,719
great documentation great great um

01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:24,800
code that is available in tools as well

01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:27,360
highly highly recommending

01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:29,120
everybody because it's me yes excuse me

01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,639
jeff just giving you a heads up there

01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:32,000
you have five minutes left

01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:33,360
thanks so much okay we're getting toward

01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,960
the end here and we'll leave a little

01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,080
bit of time for questions here at the

01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,239
end

01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:39,520
here is a set of best practices this

01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:42,400
will be available

01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,960
as a checklist in the slides afterward

01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,760
basically

01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:47,360
reviewing what i've talked about today

01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:50,159
and they are all great places

01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:52,320
to improve the quality of your your

01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:54,080
product and your company

01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,440
they all don't have to be done at once

01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,800
but you should

01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,800
pick some of the things especially

01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:01,840
software composition analysis on top

01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,840
to start getting your household

01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,440
a couple things i learned along the way

01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,440
compliance and open source

01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,560
is still very personality driven you're

01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,080
going to find that you might have one or

01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,719
two experts who care about this in a

01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,159
company

01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:13,920
it might be you if you're the person on

01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:15,920
the call today here uh

01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,960
when influencers leave a company's

01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,600
compliance program

01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,800
often falls apart you want to try

01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,080
through things like open chain and

01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:26,560
whatnot to make it

01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:27,679
more part of the soul of your company

01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,679
you're going to find that experience

01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:31,040
levels fail very greatly

01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:34,080
some companies are great at this some

01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:35,360
are bad at this remediation is difficult

01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,840
and is more of an art

01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:40,000
than a science and you learn by doing it

01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:42,480
along the way

01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,639
and what is what's difficult well new

01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:46,560
code is valued over maintenance so

01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:49,120
nobody wants to go back in time and fix

01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,199
things especially for compliance

01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:53,520
outside of m a work you're going to have

01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:55,120
to fight that struggle

01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,880
inner package licensing is still

01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:58,159
difficult what happens underneath the

01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,280
libraries that you bring in from the

01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:01,040
outside

01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,560
most people only know one percent of

01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,600
what they're actually using that's a

01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,199
problem

01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,760
and each layer is managed by different

01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:09,679
teams and they might be

01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,280
difficult to work with and there are

01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:12,239
some things that people just never ever

01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:15,679
want to deal with

01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:16,719
like old code so we'll talk about what's

01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:20,000
on the horizon

01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:21,760
um you need to use a tool you need to be

01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,800
concerned about supply chain attacks i

01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,639
think this is something that we're going

01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,920
to see over the next few years here how

01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,000
companies are going to be attacked by

01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:31,199
people attacking their supply chain

01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:33,520
libraries and tools get get the bill of

01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:35,040
materials as part of your contracts

01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,719
um you're going to probably want to

01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,760
start working with internal audit

01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:38,800
because they're going to come to you at

01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,320
a certain point and say we need to

01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:43,360
manage open source

01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:46,080
and if you're dealing with databases

01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:47,199
there's a lot of new licenses or quasi

01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,120
fast licenses

01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,480
that are going to affect how you use

01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:52,400
your databases

01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:54,800
pay for so we got a couple minutes here

01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,040
for q a i saw out of the corner of my

01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,600
eye

01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:59,280
a million questions here let's see if we

01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:03,840
can um

01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:03,840
work through as many of these we can so

01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,520
let's take a look any guidance on how to

01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,600
handle the point

01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,280
if a supplier doesn't want to answer the

01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,360
questions regarding open source in the

01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:16,639
commercial delivered

01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:19,440
software so siegfried you have a lot of

01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:21,520
pressure if if the supplier

01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,719
is not answering these questions you're

01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,800
probably paying them

01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:26,239
so when the contract comes up for for

01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,840
review

01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:29,679
start making noise about looking at

01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:32,320
other suppliers

01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:34,639
start i've seen companies sometimes find

01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:36,320
one or two or three serious problems

01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:38,400
to start the questions start the

01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,520
conversation hey we found a gpl problem

01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,920
hey we found

01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,360
um heartbleed in your code that you gave

01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,800
us and you haven't updated it

01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,080
sometimes finding one of the two or

01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,440
three of those issues especially if

01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,000
you're bringing the other side's legal

01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:51,280
team

01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,199
in can help open that damn um usually

01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:54,719
it's not because they're don't want to

01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:55,760
help you it's that they're scared

01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,400
they're worried that they're going to

01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:00,400
find a bunch of problems and

01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:03,120
it's a conversation and we all need to

01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:04,880
get better and so

01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,000
work with your suppliers try to see what

01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,719
you can do and if you need to you need

01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,560
to walk away

01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:12,560
find another supplier okay um

01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,159
will the great slide will the slides be

01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:17,520
shared yes they will be

01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:19,280
shared and um scanning questions

01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:23,040
is scanning mean both snippets and or

01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:26,639
dependencies scanning can be

01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:28,960
snippets can be dependencies can be

01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:30,960
multimedia images icons it depends on

01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:33,199
the tool that you select

01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:35,120
and different tools will have different

01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:36,400
types of things that they can discover

01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,400
there was a great paper that was

01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,600
released today talking about comparisons

01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:42,960
of scanning tools

01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:46,719
that um if you if you look uh for

01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:48,960
sca scanning tools paper released today

01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,639
you'll see some good information there

01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,000
let's see projects with hundreds or

01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,199
thousands of dependently

01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,600
dependencies inevitably have

01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:56,639
dependencies with incompatible licenses

01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,760
what is your best practice

01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:01,440
recommendation for consumers of

01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:02,880
third-party source code to handle this

01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,800
this is tough and i think this is why

01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,920
sometimes there is paralysis

01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:10,159
around licensing and answering these

01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,840
questions

01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:13,280
because you're going to find problems

01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,360
people sometimes don't want to look for

01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:17,360
it if you can this might be a place

01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:19,040
where you start doing open source

01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,719
contributions yourself

01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,239
if you find this problem and it matters

01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:24,000
to your company this might be a case

01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:24,880
where you have your own developers start

01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,520
to fix

01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:29,280
and remediate those issues maybe you log

01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:30,080
them as defects if you can't fix them

01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,360
yourself

01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:35,280
this might be a case where you need to

01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:35,280
start moving away um

01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,639
it is tough and i think we it took us 30

01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:41,040
years

01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:42,320
to get to this point of this kind of

01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:44,400
mess of

01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,840
combinations of com libraries and

01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:47,920
components and licenses is probably

01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,360
going to take us years to dig out of it

01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,960
but we need to start doing the work to

01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,560
dig out of it if you can start with

01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,840
smaller projects that's great

01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,800
but sometimes you find that you just

01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,159
gotta make us think and to say this is a

01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,560
problem we shouldn't be making new

01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:01,119
features if we have a big gpl violation

01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,480
or

01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:07,119
or xyz and you do see that companies do

01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:08,480
you know do slowly slowly start to get

01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:10,159
their acts together

01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,679
and this may be a case again a little

01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:13,679
financial help little legal help et

01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:16,880
cetera

01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:18,880
so tools to track software acquisition

01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,960
if i can go back in time here a little

01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:24,000
bit

01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:26,239
there is a slide that has a list of some

01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,520
tools i missed a couple just because

01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:30,880
it's a very

01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:32,080
fast moving space but these are tools

01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,159
that are great for scanning

01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:35,600
some just scan for licensed text others

01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:36,480
actually scan for the dependencies

01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,760
themselves

01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:42,480
others are backed by um

01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,600
actual databases of snippets so like uh

01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,840
palomita

01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,199
which i started back in 2004 now owned

01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,920
by a company called revenara

01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:50,239
they can do snippet analysis i believe

01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,639
uh

01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:54,480
foss id and maybe synopsis may be able

01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:57,600
to do snippet analysis

01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:59,520
great question to ask um your vendor

01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,719
and you may start with things that are

01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,400
just doing package level

01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:04,000
analysis and then eventually move to

01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:07,280
snipping level analysis as

01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:10,800
as your ability to deal gets

01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:12,880
gets better uh let's see um

01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,320
any other questions i believe we have

01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,920
hit all the questions there and we're

01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,880
kind of hitting toward the end of time

01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,880
here

01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:21,840
anything i missed or any last questions

01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,840
that people have

01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,719
okay if you have any after the session

01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,639
