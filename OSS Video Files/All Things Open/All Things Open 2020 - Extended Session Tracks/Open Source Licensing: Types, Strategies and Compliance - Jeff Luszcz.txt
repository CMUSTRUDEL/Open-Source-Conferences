Abstract: Open Source powers the world, but you need to do more than use it. 

In this talk we will provide background on the most common types of open source licenses, business models, security issues and the processes required to help you remain secure and in compliance. We will discuss best practices, scanning tools, remediation, customer and partner expectations around OSS compliance and how to manage OSS during events such as a product release or M&A.
