Abstract: Terraform is an amazing open-source toolset for automating infrastructure in the public and private cloud. This course will teach you the fundamentals of Terraform to deploy infrastructure in a consistent, repeatable manner across multiple services.

Systems Administrators and DevOps Engineers have always been charged to do more with less. Defining infrastructure in code and automating its deployment helps improve operational efficiency and lower administrative overhead. In this session, you'll learn foundational knowledge of Hashicorp's Terraform software, a toolset for infrastructure automation. First, you'll discover how open source tools, such as Terraform can be leveraged to implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Finally, you'll learn how to automate your infrastructure deployments in the AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud with Terraform.
