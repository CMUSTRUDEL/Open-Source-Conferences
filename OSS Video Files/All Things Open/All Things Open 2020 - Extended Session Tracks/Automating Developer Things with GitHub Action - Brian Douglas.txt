thank you very much all right so this

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,320
will be challenging so

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,280
uh basically i'm just gonna continue to

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,400
post in the

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,040
workshop uh repo uh mainly because i

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,480
want to

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
make sure everybody has access to the

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,000
the content um

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,279
that is a link to a repo where you can

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
just self-paced

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,560
um and

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,240
david bates can you link it where's the

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,840
link um

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,760
just dropped a link again to all

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,440
panelists

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,280
if you don't see that it'll there'll be

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,160
a slide too as well where you can just

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,239
type in the

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,760
repo itself um but the hope is that you

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,040
could also do the self-paced

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,960
um not seeing the link can you change

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,440
oh because i'm sending it to panelists

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,320
got it okay panelists and attendees

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,079
all right excellent so now you see a

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,440
link

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,199
wow all right we're gonna get here we're

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,719
gonna we're gonna make it through all

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,680
right so

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,160
that link is so you can do the

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,840
self-paced uh content

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,760
uh what this is gonna be a mix of me

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,040
doing some slides as well as going

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,760
through the self-paced content and

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
encouraging

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,720
you to do it um i think we are we got

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,720
roughly i guess 40 minutes

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,880
left are 35 minutes left which will be

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,479
fine because like i said

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,000
um and i think uh someone raised their

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,200
hand but i'm not sure what that means

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
to be quite honest all right so this is

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,840
going to be around

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,040
automating your your developer workflow

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,400
uh it's going to be through a tool

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
called github actions

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
i'm just going to make assumptions i

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,240
usually have some jokes about if you

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,840
ever heard of github but i'm going to

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,159
make assumptions that you have

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,119
at this point if you haven't you can

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,479
open up a tab

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,320
and check that out as mentioned before

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,520
the slides are here that's the link i

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,720
just dropped in

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,360
um there also if you go into the readme

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,280
of that that same repo this the link to

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,840
the slides are also

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,520
there as well you should be able to read

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,320
the slides if you can't actually see the

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,079
slides

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,759
um what i can do is actually make them

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,079
viewable for everybody but i'm gonna go

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,799
on a limb and think that the slides are

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,840
viewable

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,280
but feel free to yep slides are

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,879
available i'm just checking it

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
all right so without further ado i'm

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,560
just going to jump into as well

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,720
so i work in this company called github

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,200
github's a place for collaboration

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,480
um through the internet um it's really

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,200
started with version control

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,599
uh using this tool called get open

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,360
sourced um

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,360
yeah it's it's open source version

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
control um system

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,400
and uh built by the creator of linux as

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,319
well so

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,000
just a lot of a lot of bullet points

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,760
there but that's github

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,440
again if you haven't heard of it just go

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,440
to github.com check it out

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,879
um but what i want to talk about real

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,000
quick is that github's been shipping a

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,280
lot of features

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,879
um and if you haven't been

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,560
using get up for a long time maybe

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,640
you're a brand new programmer

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,800
actually let's just do something if you

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,280
um just put how many

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
months uh you'll do months uh that

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,840
you've been

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,200
programming um just drop that in the

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,920
chat so

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,239
good 12 months 60 months cool yeah so

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
yeah

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,440
do the calculation so how many years

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,440
times and months

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,720
um 20 years uh

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,840
the question was months just kidding um

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,120
but yeah you get the idea uh cool i love

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,000
the interaction too as well i love that

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,760
y'all there's like

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
right at the ready the chat all right so

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,440
ghettos for shipping a lot of features

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,640
um and i can't talk about features

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,319
without talking about beyonce because

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,360
beyonce i'm a beyonce advocate as well

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,840
which i'll get into

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,959
uh that's what i do at github uh beyonce

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,319
had a feature where that she shipped

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,080
with mega the stallion

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,680
uh over the summer it kind of blew up on

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,360
tick-tock the song was already big on

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,519
tick-tock and then she came through

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,879
with an awesome version that featured

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,560
beyonce so

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,080
queen bee i like to make the joke that

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,840
i'm queen bee at github

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,280
github has 50 million developers

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,080
worldwide that it used uh

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,319
the actual product um beyonce has a lot

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,319
of

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,760
people worldwide actually listen to her

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,599
uh what i love about this is that i can

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,720
talk about beyonce when i was in china a

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,040
couple years ago

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,680
um beyonce had literally just three

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,959
months prior actually played in china

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,599
in shanghai so she's a world-renowned

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,040
superstar

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,560
and i'm just trying to get to her level

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,480
stepped away for a second came back to

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
beyonce excellent

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,400
slides they're linked they'll be linked

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
again soon but i mentioned i'm a beyonce

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,959
advocate i'm really

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,680
a uh i'm really a

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,520
developer advocate and um i'm focused on

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
engagement in the open source community

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,639
uh basically what that means is talk to

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,120
everybody who doesn't pay us money

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,800
uh for the most part some foundation

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,199
open source foundations do pay money

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
but um what i'm getting at is that i'm

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,800
focused on that but also i'm focused on

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,639
this other tool called github actions

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
uh and what i like to do is i go to bat

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,840
for the hive as well

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
so a couple years ago about two and a

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,960
half years ago

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,000
uh github launched this feature well two

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,360
years and three months

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
they watched this feature called github

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,440
actions and really this tool is really

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,680
to

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,520
give you the tools to do what you need

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,479
to get done at github and then github

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,840
gets out of the way

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,680
so we have uh the github api github

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,120
api's been around for

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,280
at this point so what 2012

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
000. yeah so 12 years 12 and a half

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,080
years github's been around

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,120
the api has been around for 12 and a

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,360
half years so it's something that

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,960
i think that github's done a good job on

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,080
the documentation continues to improve

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,759
too as well so if you haven't checked

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,160
out the latest version of the docs uh

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,680
definitely check out docsetgithub.com

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,039
but it has a really good reference of

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,440
all the stuff you have available to you

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,160
in

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,759
the api itself um so what i'm getting at

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,960
is github has all these things that we

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,000
call primitives

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,759
uh primitives being the api the web

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,919
hooks authentication through jwts now

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,919
um all these different pieces so you can

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,120
integrate with github and build tools on

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,720
top of github so

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
if you've ever heard of like so

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
digitalocean just launched a new uh

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,319
platform to be able to

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,840
ship sites uh using their their new ui

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,319
you can also connect the github account

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,919
to that um

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
company won't let me download the slides

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,000
from the link okay

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,520
um the slides are really not important

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,639
what's really important is the uh

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,479
the repo itself but um

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,840
what i'll do is i can i can put i can

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,600
host a um

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,199
a uh a pdf version as well um

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,280
which honestly the vpn will probably

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,319
block a pdf2 as well so

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,080
um take lots of screenshots i suppose

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,680
all right um so actually what i'll do is

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,280
also i'll tweet out the slides as well

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,759
so if you want to then check the slides

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,360
out from your um

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,880
not from the vpn maybe from your phone

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,440
you can also get access that way so i'll

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,800
do that

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560
uh my twitter handle is on the bottom

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,479
right hand corner so just look for

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
a tweet of me pointing to you the slides

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,160
after as well

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,360
all right so what the focus on this is

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,800
content it's about improving your

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,720
experience with github

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,639
uh and the way i talk about this is

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,520
actually automating workflows workflows

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,720
being developer workflows

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,160
um excellent cool

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,479
yeah i will be looking at the chat the

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,120
entire time so this is this is your time

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,759
uh the slides are available the repos

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
available

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,120
so you could technically just take the

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,400
links and then i guess

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,400
go on your own pace and do whatever you

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,160
want but uh if you do have questions

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,680
feel free to slow me down i know the

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,120
chat is pretty vibrant at the moment

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,000
every time i ask a question

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,800
you answer it too as well but all right

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,880
focus

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
automate workflows using the github api

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,160
that's what

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,199
we did with github apps github apps or

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,680
things like

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,360
so netlify has a github app uh travis

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,240
has a github app circle has a github app

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
heroku has a good

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,000
app these are like package solutions

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,080
that people can build

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,160
and integrate on top of github now these

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,120
were they're not massive they're just

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,639
like a lot it's a

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,960
it's a more of a lift if you want to

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,680
integrate with github and we realized

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,599
this

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,240
where our focus was actually integrating

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,400
flexibility uh for integrators to build

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,440
on top of our api and our platform

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,680
um and this is all around the whole idea

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,800
of like identifying repeated tasks

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,039
so for me i know i do

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,319
every time i open up actually open up my

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,599
computer monday

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,879
today and i know i want to

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,639
i want to go and check and see

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,000
what my my teammates are working on

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,440
because i do have one teammate that this

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,919
that started her day

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,520
on sunday because she's in australia uh

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,919
but we do this thing where we open up an

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,000
issue

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,280
and that's our stand up so in our issue

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,879
we just say

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,400
exactly what we're gonna do for the week

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,199
and then at the end of the day we close

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
that issue

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,199
but because every week there's like a

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,080
monday every week um i'm not sure if

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,200
there's like two things that are

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,719
guaranteeing live mondays and uh

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
up until recently taxes but we don't

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,479
have to get into that but what i'm

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,680
what i am focusing on is that i know i'm

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,279
gonna have to wake up monday

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,959
and tell the rest of the team what i'm

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,160
gonna do and the reason i do this is

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,959
because we're all remote

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,360
um we're really focused on asynchronous

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,760
uh communication and not actually being

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,760
directly on a zoom call every time we

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,399
want to do like a stand up or sync

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,279
so that's why i built a github action to

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,440
open up an issue

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,399
every monday or technically sunday for

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,279
me but monday for australians

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,880
to assign everybody on the team to the

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,000
issue and then ask them what they're

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,519
working on this week

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,800
and we call it the top five so we just

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,760
write down five things we plan on

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
working on

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,519
uh whether it's code related whether

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,040
it's like write this email or write this

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,640
blog post or whatever it is

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,680
uh we just put that in the list so that

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,800
way everybody has an idea of what

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,320
everybody's working on and there's

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,160
opportunity for collaboration

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
you can just read through that on monday

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,360
uh or monday afternoon

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
and then go and help out other folks or

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,760
if you don't need help then you just

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,120
continue working

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,040
on stuff but at least everybody has an

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,399
idea what's going on um

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,000
but i automated that and i wanted to

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,760
bring up this really quick uh about

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,959
github apps is that probot

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,680
it's a we we realized a couple years ago

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,360
that

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,040
github apps were complicated to actually

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,640
get started so we built this thing

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,959
called probot i say we

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,880
a couple github employees built this uh

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,480
to make it easier to

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,560
uh make it easy like make these

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,440
integrations off the bat so if you ever

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,600
use react

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
uh they have this create react app um

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
there's also other tools that have

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,959
command line tools that are very similar

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,320
but they have create robot app where you

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,279
can create a pro bot

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,640
app which is a github app integration um

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,079
this isn't about pro bot i just wanted

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,360
to mention it because pro bot actually

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,240
is built on top of this thing called

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,120
octa-kit

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,399
and octokid is an sdk uh to integrate

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,839
with the github api

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,079
uh this sdk is ideal um

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,920
mainly because i i love it because my

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,720
previous employer that i worked at

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,440
i used to write up like all these um api

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,680
docs

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,279
and all these api integrations uh for

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,720
all these different tools like twitter

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,079
and facebook and github uh and once i

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,320
found out that sdks

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,600
existed like my world changed because i

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,880
didn't have to continue to write these

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,640
things by from scratch

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,240
so what i'm getting at is octokid exists

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,519
so that way you can integrate the api

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,560
easier

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,839
um but what i want to really mention

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,680
about probio what really

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,600
kind of wins for probot and making it

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,800
easier is that it all it does is listen

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
to web hooks

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,160
it takes a an event on github

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,600
and then it triggers that with the api

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
um and that's sort of like the bare

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,880
bones like the primitive of interacting

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,399
and making automation

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,920
and i promise you we will get to some

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,800
hands-on things and looking at stuff but

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,800
i need to

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,640
set the stage we definitely had a lot of

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,680
no's uh coming up

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,120
uh on people who use get actions um

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,160
and now honestly the question should

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,839
have been how many people have built

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,600
something with the github api

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,320
and the majority of you probably would

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,240
say no and that's a common occurrence

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
it's like if you don't there's no need

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,279
to build something an api like you

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,399
continue you could if you had to open up

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,959
issue every monday

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,320
like it might take you know 10 minutes

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,839
to write up that issue and open it up

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,200
but you could still do it without

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,079
integrating directly into github's

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,079
platform so this slide right here

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,120
it is the list of all the workflows that

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,440
are available to you

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,959
uh through actions so i can run an

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,600
action on deletion

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,320
of issues deletions of code i can run

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,360
actions

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,360
based on anything that's um changed uh

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,040
if their people request has been opened

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
um there's a lot of opportunity to

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,920
actually run

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,519
actions on different events so just know

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,920
that these events exist

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,680
if you just search in the docs events

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,720
that trigger workflows

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,320
you'll find the whole list there as well

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,880
as a beginner developer i need a

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:22,160
community who can guide me so anyone

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:24,000
like to mentor honestly i would say

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,200
there is a discord in that url

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,800
opensource.pizza

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,959
uh you're welcome to join that's my

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,600
discord um you're welcome to join that

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,079
and ask

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,639
for ask as many questions as you like um

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,200
do actions work the same on github

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,399
enterprise

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,360
instance uh yes well for the most part

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,880
so

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,480
and so

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,639
that's a good question and the answer is

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,839
yes it does work the same so we

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,800
recently got github actions to work on

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,560
enterprise um

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
for self-hosted versions like if you're

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,360
doing some special stuff you'll have to

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,639
consult the documentation

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,639
on the differences in what you need to

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,920
get done um i

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,360
i'm sort of like reaching right now

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,760
because i haven't actually ran actions

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,040
on a hosted version of github enterprise

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,800
other than github

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,240
so ironically github uses github

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,440
enterprise to build github

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,399
so i nothing for me to make actions work

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,959
is different

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,600
now your company similar to the person

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,800
who couldn't

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,720
download slides like you could have a

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,200
vpn or a firewall or

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,279
different layers of extraction but

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
like that's between you and your it

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,399
admin or whoever runs devops

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,800
or whoever runs the show at your company

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,839
but for github uh github itself is um

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,639
yeah it works um gollum that's a good

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,160
question

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,440
uh and i honestly um it looks like i

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,000
just lost my uh

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,000
chat hold on real quick um

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,519
api gold i um i was looking at that

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,399
earlier today as well i had actually not

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,959
seen

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,639
um oh you know what it is it's it's the

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,519
wiki

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,320
so golem is actually what powers the um

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,760
the wiki

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,480
um the wiki feature on github um so you

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,160
go

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,519
are there apis for gitlab um yes

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,959
i know that because i used to work at a

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,800
company that used that leverage to

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,959
integrate it with get lab and i used to

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,760
use gitlab and bitbucket so gitlab and

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,880
bucket both have apis that i i highly

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,279
recommend you check out

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,800
gitlab also has a um they do have a ci

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,639
they do have something very similar to

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,560
actions i don't know what it's called

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,519
but yeah worth checking out but reminder

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,600
i do work at github so like i

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,800
i probably can answer github questions

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,920
better than get lab questions to be

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,680
quite honest

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,959
all right so what i want to

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,120
mentioned to as well as integrating with

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,160
ci and cd and run through

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,839
gitlab runners excellent um

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,240
talk about integrating ci cd with

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,440
github's api containers integration is

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,880
something that you should probably

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,480
be doing and to be aware of um it's

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,600
there is a enough uh

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,560
ato disjoint um

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,320
i run the um so this is quote from

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,440
beyonce i mentioned beyonce as well if

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,079
everything was perfect and also

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,880
apologies

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,839
uh uh kids are um waking up at the

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,320
moment so

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,680
sounds like uh it's a little loud uh if

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,480
everything was perfect you'd never need

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,639
to learn and grow

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
and uh that was a quote from beyonce in

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,680
an interview she did

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,199
years ago i think uh possibly with oprah

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,959
uh i probably shouldn't have that quote

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,240
attributed better but uh what i'm

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,000
getting at is

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,440
there as i mentioned with the opening

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,720
issue every every week

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,959
like there are opportunities for you to

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,399
automate those things and which i'm

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,600
getting into is like

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,279
i don't want to i don't want to spend

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,800
all my time reviewing pr's or spending

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,079
all my time opening issues and closing

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,079
issues and triaging

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,199
if i can automate portions of that like

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,880
i'm going to aim for that

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,920
and i'm happy to talk about stories of

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,519
my experience of hacktoberfest as well

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,759
um no worries um

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,519
and how i sort of manage automations

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,440
through hacktoberfest prs

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,000
for my on my own um part of that is

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,480
so a couple years ago um shortly before

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
github

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,079
launched actions uh we went to this

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,320
whole big overhaul

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,000
of taking out all the jquery out of the

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,040
front end site or the front end portion

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,160
of the site

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,079
and uh this is specifically github.com

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,360
and we'd discover in this this blog post

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,240
will go into more details

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,920
but we had discovered that jquery for

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,440
the most part like javascript and jquery

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,079
like you did most of what you want to do

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,759
in javascript with modern-day javascript

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,040
uh and the dom

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,120
so we actually created the automation

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,639
or a check to basically check if there

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,880
was any jquery and prs

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,639
so every time someone opened up a pr it

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,639
would say hey you have jquery here

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,079
we're moving away from jquery let's

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,160
focus on

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,839
like writing it in javascript and what

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,000
was cool about that is they actually had

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,839
a code snippet so if you had jquery it

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,199
actually converted it into javascript

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
and you can literally just copy and

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,759
paste the entire part of

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,880
that javascript and replace that jquery

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,199
and it would work

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,480
um so in the course of like a couple

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,880
like a handful of months

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
they were able to eradicate all jquery

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,720
from from the site

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,000
which is like this is not like a a knock

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,679
against jquery it just happened to be a

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,160
decision that engineering was moving

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,919
towards but they were able to sort of

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,959
let the automation

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,559
run the show when encouraging folks to

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,559
if you open a pr it doesn't matter if

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,080
you didn't touch jquery directly

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,520
but it'd be a nice opportunity for you

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,720
to also change that file at the same

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,600
time

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,799
so the best part about cis is that when

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,559
they work they work

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,000
um and like you should not have to like

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,120
continue to think about them if they're

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,039
up and running so

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,799
keep that in mind uh so i want to talk

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,039
about github actions which is

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,559
it's as similar to github apps but

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,160
instead of github apps

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,160
being something that you install on your

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,600
repo which i didn't mention you also

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,400
with github actions it's already

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,960
available to you

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,400
in all of your repos today so it gives

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,720
you ability to run arbitrary code

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,360
snippets inside of your your code

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,640
through the power of gamble and vms and

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,520
a bunch of other stuff that i don't have

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,440
to go into

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,559
in great detail but just know that it's

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,480
a really powerful tool and it's

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,480
available to you today

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,080
so going like the workflow automation

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,520
piece too as well and

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,400
i want to talk about git of actions

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,440
that's that in workflow automation

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,919
aside from ci and cd um so

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,520
i mentioned identifying repeated task

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,120
now

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,799
i believe most of us i don't know how

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,600
many people outside of the us are

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,240
are watching this but i think basketball

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,160
today is like

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,919
played in like 252 countries i think

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,480
it's the number that was out there

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,840
um would have been great to phase out

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,360
query jquery

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,280
yeah um so this is a basketball court

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,600
and i'm bringing this up as an analogy

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,720
um so as i said basketball it's a global

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,799
sport at this point

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,000
um but the stick of basketball kind of

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,559
like soccer

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
or football uh except the fact that you

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,120
dribbling

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,840
use your hands instead of your feet so

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,160
hopefully i'm not gonna explain like

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,039
hopefully i don't get you to snore uh

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,360
too soon

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,880
uh but i'm a big fan of imagining every

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,240
issue with someone's first issue which

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,600
is a stan lee quote

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,360
um so if you've never heard of

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,240
basketball hopefully i can

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,360
teach you something very small but this

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,039
is a basketball that's a thing

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,120
that's orange little ball the line is

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,960
basically directly pointing to the hoop

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,640
and within basketball you have a team

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,240
five on five

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,840
and for the most part you leverage your

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,760
entire team to make sure that you can

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,880
get the ball in the opposing team's

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,080
hoop if that makes sense okay so there

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,799
was this concept

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,640
earlier in the 2000s the mid-2000s of

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,280
full court layups that happened all the

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,679
time

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,480
where folks like one person would take

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,400
the ball in

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,080
check it in and then take the ball all

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,679
the way to the hoop with that with

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,039
ignoring the rest of the team

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,200
on the court uh and this was

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,120
it's not a phenomenon it's kind of like

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,480
there's a term called cowboy coding

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,559
uh which is you you write code and

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,760
you basically do it all um i've worked

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,120
up a lot of people on different

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,440
engineering teams where

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,039
i happen to be like the one rock star on

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,799
the team sounds like allen iverson

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,880
so i actually used to have a screenshot

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,840
of albert iverson as part of this but i

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,840
condensed the talk

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,360
and removed him but yeah exactly alan

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,440
iverson so if you're familiar with the

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,960
76ers in the mid-2000s

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,960
uh he is the person i'm actually

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,039
focusing this idea on

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,159
but essentially you want to be able to

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,159
leverage your entire team

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,520
yeah you don't want to work in silos you

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,679
don't want to ball hog

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,640
but instead you want to actually play to

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,360
your strengths

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,000
so in basketball uh similar to this this

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,120
movie slash

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,440
book called moneyball where they

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,000
leverage statistics to uh

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,799
improve the game of baseball uh and

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,640
predict things

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,919
uh they took that same concept to in the

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,840
nba and

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,760
they actually discovered that there's

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,480
this one spot on the court called area

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,039
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,159
and it's 31 of your shots go in the hoop

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,880
from this point

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,600
and this is a big deal because if you

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,400
know that

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,400
every single shot taken here because

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,080
it's particularly this spot because most

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,320
nba players are right-handed

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,919
it's also the the how close you are to

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,039
the rim and the arc you could make it's

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,480
actually a very difficult

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:13,039
shot to protect or to defend against

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,559
so knowing that you over index and you

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,080
optimize your place

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,240
unless you're michael jordan notice

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,120
notorious ball hog um you should watch

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,440
the documentary

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,120
uh documentary um michael jordan he

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,120
actually spent a lot more time

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,919
passing and uh elevating other people

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,919
around this in the team as well but

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,960
um i think there are other ball hogs

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,679
actually i don't want to dro i don't

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,039
throw out names because uh um

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,960
i don't want to offend anybody if i

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,280
start naming uh your star player from

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,000
the the team you root for but

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,919
name and shame uh i'll i'll refocus my

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,200
efforts i grew up a magic fan orlando

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,440
magic i'm from florida

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,400
and uh i now live in oakland where the

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,360
warriors

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,120
um they used to win but anyway what i'm

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,960
getting at is that

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,320
if you over index and you you play to

00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
the strength so that way you take the

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,799
ball instead of

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,720
hawking the ball uh you could actually

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,080
play and then shoot from area 31

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,640
from the player who's already positioned

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,159
there so that is the goal

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,159
uh fear the beard excellent

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,520
um but yeah that's that's the idea of

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,720
automation is actually

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,480
play to the place where you know you're

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,200
gonna make the most shots and the most

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,159
wins

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,840
um so if you identify poor sorry if you

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,600
review pull requests once a day

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,720
um one of the common things people do is

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
they take their pull requests and they

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,520
go to slack

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,360
and then they paste it in there and then

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,200
mention the team like instead of doing

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,120
that why not automate the notification

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
that prs are opened inside of slack or

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,640
discord or telegram or whatever it is

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,080
like automate that portion of that and

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,960
that's what i'm getting at and this is

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
where i'm finally going to talk about

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,480
github actions i know this was a

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,440
roundabout way to get you contacts

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,640
but quite honestly like the i'll drop in

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
the repo one more time

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,919
uh that is the self-paced portion of the

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,320
workshop that you can do at your own

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,720
pace

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,080
uh whatever you would like um it doesn't

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,799
have any of this context that i

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,919
talked about um but it will get you up

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,559
to speed and start

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,520
leveraging actions today so github

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,280
actions they are

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,039
open source like the majority of actions

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,720
are open source projects

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,240
um that look like this

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,400
so this is a gig of action called get up

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,760
script and what i did with github script

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,440
earlier this year we hosted this thing

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,159
called the github hackathon

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,200
and the way we powered this hackathon is

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,760
we powered it with the

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,280
github repo um so all these submissions

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,880
here on the hackathon page

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,760
were also submissions that added json to

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,280
the this is a view app um so

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,679
specifically grid sub if you guys are

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,200
into

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,120
view but we would add json to a project

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,039
and then that json would then give us a

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
pr then that we would

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,240
leverage an action to basically check to

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,799
see if this

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,400
submission was valid so not only did i

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,840
check to see if the submission was valid

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,279
i checked it with an action

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,880
so i had an action that validated the

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,440
json that was submitted

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,400
and if you had the bare minimum of what

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,640
i asked for

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,679
inside the terms and conditions for the

00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,760
the hackathon

00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,679
then you would get you would get sort of

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,200
semi-approved so then at that point you

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,760
would be i would be mentioned

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,480
uh so we had three teammates on my um on

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,159
my team

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,919
that would get a mention that said okay

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,960
the pr is open the action's been

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,720
validated

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,159
so then at this point the only thing i

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,440
had to do is check to see if it should

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,159
be on the home page

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,600
so we had this github script that i

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,360
wrote so you can see the five lines of

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,039
javascript that i have below this is

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,559
directly in my yaml file

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,720
and i'm leveraging this using the github

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,400
action on line two uh which is just a

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,320
github repo that i just showed you

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,080
previously so this is like bare bones

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,840
like what actions

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,159
are and they're just basically github

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,600
repos that run arbitrary code

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,640
inside of your repos and uh

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,240
the way i did this is i had a

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,120
conditional that if it was either

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,600
featured

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,240
or labeled good then it would then merge

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
to pr

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,640
and then once you've merged a pr you

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,159
didn't been approved you've been

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
notified and said your actions would

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,000
approve

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,440
you will get your your swag um

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,120
later in the month which is basically

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,679
what we did so we automated that entire

00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,200
thing

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,039
and then if i had the feature label it'd

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,360
show up on the home page if i had the

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,799
good

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,559
labeled it'd just get merged but it

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,400
wouldn't get added to the home page as a

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,799
featured

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,760
featured github app and because i had

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,039
the github app

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,559
on my my phone i would basically just go

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,159
every morning go through all the pr's

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,840
that were opened and then i would go to

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,279
see if the readme was good see if the

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,360
action was like unique

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,720
um in the sense that like did they do

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,600
something novel was it interesting

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,880
should it does it

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,840
warrant being on the home page if it was

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,520
what i would do is i would then uh merge

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,760
that by adding a label so i had to get

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,919
an

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,919
action that once i added feature it

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,360
would actually merge that directly into

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,760
there and then i'd have it featured on

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,200
the homepage hopefully that makes sense

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,480
um this is something that we actually uh

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,480
we actually there's a blog post out

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,640
there publicly i don't have a link um

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,880
but we this sort of process of

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,760
leveraging automation to merchants prs

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,159
um was it was amazing actually like we

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
ended up

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,600
only doing those three team members we

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,360
had three team members because of time

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,480
zones so we had one person in australia

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,520
as i mentioned before we had another

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,120
person on the east coast

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,559
and that was on the west coast and we

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,640
just sort of cranked through

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,480
all the submissions and we validated all

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,440
submissions so the effort of us running

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,120
a hackathon

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
for a company like github with 50

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,640
million developers um

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,480
was pretty well uh all the effort went

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,279
into setting up the actual repo in the

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,799
site

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,480
which is what i want to work on i'd

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,120
rather work on that than answering

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,559
emails

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,360
so i'm going to hit a um a pause point

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,559
right now

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,600
um i have a youtube series called uh get

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,960
action traction so

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,520
if you wanted to see videos of how

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,799
github actions work uh i'll just drop

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,400
that link there right there

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:43,760
um but i wanted to actually move into

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,120
uh i do also have a repo as well um

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,840
so we have i think 10 minutes

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,679
i can't remember if um honestly i i

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,799
think i did i did this earlier or i did

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,960
this last year

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,400
there are two sessions and i believe

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,400
that we end this session in 10 minutes

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,520
so we'll have a second session

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,720
and at the top of the hour so what i'm

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,080
going to get at is

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,159
once again i'm going to drop this link

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,039
here and i think what we're gonna do

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,440
is i would like everybody to participate

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,480
in

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,520
the action by going to this repo

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,679
if you haven't done this already you

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,480
should read through uh

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,960
and then activate an action i've already

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,000
built

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,960
for everybody which is invite inviting

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,880
someone to your uh

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,200
the organization so this is a common

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,880
thing uh for workshop

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,679
uh workshop leads are sorry

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,559
teachers moderators uh well this is the

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,240
same session

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,360
or is it continuation it is what you

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,200
would like it to be so if you have

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,200
questions about actions i can actually

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,399
i can veer off into other directions

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,159
because the slides

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,240
the slides themselves are linked right

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,360
here and then this is also an open

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,200
source repo so um

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,240
once you've actually actually just see

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,960
if anybody's actually done this

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,960
we have

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,640
okay so we had a couple of people

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,240
actually trigger the action itself

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,919
uh what's cool about this is we have

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,120
roughly 200 people who are now

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,760
triggering action

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,360
uh and we can see that two minutes ago

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,880
oh looks like we had

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,240
okay cool so we have a bunch of actions

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,080
running so let me talk about the actions

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,159
that are running in this repo

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,440
they're all they're explained as well

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,360
but you can see that i'm inviting a

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,080
bunch of people into the organization

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,760
uh itself this is a very nice thing to

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,320
do if you especially in the remote world

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,080
like i don't want to take 200 emails and

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
try to invite everyone into this

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,159
this project but i have this action

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,240
called invite a contributor

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,360
if you're interested i just went to this

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,520
actions tab

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,279
here and that's how i get here uh if you

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,640
did not have any actions in your project

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,039
it would actually take you here

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,000
which gives you an option to add actions

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,480
uh there

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,760
are i don't know how many actions there

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,360
are there have to be at least two

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,320
thousand actions in the marketplace

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,559
themselves

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,919
so these are all marketplace actions uh

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,360
but there's a

00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,279
ton more actions that are actually

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,480
hosted open source that are available

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,840
to use so keep that in mind there is i

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,840
don't want to like

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,200
apple app store this thing and say like

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,720
there are actions for

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,320
everything uh i don't think there are

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,080
actions for everything yet

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,000
um but there are a lot of creative

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,840
actions uh so what i just did is i

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,559
clicked into the action for

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,200
uh scale something their name is

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,679
actually

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,559
off uh obstructed but what i'm getting

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,159
at is that i have an

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,480
action that it's called invite

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,399
contributor it's run

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,840
so it looks like it's uh blake neil is

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,440
the one that it ran

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,360
i'm actually printing that inside my

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,000
code to actually see who it is

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,679
um is it possible to trigger an

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,360
automation test to validate a feature

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,960
prior to

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:46,240
the merge yes um angie jones

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,080
actually has a action that she wrote um

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,000
for validation and doing integration

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,600
testing uh angie jones is actually i

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,559
don't know when she's speaking here at

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,799
this event

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,559
but she shared me her action and i don't

00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,480
have it actually offhand

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,039
um but there is it tomorrow

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,880
and i would struggle um she sent it to

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,279
me through

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,320
[Music]

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,600
yeah anyway she handles a lot of testing

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,840
uh cyprus has another one too as well um

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,720
i would also say inside the curriculum

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,399
too as well

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,000
there is an action for formatting

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,200
linting code as well

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,919
um so yeah this is this is this

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,120
um content is really for you to be go

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,760
through self-pace

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,960
and try it out yourself and then see

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,960
sort of

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,559
the stretch of what actions can do for

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,760
you basically and that's the hope for

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,200
this conversation

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,960
and that's what i'm probably going to

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,559
focus i'll probably focus less on slides

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,760
at the top of the hour and focus more on

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,360
sort of talking through

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,320
different actions so i might actually

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,960
just start with the basketball

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,840
references

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,279
just for the sake of time um but i did

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,799
want to point out real quick

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,120
as well that you do have uh this action

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,919
that's

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,159
completed and ran uh i can see the the

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,159
workflow file which i do also have

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,080
i can also click directly into it but

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,000
inside my github folder so the

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,000
github folder is a place where a lot of

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,640
like cool github features live

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,279
um there's a lot of like hidden tips and

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,200
tricks

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,799
um but the one thing i did want to point

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,279
out is that instead of

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,960
actually pointing to repo i'm actually

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,679
running my action directly in the same

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,679
repo

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,039
that i'm working out of so if i can

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,919
figure out how to

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,399
zoom out i have an action right here i

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,880
have

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,919
a ruby file i've got a docker file uh so

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,320
that's the other thing i could actually

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,919
run

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,919
actions directly within the project

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,440
itself by using docker

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,200
i do have a youtube video on how to

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,240
actually not use docker uh if you don't

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,640
want to use docker you can actually do

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,880
this with

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,120
action.yaml as well um it is in the

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,480
here come the notification emails oh you

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,279
know what that was the other thing

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,880
i forgot to turn that off i apologize

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,360
everybody if you are you're probably get

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,200
200 invite emails

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,880
um dad is right whoop all right

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,880
i wonder if i can fix that in 10 minutes

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,440
uh before in between sessions

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,960
uh but welcome to this workshop it uh

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,159
you're also testing your notification

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,919
emails as well

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:08,159
um yeah does everybody getting

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,880
i wonder is everybody getting oh it just

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,880
docks my uh

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,120
email

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,480
uh excellent lots and lots of emails you

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,640
know it's because i always i

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,240
actually forget about this because i

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,679
because i work at github i get emails

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,360
for everything that happens on github

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,039
so i actually turned off emails for

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,039
github so

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,000
yeah i don't know who that guy is but

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,000
yeah you blame him

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,320
but i did want to point out the code

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,320
that makes this work too as well

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,799
subject yeah well honestly if you want

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,360
to learn about automating your emails

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,240
too as well

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,720
i'm sure uh somebody can can run a

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,480
session

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,080
for that as well but i just wanted to

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,600
point out that i am using octokit to

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,200
make this run i did write this in ruby

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,399
where i can write this in python or

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,039
javascript or whatnot

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,080
i chose ruby because really because i

00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,760
just wanted to write ruby

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,760
um to make this work i haven't wrote

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,440
ruby in a long time uh but i'm looking

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,120
for the word invite

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,960
uh you can also write the word invite me

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,320
as well actually that's what i said you

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,600
could invite me or you could write

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,600
a handle so if you want to invite

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,760
somebody else you can do that as well

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,960
but yeah these are my 30 lines of ruby

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,039
code to make this work

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,080
uh we automate our way into this i guess

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,440
automate our way out

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,559
yes exactly you know and honestly i

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,120
think it's because um i wonder if i can

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,919
turn off

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,039
emails here um but yeah that this is

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,720
pretty much

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:40,399
um i guess the the

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:41,919
crux how do i don't think i can

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,519
it's not the most yeah i think it's

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,279
going to be the notifications are going

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,360
to be an individual basis so like

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,480
i got zero emails from all this and i i

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,399
always

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,600
i've done this workshop the sixth the

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,039
second time i've done this this year but

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,360
this is the largest crowd i've done this

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,720
for

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,200
so my apologies um yeah usually it's

00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,360
like

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,720
like 15 people who um who end up getting

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,840
the emails but

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,240
yeah here we are all right so that is

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,559
that

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,360
um i did want to walk through the rest

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,359
of it um

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,159
is there a reason for a per private repo

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,839
license don't include github actions

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,440
um per private repo license don't

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,560
include

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,720
github actions oh yeah so

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,919
it's it is because you are using an

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,240
older version of github

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,119
so if you are so is that the you're

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,280
paying per

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,960
not per user but for how many repos you

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,800
can have uh we made a

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,399
change so a little bit of inside

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,599
basketball or inside baseball whatever

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,960
to call it we made a change in the

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,599
pricing we made github free for

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,079
everybody

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,079
uh this is really to unlock um to make

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,480
it easier for folks to leverage github

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,520
we also made a change to how the pricing

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,879
structure works

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,440
for teams as well which i believe

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,320
github teams is either free or a much

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,159
cheaper

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,400
uh than it was previously for that

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,800
reason but we also made changes to

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,599
how we do pricing with private repos

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,520
because

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,359
the amount you only have a limited you

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,599
only get two thousand action minutes

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,599
um per um

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,079
organization um so in order to get more

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,520
action minutes you will need to

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,440
i had this i slowed down on that because

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
i had to think about how the structure

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,079
the pricing is

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,440
again i work with mostly free customers

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,960
and open source so i don't really know

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,200
the pricing off the bat

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,400
um but i bring that up because that's

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,400
that's why

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
that is why it's limited uh it's because

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,440
you're the way the building works it

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,400
doesn't work well uh with the older

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,800
version

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,400
um yeah uh any other questions

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,160
uh automatically send us a github

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,280
actions yeah licenses know where the

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,359
live testings yeah

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,520
so yeah that is that is pretty much it i

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,480
think uh i'll drop in the link again for

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,119
the repo

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,000
um it will have to miss the second part

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,440
of this talk but

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,440
so far it's really interesting i plan on

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,240
running through sample repo checking and

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,200
get actions

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,880
yeah and i have thank you very much

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,599
thanks for stopping by joe

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,880
as well um yeah there's lots of

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,079
information about actions that i've been

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,440
putting out in the open that's why i

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,160
pointed the youtube video that's why i

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,320
have the

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,760
the repo which is get action traction as

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,440
well um

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,880
where you could if you have specific

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,480
questions for actions

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,320
feel free to ask them there i do reserve

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,240
the right to point you to support if you

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,800
have a specific question about your

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,320
use case uh but get out back get action

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,839
traction is the place that i've been

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,240
sort of funneling all my

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,720
experience uh actually the videos are

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,400
what

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,920
is what really came out of the the

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,960
workshop that i've been doing so

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,079
craftwork became the traction and um

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,960
that is where i'm at so i

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,240
i will actually where can i find the

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,560
this panel recording

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,839
uh that is a question for the uh we do

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,200
have a help desk here for all things

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,240
open so you can ask it there

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,320
i believe it's probably in the

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,520
frequently asked questions as well uh i

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,119
don't know where the recording will be

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,320
to be quite honest uh but it will be

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,640
available

00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,640
and

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,000
here we are

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,800
also i highly recommend check out um

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,760
your github notifications and filtering

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,400
those

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,119
i personally have turned up all my

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,760
notifications

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,040
because i exclusively use the github app

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,760
as well as

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,119
the notification panel so here i've got

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,839
i've got a notification for everybody

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,839
who's been invited

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,160
here okay so you're actually getting

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,680
notifications on actions not actually

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,000
invites that's why

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,839
i also have those turned off but that

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,839
helps because i can actually

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,560
go into my actions and turn those off um

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,800
here we go questions second part

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,359
recorded for those who may be able to

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,680
attend

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,920
yeah second part world would be recorded

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,280
uh i believe so

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,240
just trying to share with my teammates

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,839
who are unable to come yep

00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,000
but i also have done anything other than

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,680
watch excellent yeah if you

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,200
if you didn't join then you won't get

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:08,560
the notifications there we go

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:18,480
oh please don't guess my password

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:19,440
all right um

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,440
set up email address every

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,200
simplification to purchase our truck

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,280
triggered

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,760
uh i want to be able to turn this off i

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,079
knew

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,280
sorry i haven't actually uh beyonce

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,720
question mark

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,839
uh a true developer never tells

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,119
um yeah

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,560
my thought was that the notification

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,599
would actually be off because i don't

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,599
have them turned on but

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,599
that is something i didn't even get to i

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,839
i want to do a video on artifacts

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,839
in the the future all right

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,839
zero cool that's a good one hack the

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,200
planet

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:03,200
um excellent

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,280
i'm happy to answer more questions too

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,320
as well um i

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,520
wonder if how many folks

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,720
actually how many folks are going to

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,160
stick around and say yes if you're

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,320
sticking around for the second half

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:22,000
all right everybody all right so

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,000
let me find the chat real quick again

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,200
all right well for those who stuck

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,880
around those are all the

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,280
hardcore folks who really want to learn

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,359
about actions um let me close that zoom

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,480
link as well

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,400
playing the stick around schedule is

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,079
sort of improv with work yeah that's the

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,400
beauty of um

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,079
you know the online remote conferences i

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,599
tend to always have on open

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,599
while i'm doing emails or like

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,720
engage very few conferences i'm like

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,560
super active in

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,160
and like it's usually the keynotes is

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,280
usually the part that i'm usually super

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,440
active and engaged in

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,320
uh the rest of it i'm sort of it's like

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,240
a buffet

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,240
at this point um online events

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,079
all right all right so i see the number

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,680
climbing back up

00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,119
um since we have a lot of people

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,480
sticking around um

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,640
i will probably in 15 minutes do a

00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,760
re-run

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:19,520
of just the the mba portion of the talk

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,560
um but i did want to walk through

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,319
the rest of this uh i think i did talk

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,839
about github notifications too as well

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:28,079
and being able to turn those off

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,359
um my assumption was that i was only

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,200
going to be the one getting action

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,720
notifications but they changed that i

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,760
forget when they changed that but now

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,520
anybody in the org could see

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,280
notifications as well

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,160
um how did i make that gif

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,960
this i assume this is what you're asking

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,760
about

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,520
so i made the i made the actual logo in

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,800
sketch because it's the only design

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,400
tool i know how to use um and then i

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,079
actually had somebody who i know who

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,920
does after effects animations

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,440
i told them exactly what i wanted and

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,319
then they just did it so that's how i

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,000
did it

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:03,440
uh i asked a friend it's the easiest

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,280
sometimes the hardest way to get things

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,480
done because you never know when you're

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,800
gonna get it done but um

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,000
yeah that is that's pretty much how i

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,040
did it

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,400
i think i was up watching a i wasn't

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,040
watching another video it's watching

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,720
something

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,319
oh it's a tutorial on how to actually do

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,920
that and i got like

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,760
some of it done but then i couldn't

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,880
figure out the rest uh which is

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,200
basically the 8-bit

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,440
there's a 8-bit filter in after effects

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,040
um and then

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,040
the rest of it is just like generic

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,839
after effects stuff like blinking

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,839
and changing stuff all right

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,880
so the second session was meant to cover

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,480
the rest of

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,040
this i was going to walk through this

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,359
as well as i think the the the best part

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,359
is actually talking about

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,960
all the different types of actions and

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,560
the sort of fielding questions if people

00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,640
had questions around

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,240
um different ideas for automation um

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,680
but perhaps what i'll do since we're

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,800
sort of transitioning and

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,000
a lot of the folks who have uh who are

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
here now we're here for the first

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,640
session

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,920
um i want to talk about some actions

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,200
that i use

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,240
today to sort of expand the scope

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,960
of folks's thoughts of actions so

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,440
this project itself uh the duck pond

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,839
mentioned

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,599
their workshops are recorded uh i should

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:30,160
probably

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:34,319
uh i think the workshops are recorded uh

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,400
i mean oh you know what

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,359
so like normally in person the workshops

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,480
are not recorded

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:45,599
um but to be honest

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,520
i should know this because i can see

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,319
i can hit the record button so i assume

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,319
they're not recorded

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,319
so i guess what you see is what you get

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,000
yeah because last year and um

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,560
the zoom window says it's recording oh

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
does it okay so yeah it um

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,880
then i guess it won't be recorded not to

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,760
keep you from getting through it you

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,520
won't need to what

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,319
yeah i was saying like last year i was

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:09,119
in person at the event in north carolina

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,920
and uh the of my workshop was not

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,040
recorded

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,400
um so my expectation is that not all of

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,920
them would be recorded i think the

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,640
keynotes and main stages usually are

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,920
recorded

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,760
but um it looks like it's something it's

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,800
recording if not

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:26,079
i'm available um on the internet

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,599
um using my i have a github and i have a

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,760
twitter

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,000
which i didn't even slow down and even

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,000
show

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,400
my github all right so i'm going to jump

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,599
in i'm going to talk about a couple

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,560
actions then i'm going to move it back

00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,079
to the nba

00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,440
explanation and then i'm going to go

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,400
through the rest of the workshop

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,640
material so

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,839
uh we're just going to start now uh so i

00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,960
wanted to point out real quick so this

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,880
is my repo

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,480
uh i wanted to briefly mention that this

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,880
is run by a git of action

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,480
so github profile readme's were thing

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,880
that we shipped in august

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,079
it's basically you can actually have

00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,839
extra stuff

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,240
in your repo i actually have the action

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,520
turned off uh for reasons that i need to

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,760
fix later today

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,520
um but the cool thing about this is that

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,119
this repo itself is powered by the

00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,079
github action

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,920
and i could show you here so i had an

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,800
idea of basically taking the profile

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,040
readme

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,160
and making a myspace page and the way i

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,000
do it is

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,800
and i think i have a

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,160
i have an older version so you can see

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,119
that i have a github action that

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,400
actually is

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,160
um adding folks here so

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,680
honestly i forgot to actually even look

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,000
at this but yeah other people have

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,079
actually added themselves

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,520
added themselves to my my top eight

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,400
which i encouraged folks to do a couple

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,560
months ago i haven't

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,400
been paying attention this previously

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:49,280
but the way this works is i have a

00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,400
developers.yaml and if folks add

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,240
themselves to the list

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,000
uh it will actually add the top eight so

00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,160
i just i'd adjust the list

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,359
to create a top eight and then i have an

00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,319
action that basically

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,119
populates and creates this this read me

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,760
so

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,040
and the way that works here is i do have

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,760
a ruby file

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,240
create readme i have an action that runs

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,960
this

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,839
this ruby code again i was really into

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,440
writing ruby

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,440
uh earlier this year so um there it is

00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,200
so yeah this this is the ruby code that

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,599
creates the readme itself

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:27,359
uh and then this is the if i go into

00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,400
older branch this is the github action

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:31,680
that generates that

00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,319
oop so i just hit back okay here we go

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,079
so every time an issue is opened and

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,880
that's the other thing i ask people to

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,040
open issues

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,079
to add themselves so every time an issue

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,520
is opened

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,920
it runs this this arbitrary code here

00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,599
that sets up ruby so you can actually

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,800
set up the environment so we do have a

00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,000
virtual environment that actually

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,280
includes ruby

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,520
um it has also ruby version two six uh

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,040
if you're familiar ruby or python or

00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,920
whatnot it installs

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,520
the dependencies uh and then finally it

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,520
runs that ruby file

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,720
and then creates a that ruby script

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,440
actually creates a

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,680
temporary text file to sort of

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,119
manipulate and create the the readme

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,480
and then um oh and then finally it

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,319
creates a pull request

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,079
so if this has been successful it will

00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,520
create a pull request uh and it'll

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,240
actually leverage that person's name as

00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,839
a title

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,760
uh which you can see at least one

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,160
successful one here which is

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,040
sean grove who added this uh quite a few

00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,800
months ago

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,200
so my github action not only does all

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,599
that stuff it also creates a pr

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,480
uh adds a note to close that issue

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,520
that's open

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,280
uh so this is the issue that sean opened

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,560
and this issue also gets created from a

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,520
template as well so

00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,000
i've automated mated creating a top

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,760
eight

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
similar to like what myspace was back

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,359
what man

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,400
12 years ago no longer than that 15

00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:55,040
years ago

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,319
um so that that's one action um

00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,000
definitely check out you can check that

00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:01,119
out on my my actual bw

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,480
profile uh it's linked pretty easily uh

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,480
what i did want to talk about is some

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,839
actions that i use here instead of my

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,200
open source project open source is a

00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,240
project to find your next open source

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,599
contribution

00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,839
uh we were participating in

00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,760
hacktoberfest uh and

00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:15,760
one of the things i like to do is i have

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,680
this welcome.yaml

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,680
and this welcome that yaml is every time

00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:23,040
someone opens a pull request

00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:25,200
um there's a note that i i'm gonna make

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,640
in a second about the target so normally

00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,400
this would say pull requests

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,760
uh but i'll make a note about target i'm

00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,319
just saying it out loud so i can slow

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,599
down and

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:35,280
and mention that um but every time

00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,200
someone opens up a pull request and it's

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,280
your first pull request for the project

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,040
i want to actually create a note that

00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,160
says hey welcome thanks for making your

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,520
pull request

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,839
and taking the time to improve open

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,200
sauce you know make them feel welcomed

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,680
even though this is a bot that's doing

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,280
this say hello by joining the discord

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,800
and i did this intentionally because

00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,800
during hacktoberfest you get a lot of

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,920
prs for folks

00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,839
sometimes there's an issue attached

00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,040
sometimes to the issue that's not and i

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,960
wanted folks to

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,280
not only open up the pr but come and say

00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,800
hello

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,280
full disclosure you get a better chance

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,280
of me merging your pr if you say hello

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,119
versus i just get a bunch of pr's that

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,720
are

00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,520
on random things that i wasn't looking

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,880
for so this is one actually i did

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,720
merge because it was actually a really

00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,880
good one this was random

00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,480
and during hacktoberfest uh but actually

00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,599
this was really good code so i was like

00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,760
i need this

00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,800
um and it actually was solving a problem

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,839
that i didn't know

00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,200
uh but there's one that actually talked

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,319
to jerry about this

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,640
uh and he opened it up um so

00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,160
he got the generic welcome message he

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,760
joined the the discord

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,880
and what happened when he joined the

00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,160
discord is i was able to have the

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,400
conversation with him

00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,920
um which was this right here i still put

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,800
i put posted this here just for the

00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,440
context

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,119
uh for the storytelling aspect of it uh

00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,040
but we chatted in discord

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,319
and it was mainly because all this stuff

00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,559
wasn't filled out

00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,680
and i wanted him to the reason i do the

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,000
welcome

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,359
message in the discord using an action

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,720
instead of doing it

00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,640
on my own and he would have to wait

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,240
until i would like wake up or

00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,880
until i was ready to actually message

00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,960
him so i do this because i want to have

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,800
that engagement that interaction

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,480
and then i can answer from discord

00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,480
pretty easily um

00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,400
so i guess what i'm rambling about and

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,640
getting at is that i was able to

00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,319
get him to fill out the rest of his

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,880
description and the discord

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,680
because this was a confusing problem

00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,680
that he

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,760
identified but he didn't do any

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,520
identification directly here

00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,119
so that way other people who are

00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,960
contributing on the project they

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,480
have context of what's happening here

00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,599
and i really i really

00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,720
want the history of my code to

00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,440
um to be available for folks to go back

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,640
and learn

00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,800
why are we using this webpack plug-in um

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,640
the the real main reason is because we

00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,599
basically stopped supportive note eight

00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,359
at this point

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,040
um and i had to make that very clear so

00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,520
i was able to talk to him he was able to

00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,599
update

00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,520
update the readme update everything else

00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,240
to say okay we can only use node 10 and

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,480
beyond

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,839
um so if it does if this project does

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,839
not work for you it's very clear in the

00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,839
contributing md that it doesn't work

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,280
because you're not using a newer version

00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,520
of node

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,800
which i do all the time so we're able to

00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,880
go back and forth to do that

00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,119
um there's a couple other things that i

00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,319
do about i use actions for but what i

00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,760
want to do all sessions are being

00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,040
recorded and will be made after the

00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,559
conference thank you

00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:30,240
all right answered question um

00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,920
so i bring that up because that is a

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,319
real life use case of how i leverage

00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,920
actions i am overusing actions in this

00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:38,720
project to be quite honest

00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,680
um not only am i doing the welcome bot

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,680
it's great

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,839
there's another action that i i love

00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,960
using which is called take action

00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:49,280
and the way this works is i'm actually

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:54,640
pointing this to another repo

00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:57,200
which is here it's a repo that i created

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,240
there there is not such thing as too

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,480
much automation

00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,680
thank you thanks for having my back um

00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,920
but yeah here are the like the

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,800
sort of light instructions i did drop my

00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,079
youtube account

00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,079
uh in the chat earlier um so for folks

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:13,520
who are interested in

00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,880
checking out how this project is made

00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,680
because this is actually the subject of

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,160
my

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,880
my youtube series for github action get

00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,880
action traction

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,520
excellent so i'll just drop the the

00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,960
playlist here um for folks who want to

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,640
watch that on their own time um but

00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,640
what what i'm getting at is when i have

00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,839
a contributor of the project

00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,280
a lot of times especially during

00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:39,599
hacktoberfest i get a lot of folks who

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,200
who want to work on issues uh but then

00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,680
they find out very quickly

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,800
though i have 22 issues only actually we

00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,920
do have quite a few more that we've

00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,040
actually created

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,839
um only eight of them are unassigned

00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,359
and the reason for that is because i i

00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,480
encourage people if you want to work on

00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,839
something on the project if you're just

00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,280
driving by or just

00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:03,359
just want to try out a react graphql

00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:06,400
site or a project i i recommend folks to

00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,880
assign themselves to the issue and the

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,040
way

00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,800
we do this is i have it clearly

00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,880
identified here

00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,720
to type the word dot take in the

00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,079
comments so similar to what we did with

00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,160
the invite me

00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,680
you could also do take uh using my

00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,599
action that i created so

00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,200
um i create a lot of these little small

00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,880
actions because i know

00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,040
if i got on this call with 200 people

00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,680
again i i can't take 200 emails

00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,400
and then add them to a list and then and

00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,680
include them

00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,200
um actually historically github well i

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,800
actually took this from github's

00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,880
onboarding experience so if you start as

00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,599
a new engineer at github or new employee

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,000
github

00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,599
uh we basically have everybody join an

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,559
org and then they teach them how to use

00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,640
github and git

00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,920
so this is for marketing sales pretty

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,359
much everybody who starts a job at

00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,280
github you go through the onboarding and

00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,960
they teach you how to use github and get

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,119
uh and the way they do that is they it

00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,319
adds you you have to go into a

00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,880
issue and and then at um

00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,640
mention your handle or your name and

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,960
then that name will then

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,640
uh be added to the org so i just took

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,720
that from our onboarding class

00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,240
and uh figured out how to do that uh

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,599
shout out to express for their triage

00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,040
team i have a triage team

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,440
um so yeah there is that

00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,520
for those who are here and sitting uh i

00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,720
do want to

00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,040
respect that some people weren't here

00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,520
for the last session so if

00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,200
you just stopped by um the question is

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,319
do you know about get of actions would

00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,359
you like me

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,720
to i can re-go through um just sort of

00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,640
high-level github actions

00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,319
and then we can jump into the the actual

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,960
material itself

00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:41,119
interesting do you parse all of them

00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,040
looking for that key and then switch

00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,800
does that open up the code injection

00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:48,079
into actions

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,440
um so yeah it is possible um for code

00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,680
injection and actions

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,760
and part of the reason why my my myspace

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,040
action is shut off because there was an

00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,920
opportunity for people to

00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,680
inject any code they wanted to um i do

00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,720
cover this actually i covered in a video

00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,440
i haven't shipped yet

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,319
um actually i'm editing it right now but

00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,160
yeah

00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:08,160
because let me

00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,119
show this so this one it will be a

00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,559
little more challenging to inject code

00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,280
because i actually have this directly

00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,880
running

00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,720
uh so this was a bash script that i was

00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,319
running uh

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,640
here i think github does a really good

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,160
job of actually um

00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,720
preventing folks from doing whatever you

00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,839
want that was the thing i wanted to ask

00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,760
so david great question um

00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,880
so one answer is the fact that i have

00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,880
this in

00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,880
action.yaml i can actually sanitize the

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,400
access to this github token

00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,559
so that way not anybody can just do

00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,160
whatever they want um

00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,599
the sometimes the challenge is that you

00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,920
could actually run arbitrary code inside

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,599
of

00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,040
issue comments too as well like i can

00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,400
run actions on issue comments

00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,240
you could technically do some code

00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,520
injection if you wanted to

00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,280
but github does a really good job at

00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,559
sanitizing a lot of the stuff

00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,720
um but i did forget that the one thing i

00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:03,760
wanted to mention too as well

00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:03,760
is the pull request target

00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,960
and that was this one so

00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,559
this right here uh and this has been a

00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,920
it's a common

00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,480
sort of like i guess fumble not fumble

00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,640
but

00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,079
folks who get involved in actions like

00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,119
the some of the common use cases are

00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,880
open source things

00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,559
so if i run an open source project let's

00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,440
just say i run rust

00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,160
or let's say python i run a python

00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,680
project

00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,200
i want people to be able to interact

00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,720
with my project

00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,839
so the way i'm gonna do this is i'm

00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,799
gonna have an action that runs on pull

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,559
request

00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:39,839
now the problem is that github token

00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,839
that i was just talking about that i

00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:45,119
have access to here

00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:48,160
this runs on the github token for the

00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,319
person who triggers the action so if

00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,440
david triggers the action to open a pr

00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:53,920
my project

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,839
it will leverage his github token if

00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,799
david doesn't have access to

00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,680
open a pr inside my org the action will

00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,520
fail

00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,200
and the way to get around this and

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,400
something to be very clear of like you

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,160
are getting around this

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,079
and letting i'm letting david actually

00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,160
open up a pr on my project

00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,319
by adding this target so what happens

00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,839
with this is that i'm telling github

00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:16,880
actions to use my token

00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:20,160
the token that's directly that's on

00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,839
uh me as the maintainer of the org so

00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,799
that way anybody who does not only has

00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,480
just a fork

00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,920
can actually run their actions and they

00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,960
will actually sorry they can run actions

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,400
based on their pr

00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,119
and it will work because it's actually

00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,559
running on my target not on his

00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,920
or theirs um so hopefully to answer

00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,680
questions for

00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,319
um yeah for like uh code ejection as

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,599
well

00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:44,160
um i would say if you go in the

00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,119
community

00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,440
forum a lot of folks like if you go to

00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,839
this

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,960
github dot community there are a lot of

00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,480
questions and like why

00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,480
actions aren't doing the what they think

00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,280
they can and usually the answer is

00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,079
because

00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,599
of security um so like a lot of times

00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,160
people want to do some like really nifty

00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,359
things

00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,599
one of the most common things people

00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:06,000
want to do is push to protected branches

00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,799
now if your branch is protected in that

00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,319
you could only

00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,720
you could only merge things if it's been

00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:13,920
approved then

00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,040
that is it makes sense on why actions

00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,119
cannot merge

00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,400
a branch uh even if it's a it's

00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,680
automated bot

00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,240
because you could also trigger the

00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,040
action as a non code owner of the

00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,880
project

00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,559
so there's like a lot of limitations

00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,839
there there's a lot of work

00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,400
there's some workarounds that people

00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:31,440
have shared but if you yeah if you go in

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,440
the code like

00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,799
i've seen this community forum since its

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,240
inception um

00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:38,000
because we migrated from another

00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,559
platform so all these questions are

00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,760
pretty much

00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,880
since action started and what i'm

00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,720
getting at is that

00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,319
a lot of the sort of edge cases she's

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,520
here to hit is around

00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:51,839
access and token um management

00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,920
and it really just comes down to like

00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,559
how much access are you trying to give

00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,920
and if you

00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,160
are really trying to give away a bunch

00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,720
of access my recommendation is you

00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,040
probably should

00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,559
build an integration a proper github app

00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,280
and that's where github apps really come

00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,240
in

00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,680
in the consideration too as well so i

00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,119
briefly mentioned in the last session

00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,359
the difference between github apps

00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,040
and github actions get apps being

00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,200
something that you install on the repo

00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,799
and gives access to all the repo which

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,680
is what everybody wants to do with

00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,599
actions

00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,960
um but i think when you hit that sort of

00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,799
that ceiling of like

00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,000
i have a token it should be able to push

00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:26,240
to a protected branch

00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,200
but it can't it's because you should use

00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,640
a github app

00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,240
because the github app will will give

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,319
you all that access so

00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,799
that was a roundabout way to get to here

00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:37,119
uh but i did want to talk about

00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,640
uh workflow automation as well first

00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,960
this is a refresher

00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,839
uh for github actions their focus here

00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,480
is actually the

00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,520
take logic uh an arbitrary logic that

00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,839
you want to do and

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,200
rinse and repeat and hopefully sanitize

00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,720
if you're using tokens

00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,559
uh and it builds stuff on top of the

00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,520
github api that's what actions is really

00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,720
meant for it's

00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:00,000
to give you better hooks and to github

00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:01,200
into the github api so going back to the

00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,960
basketball

00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:07,280
analogy which i won't harp too much but

00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,880
my my analogy for welcoming new

00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,680
contributors by pointing them to the

00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,920
discord

00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,799
is something that i i know was a falling

00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,640
off point for anybody who wants to

00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:20,960
um does github offer or suggest trading

00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,040
for an entire org or devs to level up

00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,559
uh yes we do have github trading but

00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:28,240
usually it's attached to

00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:29,599
your paid account um

00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,599
so yeah we do have a training team but

00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,599
it's like really i think it's mostly on

00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,920
the enterprise side

00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,760
uh we do have a lab course too as well

00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,359
which i do have a slide for

00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,200
um but your whole team can actually go

00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,400
through training that self-paced and a

00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,359
lot of the trainings that we give to the

00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,720
enterprises

00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:48,559
uh they're also distilled these

00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,559
trainings here lab.github.com

00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:53,920
there are also trainings on devops and

00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,920
actions as well

00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,040
uh devops with github actions so if you

00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,200
want to like

00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,400
level up there you go it sounds like it

01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,520
looks like there's only david's in the

01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,400
chat too as well

01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,119
anybody else besides david here uh just

01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,319
kidding

01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:14,079
all right so uh i bring this up because

01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:16,799
yeah my analogy for full court

01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,359
full court uh layups is that i'm not a

01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,760
david

01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:22,079
thank you welcome uh this is another

01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,079
dave

01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,960
oh just david's uh jonathan's

01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,319
masquerading as a david

01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,880
um this was the

01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:37,760
the only date this is the david session

01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,520
uh what a what a popular name

01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,040
my my dad's name is david and my

01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,760
brother's name is david

01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,880
so i i missed the um i missed a david

01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,119
call

01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,559
um but yeah going back to the welcome

01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:51,599
session like the welcome

01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:53,680
bot that is that is what i was really

01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,119
one of the sort of mentioned that i knew

01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,960
that every time someone

01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,160
contributed to the code base a lot of

01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,119
times so a lot of times the project that

01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,720
i work on

01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,960
um open source like a lot of people

01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,799
don't know what to do with it so

01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,480
a way for me to get feedback directly

01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:08,559
and not have to wait through

01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,720
uh issue comments is actually get them

01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,640
in the discourse as fast as possible

01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,920
and then have a conversation with them

01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,040
and ask them what they think and what

01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,640
they think like what

01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,079
what are places that we can have new

01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,520
features like i get to have a

01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,880
conversation with folks and

01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,559
it's this way it's a way for me to sort

01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,400
of have that conversation and

01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,319
if i have a captive audience that's

01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,160
really why i do that

01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:30,799
um and the other thing is like being

01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:33,200
able to pass the ball to area 31 which

01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:35,359
is again the highest rated place to

01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,400
make points on the basketball court is

01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,079
area 31

01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,599
so the thing that i do with the take

01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,359
issue um

01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,440
like i know if someone wants to work on

01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,880
something and i know i'm gonna be with

01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,480
the kids all day when doing some

01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,000
some other stuff like i can't respond to

01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,839
them and assign their issues

01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,520
um because i have to shut myself off

01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:54,079
from from working even for

01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,280
open source stuff um i want them to be

01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,280
able to take the issue so

01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,319
if i see someone that's like hey i want

01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,640
to take this issue

01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:01,599
i respond back with the save reply that

01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,280
says

01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,640
read the contributing id on how to

01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:08,720
actually take issues

01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,400
excellent so and then we're we're really

01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,240
focused around identifying repeated

01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,039
tasks and automating those

01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,240
uh and i mentioned get a hackathon as a

01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,200
a sort of case study

01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,640
on how we automated using labels to

01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,520
merge in prs

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,039
um and that's what that looks like so

01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,559
with that

01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:28,640
and i think for the most part i see a

01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,280
lot of familiar names from the last time

01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,440
so

01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,039
i'm gonna assume that folks uh the

01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,319
majority of us had war from the last

01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,240
time

01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:38,160
but if you weren't what i'm going to do

01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,119
is just drop in the slides

01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,920
and then drop in the workshop material

01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,319
as well

01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,839
which i want to make sure i'm giving you

01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:48,960
the right

01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,359
link and then we don't have to go to the

01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,119
invent

01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:53,200
invite me stuff because we did notice

01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:55,119
that the notifications will blow up

01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,880
um for everybody uh since they're

01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,359
actually enabled and i was mentioning

01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,920
this

01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:01,200
before and then we got cut off but um

01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,559
yeah that was a recent change that

01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,400
everybody gets notifications

01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:06,319
and i just distinctly remember who asked

01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,760
for this uh in the open source world

01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:10,000
uh where they wanted the entire team to

01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,319
be notified when actions failed or ran

01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,440
um and not before it was just the the

01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:16,799
repo owner

01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,599
um so let's move on for that

01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,039
there was an action um that i wanted to

01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:24,960
talk about too as well

01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:26,240
uh which is part one of this tutorial um

01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,000
actually there was an action that i

01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,520
wanted to mention too as well which

01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,039
this will automatically fail because

01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,400
we're gonna have merge conflicts uh

01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:36,319
because of folks

01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,319
um yeah i don't know who that guy is

01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,839
uh that's the old that's the uh the

01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,880
other brian

01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:46,400
there's at least two of us here today um

01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,119
so uh that take you are the order it

01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,000
takes vr

01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,039
yeah so this is a base an action that i

01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,480
have running

01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:58,799
um where i ask you to add your name

01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:01,039
to um a pr and i think there should be

01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,839
at least one merged yeah so ten minutes

01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:04,720
ago

01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:06,160
um i'm gonna assume this is another

01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,240
david too as well

01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,200
but um uh this person actually opened a

01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,760
pr

01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,960
to add their name to the list and that's

01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,240
literally what it is i should probably

01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,200
delete all those names in the list

01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,160
eventually

01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,440
um but a couple things happened uh one

01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,839
thing that's happened is that this was

01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,200
actually

01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:25,920
labeled so not only was this pr created

01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:27,039
um by this person it was labeled by a

01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:30,079
github action

01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:32,960
it was also merged by github action

01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,520
um and then eventually deleted as well

01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,119
um

01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,720
and the way i'm doing this is i have

01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:42,079
this auto merge

01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:42,079
file i just grabbed here we go

01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,440
so it's called auto approve so two

01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,319
actions that are running directly in

01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,160
this repo

01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,520
uh and this is the way i'm doing it so

01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,240
i'm running on pull request

01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,599
so keep in mind um this is not on target

01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,640
this is actually a pull request so this

01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,680
actually

01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:59,599
um at the time of me creating this this

01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,960
actually one year ago when i created

01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:02,319
this workshop for the first time to run

01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,640
it all things open

01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:07,119
um i created this action workflow

01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:10,079
because pull request target did not work

01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:11,680
so this specifically is on pull request

01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,920
and that's why i've invited everybody to

01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:16,400
the repo so actually i can remove that

01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,760
as part of the workshop eventually but i

01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,000
did want to point out that

01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,280
uh harry created an action called auto

01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,359
approve action

01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,200
um and the reason i'm doing this is

01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:29,200
because i needed an event to happen

01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:31,520
to then trigger a label being added so

01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,280
i do want to point out that github

01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,960
actions are run

01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,720
based on github repos so harry

01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,079
actually created this repo to auto

01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,240
approve um

01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,240
pull request uh you can see harry also

01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,839
is using pull request target so he's

01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,359
he's more up to date than i am i

01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,559
actually need to update this

01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:50,079
and honestly i didn't even think about

01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,039
that until the question came up from

01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,480
david earlier

01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,319
um that that would have been a blocker

01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,160
but yeah

01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,240
can't post a gif but imagine beyonce

01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:03,359
singing who runs the world

01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:05,839
who runs the world david's all right um

01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:07,680
yeah so that's that's harry's action um

01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:09,200
let me see if i can get back to the repo

01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,319
that was just in

01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,640
oh here we go um the other thing i want

01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:17,440
to mention too in part three of this

01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,559
workshop itself so again uh i dropped

01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,720
the links but i mentioned

01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:22,559
that all the all the content that i'm

01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,480
going over can be self-paced

01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,480
so i am bouncing around providing

01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,480
context because i think the better

01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,760
what i can give you here in only 45

01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,119
minutes is context

01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,039
uh everything else you could probably do

01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:36,079
in an hour uh on your own

01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,119
and your own pace as well um but

01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,760
i didn't want to point out that i am

01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:42,400
passing in a github token um

01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,599
this github token is leveraged directly

01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,119
in harry's code

01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,559
um this is actually in you can now infer

01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,079
github tokens so at the time of this

01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,520
creation of this this project

01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,359
you had to do this you actually this is

01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,839
not required anymore uh to be quite

01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,520
honest

01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:58,480
uh because github tokens are already

01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:01,520
available as you saw in my previous

01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,280
github uh token here for take action uh

01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,200
take action being the project that's the

01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,839
subject of my youtube series

01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,839
all right so

01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:12,160
let's uh close some of this stuff too as

01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,640
well also feel free to drop in questions

01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,319
if

01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,920
there's some context that is missed and

01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:18,559
lost um

01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,240
that's what i wanted to do um inside a

01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:21,119
github action workflow you can run 20

01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,559
jobs

01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,240
and just uh

01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,160
to point this out to you i'm not just

01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:31,359
i'm basically giving you the workshop

01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:34,079
part three um without reading it

01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:34,079
uh but i think

01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,760
20 jobs uh you know actually i don't

01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:41,520
actually link it here

01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,520
but note that you have 20 jobs that can

01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,799
run within a workflow at a time

01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,599
uh so i can actually run 20 jobs uh at

01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:50,480
the same time

01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:51,680
if i wanted to uh at the moment i'm just

01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,200
running one

01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,200
and inside those jobs you can have

01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,760
synchronous steps as well

01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,119
so these steps will run one after the

01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,280
other so this one will run

01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,319
if this one passes it does not fail then

01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,559
this one will run

01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:06,240
and knowing that once i've approved the

01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:09,359
action i'm basically

01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:11,039
when approved i just want this to

01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:13,039
run and get approved i'm then going to

01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:14,480
add a new label called auto merge

01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:16,640
and then i have a whole other action

01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,040
that's called auto merge action

01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,640
uh which is running on my bot branch i

01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,920
didn't point that out to you as well you

01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,839
could run these on targets

01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,440
so i'm running this on a tag i'm running

01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:26,799
this on a branch i'm running this on a

01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,960
branch

01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:30,480
um and again these are github repos so

01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,560
this is how i'm i'm basically

01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,239
doing that is there a reason to run that

01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,679
many uh when jobs

01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:40,799
versus steps um yes

01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,480
and i have i have an action which this

01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:44,319
is open source too as well

01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,560
uh this is the biggest action i have

01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:49,839
ever seen in my life

01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:53,120
and this person actually came in

01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,920
through well i pointed them to support

01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,480
because

01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,679
um i didn't have an answer um but

01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:00,560
there's an action limit

01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:01,199
as well as um there's an action limit on

01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,480
size

01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:06,960
so you can run our time so

01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,719
you can run 20 jobs you could also run

01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,799
72 hours

01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,799
to run an action uh keep in mind you

01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:16,560
only get 2 000 minutes in the limit

01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:16,560
so 72 hours being

01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:24,000
what is it uh

01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:24,000
24 hours times 60 minutes

01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,839
24 times 60.

01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,040
okay i'm typing in the chat that's why

01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:38,799
it's not working

01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:41,359
okay 24 times 60. 1400

01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:42,799
yeah so if you ran this for one day uh

01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:44,560
you would definitely hit your

01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:46,319
your minute limit uh so you want to keep

01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,440
that in mind but if you were paying for

01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,159
minutes you could actually run out for

01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:51,600
up to three guys um but yeah so running

01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:52,480
separate jobs so sometimes i have

01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,719
actions that trigger

01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,000
other jobs as well and you can do that

01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,960
as well for you to do it based on the

01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,280
job id

01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,480
so the answer is yeah there is a reason

01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,320
to run that many

01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,040
um especially if you're doing some heavy

01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,040
orchestration

01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,960
i'm trying to find uh the link to this

01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,280
action that was

01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:17,120
the other limit which is size limit

01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:21,760
there's actually a max size

01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:25,040
of 800 800 kbs um

01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:27,840
there we go so this action has hit

01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:30,159
our our size limit so this is a full

01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:33,600
stack ruby server edition

01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:36,320
uh you can see this action

01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,120
is running on multiple versions of ruby

01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,320
uh which is

01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:42,640
also the reason i actually um

01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,000
yeah you get a thousand extra minutes

01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,840
and then if you're an enterprise

01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,199
or if you're paid tier or not i think

01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,560
there's like negotiation or something

01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:50,400
like that that happens

01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,159
again i'm not i don't do sales so i'm

01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,840
not really sure what the deal is

01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,800
on that um but yeah not only they're

01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,920
running different versions they're

01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,199
running different

01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,199
flavors of of linux

01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:03,120
but if i can get to the bottom of this

01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:06,239
it is like 36 000

01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:09,360
no 12 000 lines of of co

01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:12,960
of yaml to make this run um

01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:15,120
so they're running on legitimately

01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,320
separate jobs uh and they have a reason

01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,040
and it's really because they're doing

01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,520
devops

01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,159
um so yeah this thing's absolutely

01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,520
insane

01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:24,080
uh if you want to get a closer look to

01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,120
this um there you go i'll drop it in

01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,159
the chat as well um but yeah there are

01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,360
there are reasons and there are people

01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:32,080
who want to do some pretty

01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,360
amazing things and get of actions uh

01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,880
this is like um

01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,000
there's also the idea of artifacts too

01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,199
as well so they're actually taking

01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,199
they're storing

01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,120
the output of their actions and storing

01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:44,400
them into

01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:45,920
a artifact which i don't have time to

01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,280
get into but just note that these that's

01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,040
a thing that you could do

01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,960
i did record a whole video on that and i

01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,640
haven't even published it yet but um

01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,320
i keep pointing to this video series get

01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,320
action traction um

01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,360
for those who are curious of what i keep

01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,159
pointing to

01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,600
um but yeah what is the other question

01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,800
can you explain real quick how actions

01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,480
are executed do they just fire

01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,400
automatically after creation or do you

01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:08,960
have to set them up and enable as such

01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,440
yeah so they are already enabled in your

01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,080
repo

01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,520
by default now if you forked if you

01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,080
forked this repo and their actions

01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,760
running

01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,920
you have to actually actively enable

01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,480
them uh that's a security thing as well

01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,120
um we don't want you to be able to fork

01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,120
a repo

01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,960
and then like run a bitcoin miner

01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,640
without knowing um

01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,920
that's a very specific use case but like

01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,400
it's a use case that actually has

01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,280
happened

01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:32,640
so for that reason we want you to be

01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,840
able to um

01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:38,080
enable actions on forks now inside your

01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,239
actions as well you can actually run

01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:43,040
uh you can actually turn these off so if

01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:45,520
you only want actions to run

01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,960
uh self-hosted runners if you only want

01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,400
actions to if you want to disable

01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,120
actions if you want to latch local

01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,679
actions

01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,800
so local actions being the action that i

01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,320
wrote

01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:57,760
directly in this repo is a local action

01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,280
so if you only want actions to run

01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,250
directly within their repo

01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,800
then you can turn that off as well

01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:06,000
[Music]

01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:09,280
you can allow selected actions as well

01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,400
so if i only wanted to run full stack

01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,920
ruby whatever or whatever it's called i

01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,000
need it as well

01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,199
um and then you can also set up the

01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,679
artifact

01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:22,239
log retention we can set up the log

01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:27,360
retention so my logs themselves

01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:27,360
i think i had one here that

01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,880
could have logs let's see a successful

01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,960
one

01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,400
uh i can take logs and actually create

01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,840
artifacts you know

01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,760
i'm gonna bounce around a bit too so

01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,840
context uh have you mentioned

01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,880
how self-hosted actions work i have not

01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,400
mentioned that

01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:48,560
and i wasn't planning on it um

01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,440
but self-hosted actions run based on

01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,840
like your

01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,560
url um so you host that and you provide

01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,600
that url

01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,280
into um to your repo

01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,800
i did want to point out that i do have a

01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,080
lighthouse action that is using

01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,760
because i keep bringing up artifacts so

01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:07,760
i might as well show it

01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,760
let me see if i can get this to open

01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,600
um where's my audit

01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,880
so i'm running this is really uh this

01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,960
might be overkill and normally needed

01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,719
uh but i do have an artifact oh this one

01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,679
failed

01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,960
ah this all right so i was it looks like

01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,000
this is broken so

01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,760
this should get fixed um

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,760
but i am running lighthouse and then

01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:35,360
providing a white house link

01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:38,800
to report to store as an artifact um

01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:42,719
it looks like my artifact failed itself

01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:45,600
um so the context of

01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,600
i think it's this one

01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,679
my white house score okay looks like

01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,600
everything's failing all right so

01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,960
something for me to fix later but um i

01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,120
was storing a link to the lighthouse

01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,360
report directly inside the action run

01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,560
workflow this is really just to prove a

01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:03,360
point and to

01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,719
to walk through a example in a previous

01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,600
um

01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:08,400
uh session um but yeah i was not

01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,920
planning on

01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,840
yeah it looks like all my artifacts are

01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,960
not uploading but you can also set

01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,080
retention how long you want the

01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,679
artifacts to be here

01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:18,960
um for self-hosted runners um

01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:22,239
yeah it's also going to be here in

01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:26,080
actions settings

01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:28,560
and you should be able to configure

01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,400
add a runner here and then you could run

01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,480
that in your container

01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,440
or azure devops or whatnot you could do

01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,199
that here so

01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,560
that's how it works uh and then once

01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:39,600
that's set up then it will run

01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:43,120
but i don't want to

01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,120
run a self-hosted runner

01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,280
all right um yeah there's some pretty

01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,920
good instructions on that too as well

01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,280
you mentioned

01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,520
yeah question what is the difference

01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,000
between github azure devops oh github

01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,000
and azure

01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,159
devops do they have the same features

01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,679
i've literally never used azure data so

01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:59,760
i'd be the worst person to ask that

01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:01,120
um but perhaps somebody else in the chat

01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,920
in the hangouts couldn't answer that

01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:06,000
question

01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:09,040
um i would say tfs

01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,560
or vs t what is the i don't know what

01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,480
that version control system is but

01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:16,480
probably that's the biggest difference

01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:21,840
um i don't know if tfs

01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:21,840
does tfs work in github

01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,320
it has that this is a confused cfs user

01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:32,080
trying to understand github may 23rd

01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:33,440
um yeah i don't think

01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,120
there are some plugins i guess you could

01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:39,280
make to

01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:42,400
get tfs but yeah um that convert git

01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:44,159
sorry convert tfs to get um

01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,920
excellent i use added devops yeah i

01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,280
don't i don't have a specific like

01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:51,840
um apples apples comparison

01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:53,600
uh mainly because i never use it uh tfs

01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,080
is the foundation oh you specify you

01:16:53,600 --> 01:17:00,400
want to devops either tfs or get

01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:02,400
got got it yeah so yeah

01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,920
looks like jeremy jeremy has the answers

01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,159
uh is it better to make a separate repo

01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,679
a separate branch for actions well

01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:10,080
the answer mostly depends on context

01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:13,040
just asking yeah

01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,600
it depends on your workflow so me at

01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,920
github

01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,600
and i wish i could open up a github repo

01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,640
sorry a github

01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,239
org repo we have limitations of what you

01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,000
can do at github because we use github

01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:25,679
enterprise so i can't just arbitrarily

01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,239
write whatever code i want and run

01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:31,360
actions directly inside of my code base

01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:35,199
if it's hosted on github's org um

01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:36,960
so there are not a ton of limitations

01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,679
but we do run a lot of audits on our

01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,880
code

01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:41,199
uh through things like code like

01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,280
security lab and code ql um

01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:45,440
so we can figure out we have some bad

01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,719
code that's actually running actions

01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,640
but it's really around preference and

01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:52,159
how you want to organize code like

01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:55,199
it's it's the tune of opinions um

01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:55,199
yeah yeah what is it um

01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,800
anyway there's no framework for how you

01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:03,360
should um you should write your actions

01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,120
i personally i write all my actions in

01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,560
separate repos because i do a lot of

01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,320
talking about actions so it's much

01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,320
easier for me to point to

01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,760
things like take action as a separate

01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,239
repo

01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,120
so that way i can provide context on

01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:18,320
this is a thing

01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:19,840
it's hosted on marketplace this is how

01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,760
you do it you can view it on marketplace

01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,520
which i didn't even get to

01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,800
as well but yeah this is my action

01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,480
hosted on the marketplace

01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,640
i can also see a bunch of other actions

01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:30,239
here that are all all separate repos

01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,239
so yeah if your context if you want to

01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:35,040
share actions uh

01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:36,480
with other folks and other orgs or other

01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,520
teams like this is going to be a better

01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,920
way to go

01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,199
if like myself i have an action that's

01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,280
running on a docker

01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:46,080
file directly in the repo that it's

01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:49,920
using you could also do that

01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:51,600
i would also say that babel

01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,159
and i use them because they're top of

01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,000
mind they have a folder

01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:57,840
of actions and they just point it

01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,760
directly to this one folder so all their

01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,960
actions for the entire babel org

01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,600
live right here so it's a preference

01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:06,480
thing

01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,360
um so and yeah it's between you and your

01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,840
team or

01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,679
if you run the team then it's like it is

01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,840
exactly whatever you you would like

01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,960
all right so we kind of went around

01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,000
about way because i was

01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:22,159
half explaining how

01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,960
the auto merge action works outer

01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:25,120
approve and merge

01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,640
but yeah these are secret steps the

01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:29,600
previous one has to pass for it

01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,400
uh for it to complete or else this one

01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,320
will not run

01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:36,000
it gets skipped uh so that's how that

01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:38,880
works uh i do have an action that is

01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,640
in the context of i think as close to

01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:44,480
one tab that i wanted

01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:46,159
oh you know it's no this is not it

01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,239
sorry and uh feel free to slow me down

01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:53,360
if you have

01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:53,360
all right here we are again

01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:02,480
all right for the sake of uh context

01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:04,000
i guess i probably ended up just uh

01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,320
is it all sessions i wonder yeah i

01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,760
wonder um

01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:11,040
yeah what might be happening but i guess

01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,840
we could

01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,719
we could speculate but i'm gonna drop in

01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,679
links to the

01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,000
the slides and the repo again in case

01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:22,400
folks

01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,400
have lost all contacts

01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:30,719
and i was answering a question

01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,719
or was i rambling about something

01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,840
and

01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:43,280
cool but i i think what i'll probably

01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,679
just end up

01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,719
because like we roughly have 10 minutes

01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:49,760
left on the

01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:52,880
the schedule um

01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,600
i share my screen again and um i'll just

01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,800
round up

01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:59,679
the the conversation just by saying the

01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,080
actions are there they're a pretty

01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:01,920
powerful

01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:04,000
feature um there's a lot of things you

01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,600
can do with them i think if you are

01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,080
excited about things like automating

01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,520
things that are either redundant or

01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,440
things you do all the time

01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,120
like there's so much opportunity for for

01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:15,280
github actions and sort of improving

01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,960
your workflow so i'm hoping that

01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,320
me the showing and sort of clicking

01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,600
around in a roundabout way of giving

01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:22,880
context to

01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:26,000
how i use actions and leverage them um

01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,040
hopefully been insightful um and at

01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,760
least

01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,880
sort of started getting your your brain

01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,639
uh

01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,239
in the getting the context of like what

01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:37,120
actions can um

01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:37,440
benefit for you um i will say that again

01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,320
the

01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:41,679
the the content itself like not knowing

01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,199
how the structure was going to be and i

01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:44,639
did this once before early this year and

01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:46,480
it went really well

01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:48,159
um well we didn't have any sort of

01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:51,600
interruptions in the middle but

01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:54,000
uh because i know the online pacing for

01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,679
workshops it's very challenging to

01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,159
uh bring people along for the ride the

01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:01,280
entire time as well keep it engaging

01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:03,440
so the intention was really

01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,639
share the repo so that way if you don't

01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,080
if you don't get anything else from this

01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:07,840
conversation at least you have the repo

01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,520
where you can learn actions on your own

01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,679
uh and the slides really just provided

01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,639
context on my story and how i use

01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:15,679
actions and

01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:18,639
how i basically share it with others

01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:19,440
um the other thing is that we never got

01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:23,440
past step

01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:25,440
uh one um in the conversation but

01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,199
the i wanted to talk about how you auto

01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,560
merge actions i use this action this

01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:31,280
whole setup right here

01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,239
um for not the setup but um the auto

01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,159
approve

01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:36,080
setup for things like the bend bot i

01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:39,199
actually auto merge my dependebot

01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:40,320
prs as well using this exact structure

01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:42,239
which you can check into open source

01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,679
repo how that works

01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:45,440
um if you don't know the open source

01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:48,880
repo open source i think it's

01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:52,480
i think i own the seo and sauced open

01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:53,600
um but anyway but the one thing i did

01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,760
want to mention too as well

01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,960
is the the second part of the part two

01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:00,080
of the workshop is

01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:02,000
leveraging actions in a very novel use

01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,840
case too as well which is mad libs which

01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,440
is kind of silly but um

01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,040
what i really want to do is i wanted to

01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,719
be able to validate things like issue

01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,080
templates which we were using for my

01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:12,080
team for the longest time

01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:14,159
uh this exact action this variables and

01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:17,280
markdown where i would

01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:18,000
create a template for folks and you open

01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,080
up the issue

01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,840
using the issue template and then what

01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,040
happens is all the information you fill

01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,960
in and the notes

01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,480
it actually populates the rest of the

01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,880
copy for the issue

01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,600
and this is really around there's a lot

01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,159
of people open

01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,880
issues on my team's repo who are not on

01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,320
my team

01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,080
and i don't expect them to have all the

01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:39,360
context about my team

01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:40,080
so what i try to do simply is this open

01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,159
issue

01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,760
you tell me four things and those four

01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:46,639
things will be populated throughout

01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,080
the comment structure of the issue so

01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:50,800
that way everybody else on the on my

01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:52,239
team can navigate the issue properly so

01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,760
imagine things like

01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:56,560
asking questions on um like what device

01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,360
you're using

01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,239
what browser are you using um where the

01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,080
bug occurred

01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:04,000
and how to reproduce it like this

01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:06,239
answering those questions and links

01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,360
um are getting people to open up stack

01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,520
overflow questions

01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,040
first before opening up issues it's a

01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,400
it's a nice way to basically have like a

01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,920
template system so

01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:16,320
this actually will walk you through

01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,679
creating a a mad lib

01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,360
if you aren't familiar with mad lib mad

01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:20,960
libs are um

01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,880
these puzzles where you just add in

01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,480
words are verbs and adjectives

01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,560
and it gives you a funny story so that's

01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:28,159
what this this does is you just add a

01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,320
bunch of words and adjectives

01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,920
and it gives you a funny story so that's

01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,120
how that works uh definitely check it

01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,400
out um

01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,480
feel free to pick it apart copy and

01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:38,239
paste fork do what you'd like

01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,840
and then finally the last part of this

01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,520
is is ci and i

01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,520
i purposely put this as the third part

01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:45,600
because most people think of actions

01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,520
as ci but i wanted to give other use

01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:48,560
cases of how you can use actions that

01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,040
are not just

01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,480
running your node test but this will it

01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:55,840
will run your node test

01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:58,719
um i go through an example where

01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:00,159
i have a for that same issue i mentioned

01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,360
in the first session i created an issue

01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:04,080
for my team to

01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:05,360
do stand-up um we the way we do this is

01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:08,400
we actually have a week number

01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:10,320
that we put in the title of the issue

01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:12,080
and this is a bit of code snippets to

01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,840
actually see how that works

01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,440
it's it's not a lot of code it's like

01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,000
having 10 lines of code

01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:19,520
um but we run we run tests using that so

01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,120
i wrote some tests

01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,280
you actually copy and paste some tests

01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,960
and get 200 cut test coverage

01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,040
which is not possible because 200

01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,639
percent so two times zero is zero

01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,239
percent but anyway it doesn't matter

01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:32,080
um you had zero tests and now you have

01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:33,600
two tests um

01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,120
and then i talk about this other thing

01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,000
which is uh adding lint

01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:39,120
linting to your code so a lot of times

01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,520
we have specific ways

01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:43,120
to write code things like prettier and

01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,600
things like um

01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,320
eslint like you could use on the command

01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,880
line

01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:50,400
but i always i avoid that because i have

01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,239
open source project that has that

01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,600
takes contributions from all different

01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:56,960
walks of life and

01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,239
and skill set and i want to i want to

01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,600
remove that friction

01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:01,520
that you don't have to use things like

01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,280
husky or those those uh

01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,520
formatter tools that prevent you from

01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,040
committing without fixing the code

01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,560
like i want you to ship your code and

01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:11,360
then i'll be able to

01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:13,440
um focus on that but feel free to walk

01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:16,639
through that also the last part is

01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,639
part four where you could um

01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,239
you can see a bunch of examples of

01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,679
actions so

01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:24,719
that is pretty much it uh i appreciate

01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,239
you coming through

01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,159
i believe we only go to for another

01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,960
three minutes uh and we can make room

01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:31,199
for the next

01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,520
uh speaker or the setup and have a

01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:37,760
conversation or less next workshop lead

01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:40,719
um i you can find me on twitter

01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:42,000
uh which is bw on twitter feel free to

01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:44,560
ask me questions

01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,320
um i am happy to answer actions

01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,400
questions and have a conversation

01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,600
you'd also find my github and other

01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:53,679
links as well

01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,280
there so thanks everybody thank you all

01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:58,159
to david's thank you jeremy

01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,880
very much for uh for sticking around and

01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:02,560
hanging out

01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:05,440
and uh yeah definitely uh

01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:07,760
stay in touch i guess this is it's been

01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,760
a ride

01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:15,120
and then i believe just for context i

01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,719
will drop in the link to the uh

01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:20,880
the workshop one last time in case you

01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:20,880
didn't get it maybe you jumped in late

01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,480
excellent

01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,760
cool yeah i wonder if it was i don't

01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:39,760
know if uh

01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:41,040
the all things open staff was open but i

01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,880
guess my

01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,960
my speculation is perhaps maybe someone

01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,960
else was joining the call at the same

01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,120
time

01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,560
and uh maybe kicked out the rest of the

01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:52,639
participants

01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,719
i know sometimes also i sometimes hit

01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:56,960
the big fat and for all attendees

01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,239
button instead of leave um so that's

01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,880
also possible but

01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:02,400
you know it is what it is uh i'll stop

01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:05,120
sharing my screen

01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:07,120
and i'll make room for others the chat

01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,800
but yeah this was uh

01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:12,840
this was fun it was nice to see all the

01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:15,840
people uh appreciating the talk too as

01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,840
well

01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,800
