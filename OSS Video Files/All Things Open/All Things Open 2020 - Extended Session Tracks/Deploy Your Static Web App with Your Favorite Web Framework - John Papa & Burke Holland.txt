Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Extended Sessions Tracks

Abstract: You've built an app and you want it to scale. Do you want CI/CD, custom domains, SSL certificates, APIs, global scale of your static assets, authentication, and authorization? And whether your favorite web framework is Svelte, Vue, React, Angular or something else entirely, you'll learn how to build a static web app on Azure and go from GitHub repo to global scale.

welcome everybody to

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,840
our workshop on deploying static web

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,519
apps to the cloud and

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,880
we're super excited to share this with

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,719
you today uh

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,640
i'll be repeating this again but just

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,960
let people know we have myself and burke

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,880
holland will be walking step by step

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,720
through the workshop with you doing

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,119
exactly what you're doing

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,240
but then also in the chat because it's

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,080
hard to do this

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,160
and answer chat at the same time we have

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,760
craig shoemaker one of our colleagues

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,160
who helped write a lot of the

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,760
documentation for static web apps

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,520
so he knows this product probably better

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,559
than most people do i mean better than

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,840
brooke and i

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,600
and he's going to help answer your

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,160
questions in the chat while we're going

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,480
along

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,879
so please feel free to fire those away

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,120
and craig will handle those

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,800
so to kick things off i'm john papa you

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,079
can find me after this session

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,320
at john underscore papa up on twitter

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,600
my other colleague here is burke holland

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,920
and you can find him

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,440
up on twitter at burke holland and you

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
can find craig shoemaker

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,040
at craigsshoemaker on twitter or you can

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,640
just find him in the chat

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
for the next 45 minutes as well

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,400
so what are you going to do today that's

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,320
the big question so the way this is

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,520
gonna work is i'm gonna walk through

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,479
as the storyteller the teacher and burke

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,759
is going to go through step by step

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,360
through the entire

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,799
uh what we call learn module which is

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,600
our workshop hands-on just like you are

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,759
so we'd like you

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
and burke to go through this together in

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
the experience

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,960
you're going to get your app and your

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,960
choice of your web framework

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,840
we have four for you to choose from vue

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,600
react angular and

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,759
you're going to create and deploy an

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,799
azure static web app

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,479
you're going to add something called a

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
fallback route which will explain what

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,840
that is as we go through there

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,840
but quickly that's just to handle

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,360
client-side routes

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
and finally you're going to learn how to

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,280
change your ci cd

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,600
workflow well there's one more thing

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,040
actually it's honestly just to have fun

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,399
because we like to have fun when we do

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,680
this kind of stuff so we hope you do too

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,160
this is the app that you're going to be

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,920
building and why we're going to be doing

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,440
this is because we all start with code

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,280
and if you just saw the presentation

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,879
this is just a quick rehash of

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
what we're going to get out of this

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,520
we're going to have our code we're going

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
to push it to github

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,720
we're going to use ci cd with github

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,200
actions so we can build

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,120
and deploy our apps we're going to have

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,400
azure functions apis optionally and

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
we'll see how you can

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,360
omit those if you don't want them you

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,200
can also route requests from your app

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,959
to your api that's going to

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,440
automatically do this for you with azure

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,040
static web apps

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,879
we are automatically going to get a

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,480
domain with our application with an ssl

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,599
certificate

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,280
we're not going to set up a custom

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,959
domain today because you'd all have to

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
go buy one and connect it but

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,000
we can show you where that happens and

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
then

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,959
also you can get authentication and

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,720
authorization with your application

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,879
and global scale which you get out of

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,959
the box by basically all of the

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,000
sites that you deploy you deploy one

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,599
site today and

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,040
everybody's going to deploy one

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,319
everything gets deployed is going to be

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,000
around the world

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,080
uh at the edge so people in different

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,920
regions the world get the fastest access

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,680
that they can get

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,599
so all that's getting there through

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,560
azure static web apps and again you can

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,000
choose angular

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,440
or react or svelte or view

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,560
you could choose other frameworks as

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,120
well but we're going to give you the

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,040
code

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,560
for a fully functioning app with one of

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,519
these four frameworks today so you can

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,519
pick which one you want

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,840
and then we're going to show how you can

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,599
use npm run build to build the assets

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,599
and it's going to create these static

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,440
files which are in javascript

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,440
html and css the three amigos of the web

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,239
and it's going to create these files by

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,319
running the build process for us

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,519
while it's deploying so what ends up up

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,480
on azure

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,760
is going to be your running application

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,120
and that's just going to light up our

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,560
app

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,599
the static web apps is what we're going

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,480
to build and that's what we're going to

00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,680
get today

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,239
and effectively we're going to get that

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,159
built-in host of our static web apps

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,080
up in uh storage it's called azure

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,000
storage right at the edge so we can use

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,879
it like a cdn global scale around the

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,720
world

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,720
we could optionally add authentication

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,720
authorization and apis

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,920
and then we're always going to get cicd

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,920
with our github actions

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,359
so here's a quick diagram of how this

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,120
works when we start

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,639
the learn module workshop in just a

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,600
moment you're going to point

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,680
your code your azure static web app at

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
your code which is kind of a folder

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,120
in this case it might be called app on

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,240
the screen but it might be

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,160
view app or spelt app and then we're

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
going to push that up to github

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
make our changes to it it'll fire off

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,000
the cicd process which is a github

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,280
action which will then deploy the

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,560
application which is our static content

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,000
and it's going to then make it globally

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,680
available to everybody so once you're

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,479
done with this workshop in the next 45

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,320
minutes

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,280
the app that you have will be accessible

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,720
by everybody else

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,880
so effectively we're going to publish

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,600
the publish the app of azure static web

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
apps

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,160
from github we'll get our global scale

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
and we'll get our custom domain we'll

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,639
show how we can set up custom domains

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,560
and we get all those different fancy

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,360
things that we just talked about

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,440
and all that comes with azure static web

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,880
apps

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,280
so as a reminder today you're going to

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
get to pick which one of these you want

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
to choose from

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
now the applications might look

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,880
different to you so if you choose a

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
different one that we choose the only

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,240
difference is the colors

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,080
and then the logo on the upper left hand

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,800
corner that's just to differentiate

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,440
those

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,720
but the apps actually run the same thing

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,759
now here's the most important part of

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,639
the workshop

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,320
go to this link you can go there now

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,840
this link and we'll maybe craig you can

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,880
pop it into the chat again we'll keep

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,039
popping it in there

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
and you'll see it on the next few slides

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,560
this is the workshop that we're going to

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,080
be going through together so maybe burke

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,639
you can start by jumping over to that

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,680
link as well

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,919
and then we're gonna have a quick

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
exercise on how to use

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,560
microsoft learn so you might be

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,560
wondering because we had some questions

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,720
in the last session

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,080
do i need an azure account to do this

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,600
yes you do

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,759
but the good news is when you go through

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,800
this workshop it gives you one for free

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,000
automatically

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
you don't have to sign up with a credit

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,199
card or anything else like that it just

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,759
gives you a free

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,199
access to what we call sandbox to azure

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,880
so you can try all this

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,240
yourself and to do this

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
we're going to go to learn that's the

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,520
link right here on the right so go there

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
now if you'd like to

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,479
you're going to click sign in in the

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,160
upper right now this is probably the

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,280
hardest piece of this

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,639
because you're not going to sign in with

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,880
your normal email address you're going

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,319
to click a little link below the sign

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,199
in button and brooke's going to show you

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,520
this it's called the sign in options

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,199
why because then it's going to allow us

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,479
to sign in with github

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,639
we want you to sign with your github

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,520
account because that's the easiest way

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,800
to get into this and then we're just

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,039
going to follow the prompts and do it

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,960
together

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,039
so to kick things off this is the

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,400
exercise we're going to go to

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,000
we'll be walking through this together

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,280
with burke in just a moment but just

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,759
giving an idea what's going to happen

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,440
you're going to pick your version of

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,400
angular reacts filter view

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,319
it's going to lead you to this

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,960
repository which will basically copy all

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,800
the code to your github organization

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
and if you want to follow exactly as we

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,919
do just call your

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,680
repo my static web app that'll be the

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,319
same name but if you change the name

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
it's okay

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,080
just have to use your version of the

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,840
name

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
so with that you can just click on this

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,120
link this link also brings you to the

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,800
same place

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
and we're only going to do the exercises

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,319
here today burke

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,080
so we'll kind of sweep through some of

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,319
the

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,680
the verbiage on the pages straight

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,160
straight to the good stuff

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,919
yeah so with that burke why don't i stop

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,759
sharing and we go to your screen and

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,599
everybody can start the workshop

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,080
together sounds good let me see if i can

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,639

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,520
yeah i sure can alright so let me give

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,240
you

00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:01,680
uh let me see here

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,199
it's not letting me oh it wants me to

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,840
hold on i've got a wants me to grant

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,560
zoom permission in my security

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,360
preferences

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,199
yes we must grant zoom permission to see

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,800
the almighty burke holland

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:21,520

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,879
it often asks you but you don't you just

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,199
have to say okay and it just lets you go

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,800
sometimes oh does it let's see here

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,400
give it a shot now it def definitely

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,599
wants me to do it so give me a second

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,039
here

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,560
while i try to tweak in the meantime

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,880
uh for those of you check out the link

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,159

going to see the learn module

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,680
which it'll say at the top of it publish

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,080
an angular react svelt or review

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,040
javascript app with azure static web

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,800
apps that's the title

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,320
yeah it's not letting me in i may have

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,600
to quit zoom here

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,560
and join again uh if that's okay i will

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,839
be right back

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,640
sure we'll see you in just a minute

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,839
burke so i'll answer some questions

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
while we're kind of getting ready for

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
this

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,080
what's the advantage of using azure

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,720
static web apps opposed to azure app

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,720
service

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,920
is static web apps cheaper that's a

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
great question so there's a lot of

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,839
different reasons

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,760
azure app service is a full server so if

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,760
you want to bring your own node express

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,360
code or asp.net

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,279
and you want to set up your own global

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,920
scale and your own ssl

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,200
and you want to set up your own cdn if

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,640
you want to set up azure functions

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,640
separately and then connect it with

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,680
cores or reverse proxy

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,480
yes you can use azure app service it's a

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,200
different

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,680
service so basically azure app service

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
is like

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,880
taking a server that you normally have

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,320
on premise or in your company and

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,080
putting it up in the cloud

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,080
and using it the way you want to build

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
it but you have to do all that stuff

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,839
yourself

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,600
with azure static web apps you don't

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,680
have a server effectively think of this

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,640
as serverless for your web app and your

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,000
functions

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,680
where you get all the things i just

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,040
mentioned but it's just hosted in the

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,640
cloud

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,240
and today right now the preview is free

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,560
so everything with azure static web apps

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,680
is far cheaper because it's free

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,519
to do this and they're still figuring

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,040
out what the pricing model might be

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,959
and i can't speak to that until it's

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,880
actually released at ga which is

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,360
effectively the full release

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,920
uh for it but i expect there will be a

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,560
free

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,279
version if if i have my wishes and

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,279
dreams come true

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,040
all right i'm back did you miss me hey

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,000
burke we missed you so much

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,920
good well i have good news and bad news

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,519
the good news is i'm back

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,640
the bad news is zoom still

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,680
cannot connect to share my screen and i

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,279
don't know

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,200
what to do about it besides maybe

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,440
restart

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,640
um i don't know what happened some sort

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,160
of update to my mac

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,839
what's it telling you oh it says

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,519
basically everything is grayed out it's

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,800
saying system preference is unknown

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,800
unknown everything's unknown

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,600
that's not good yeah that's pretty bad

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,079
um so we can try that if you want to

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,360
maybe get started while i try to fix

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
this and maybe i'll be back in five

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,079
minutes

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,560
i'll share my screen in the meantime all

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,680
right the joys of a live demo folks

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,560
at least you don't have to watch me fix

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,560
this i'll be back

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,000
all right so let's make sure can i get a

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,320
quick thumbs up craig uh gregor burke if

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,200
i

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,200
am visible you guys see my screen

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,880
all right i got a thumbs up there cool

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,399
so let me put the chat up too because

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,959
then i can kind of see the chat as we're

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,959
going through it

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,079
all right folks so we're going to try

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,360
this a little different we're working

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,680
share in a minute we'll go ahead and

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,200
we'll

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,600
switch over to him so on page one

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,440
of this page here the first thing you'll

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,440
have to do is you'll have to

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,880
log in if you haven't signed in yet now

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,920
i'm signed in but i'm going to show you

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
how this works

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,600
you'll see in the upper right hand

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,480
corner there's a icon of a user

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,760
a couple circles if i click on that

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,920
you'll see i'm logged in with my

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,320
microsoft email

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,040
if you're not you'll see a sign in

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,200
button

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,800
and then that sign in button you'll want

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,079
to click on after it

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,320

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,200
sign in options right below it

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,639
and then choose github as your github

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
account

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,240
once you do that you can get back to

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,360
this page and then everything will just

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,320

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,079
format is you have your learning

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,199
objectives and your prereqs

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,440
we know the learning objectives we're

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,839
going to deploy the app

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,760
down below the prereqs you've got to be

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
familiar with angular reacts filter view

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,800
which

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,000
i say familiar if you don't know what

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,800
they are then you're probably in the

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,800
wrong place right

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,519
well maybe maybe

00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,079
[Laughter]

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,120
but you're jquery do you have a is there

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,720
a jquery option

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,279
what about the jquery option we should

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320
add that with the hello world repo there

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,959
is

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,160
okay cool uh second is if you can do

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,720
this locally you're going to want

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,920
node with get you want to click on that

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
link real quick and show people what

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,360
that means

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,760
this one here yeah okay

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,279
so on this page you choose the lts

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,160
version of node if you haven't already

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,240
installed it

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,519
lts stands for long term support it's

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,800
basically the

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,920
version of node that everybody

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,839
recommends that you use in production

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,680
uh and burke i assume you already have

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,680
that i do

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:59,240
you know what i can verify that here

00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:02,480
let's let's

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,760
12.18.3 oh i'm a little behind

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,000
but i'm not going to upgrade it that's

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,040
okay if you're darn close if you got 12

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,440
you're good

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,480
close enough uh a github account because

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,760
we're going to use github do you have a

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,279
github account burke

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,839
i do i'm signed in with my github

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,480
account and visual studio code the best

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,360
editor

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,680
ever that's right enough said

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,800
and then down below these are the eight

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
steps if you will

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,800
you call these units these are the eight

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,399
units in the learning experience

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,240
one thing you'll notice is that any unit

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,920
that begins the word exercise is

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,079
actually hands on and there are only

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,600
three of these

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,279
so why don't we just go step by step

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,000
through each one of these

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,639
and click on introduction first oh

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,160
that's right

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,680
first exercise i skipped over

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,279
that's okay and if you do go to the

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,000
wrong one like see how burk is on unit

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,759
two of eight

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,279
bur could you select the drop down for

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,279
unit two of eight

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,959
you can always go to a different unit

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,320
right from this menu so

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,079
if we went back to introduction just to

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,360
show them how to do it

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,959
you can click an introduction right

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,560
there and it would bring over to the

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,000
first page which basically just explains

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,040
what an azure static web app is all

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,959
right so now we're on the

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,720
unit two which is exercise yep

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,959
burke what are you gonna use i don't

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,959
know let's let's crowdsource it

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,560
what do you what do you want me to use

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,399
type into the chat which

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,600
framework of these four you want burke

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,399
to use

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,040
see one for angular one for react view

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,560
react

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,160
super angular two for react whoa whoa

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,360
whoa whoa i can't keep up

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,839
i'm seeing a lot of angular a lot of

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,839
react view angular view view

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
angular

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,480
you can only vote once folks oh man

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,440
you know what it's hard to say it's

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,839
either angular or react

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,199
well i'm going to give you a hint for

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,160
everybody out there if you're

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,360
if you don't care uh the one that takes

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,199
longer to build

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,040
will take longer to deploy because it's

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,720
got to run through mp and run build

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,279
i'll give you a hint that the longest

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,559
one to build is angular

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,439
and the shortest is svelt the other two

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,480
are in the middle

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,919
should we use felt

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:17,360
spelt wind up paul's like that's it

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,319
pearl debato yeah cgi

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,360
cgi bin php here we go and honestly it

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
doesn't matter which one you build

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,679
because we're not going to be playing

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,160
with the code much

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,079
so why don't we just do all right let's

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,720
use felt i've never done it with felt so

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,320
here we go

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,480
so the cool thing about this is once you

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,039
select that tool up the top uh your web

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,559
frameworks

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,080
the instructions on some of the pages

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,760
might change

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,200
so if there's something slightly

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,400
different like we learned in the work

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,240
the session before this

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,760
where we put the code for these

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,280
different apps might change so we'll

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,120
actually see

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,120
svelte show up on our app down below

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,240
okay burke first step create a

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,240
repository

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,840
navigate to the create page from the

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,080
template i can do that yeah

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,080
you can just always command click i just

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,480
command click by default on everything

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,480
now

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,640
i do too but that one there if you just

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,000
click it will open a new tab

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,000
oh shoot it's going to want me to sign

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,880
in with my

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,880
uh what why let me try that again

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,640
what's my profile here it's gmail

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,240
sign in to why do i have to authenticate

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,559
to

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,320
i get that now we work for microsoft

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,320
they want us to do that

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,600
pick an account i think i'm gonna have

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,120
to use my

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,919
microsoft account here okay i assume

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,360
so and this is where uh for folks at

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,080
home who are playing along with us you

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,080
will have to

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,919
use an account that has access to github

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,559
obviously uh-oh

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,520
don't go to my authentication app y'all

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,520
ignore that number

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,160
too late i beat you to it

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,600
write that down 52 keys to the kingdom

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,720
okay all right so could you zoom in on

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,480
your browser a little bit too

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,919
yeah tell me when to stop is that good

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,679
that is way too good okay

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
how about that a little better that

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,559
that's fantastic so i'm going to read

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,600
the instructions so we don't switch back

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,679
and forth

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,360
forward okay it basically says enter

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,240
your repositories my dash

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,240
stack static dash web dash app

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:33,360
yes

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:33,360
[Laughter]

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,880
okay somebody doesn't clean up his repos

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,720
oh it's a it's a dumpster fire in there

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,000
uh now the second thing it doesn't say

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,640
this and you don't have to do it

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,679
everybody

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,400
in the steps and i think i'm going to

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,799
add it just because i wrote this module

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,640
um i like to choose public because then

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,320
everybody can see your repo

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,760
um berkeley's public because then you

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,280
can see what he's doing

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,919
but you don't have to it could be a

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,360
private repo if you wanted to

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,360
and then it says click the big green

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,480
button

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,120
yay it's generating your app

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,360
looks promising now now it says open a

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,120
terminal on your computer

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,039
oh i can do that too you're gonna get

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,120
cloned this locally

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,200
okay let me up up the font size here

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,039
whoa whoa no we don't tell people is

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,799
put it in a folder that you like

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,200
everybody

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,640
all right so you want me to clone it yes

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,919
and there's a command on the learn

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,679
module for cloning it

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,960
oh copy it right i probably shouldn't be

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,919
going through the module

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,120
so let's clone here so let's just copy

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,159
this

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,120
i'm gonna copy it in and change your

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,120
username to

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,480
yep now because you called the repo

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,159
different two you'll have to change name

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,679
repo too yeah

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,000
we call it my static web application

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,080
that should be right if not it'll let us

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,840
know

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,720
next step is okay again this is on the

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,720
learn module so

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
cd

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,000
okay i'm there now the next step says to

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,280
cd into the svelt app now this is where

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,760
it will differ based on whether you

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,320
chose angular react view or cells

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,400
yeah in fact if we look at the folders

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,159
we can see

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,039
depending on which one you you got so

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,039
let's copy in

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,000
all right i'm there feeling good next

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,720
npm install

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,400
oh i know i know that not before by the

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,919
way one of the tricks you showed me john

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,159
when i first started here was that you

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,679
could just do this i didn't know that

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,080
i've been working with npm for like a

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,760
decade no yeah i love showing

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,640
eight years you know scott hanselman

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,880
says that you only get so many

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,730
keystrokes in your lifetime

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,200
that's a really morbid way to

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,039
[Laughter]

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
i mean i i get the sentiment but it's

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,559
kind of like you know every second

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,240
brings you one second closer to death

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,720
like could we talk about something else

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,880
all right all right and then the final

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,159
step is to run npm run

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,559
dev and you can copy that from step six

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,000
so what we've just done everybody is

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,400
burke and all of you

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,840
have created the repo in your own github

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,960
organization

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,600
you've cloned it locally you've run npm

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,679
install

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,200
in the folder so you get all your

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,960
dependencies and now we're just making

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,720
sure it works

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,080
so once you make sure it works then

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,760
burke it says to click

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,960
on localhost 5000 because yours is cells

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,360
does it actually say that up in a

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,440
browser yeah it does localhost 5000.

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,720
just checking your work here look at

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,760
that that is fast man

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,760
that's really fast so there

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,679
there's the app and it's happy and if

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,039
yours is a different port that's because

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,000
um you're running react view angular

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,080
so on or so forth yeah so some folks in

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,280
the chat are asking for the link to the

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,080
learn module i'm going to go ahead and

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,960
paste that in there

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,600
if i can grab it real quick because i

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,600
will text

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,440
craig's got it craig's way ahead of me

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,880
as always

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,480
so yep janet there you go so that was

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,240
exercise one uh let's look back to the

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,960
learn module

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,320
okay okay i can do oh it's right here

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,120
now at the bottom of the learn module

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,640
you'll see that

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,640
it's a picture of the svelte app if

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,320
yours is green that means you chose the

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,919
view app if yours is blue you chose the

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,799
react app and if it's red you chose the

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,240
angular app

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,990
if it's not one of these four colors

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,640
then i don't know what you did

00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:33,520
[Laughter]

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,520
pearl pearl there you go kobold.net

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,880
so at the very bottom then it says stop

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,440
running the app by

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,440
hitting control c control c okay

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,880
all right it's stopped

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,400
yep it's dead yep and we're getting a

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,840
question which we always get to

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,520
in the chat and craig might be answering

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,120
this there but i'll do it verbally too

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,360
because i get it a lot

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,240
um and craig says yes git comes with npm

00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,840
and node so

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,080
if you install node from the link that

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,600
we had in the prereqs which is on the

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,600
first page of the link for this learn

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,799
module when you install that it gives

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,919
you git

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,320
are you serious it just i did not know

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,240
that

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,679
i don't know how i feel about that it

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,279
also comes with a lot of things these

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,640
days like it even comes there's an older

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,480
version of it that comes with a mac too

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,679
it's just baked in already all right

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,279
let's hit the continue button

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,279
burke i know how to do that

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,200
now this is we said we're just going to

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,799
go through exercises so this is just

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,559
explaining what we're about to do

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,720
so we can just scroll through here and

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,840
look at the main headers

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,760
we're going to connect our github

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,520
instance to get our static web app to

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,799
github next

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,279
which means we're going to need to know

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,640
where's our app located

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,000
we don't have an api so we don't care

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,440
about that but we need to know where

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
does felt put its app

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,919
artifacts which is just a fancy word for

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,320
when svelte builds where does it put the

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,320
files

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,679
and then it's going to create this

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,039
github action

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,480
and we can skip the functions part

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,880
because we're not doing that in this one

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,159
it's just telling us what they are

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,799
oh nice okay all right okay

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,919
let's go to the second exercise which is

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,440
unit four

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,279
of eight rock and roll oh it's making me

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,120
a sandbox

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,960
yeah so right at the top of the page is

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,760
activate sandbox for all of you click

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,480
that button

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,000
and it will take like a minute to do

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,080
burke has one which is now available for

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,080
47 more minutes

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,679
yeah i was obviously i've used i was

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,039
doing this earlier today

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,440
yeah i think i think it's wait just a

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,960
minute to let yeah it's four hours we

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,360
should wait till it folks

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,159
let's give it like i think it takes

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,600
about a minute

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,200
yeah so it should take a minute it might

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
even ask you to give permissions to it

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,520
real quick

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,760
uh it's just i'm going to allow you to

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,840
use that sandbox

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,120
and then notice it still says svelte on

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,840
burke's screen because that's what he

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,240
chose before so remember is your

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,640
selection

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,640
nice

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,960
everybody was anybody able to get their

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,400
sandbox activated and let's see what

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,400
what the time looks like people still

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,919
waiting

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,440
it's got a couple of steps like you

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,679
create it and it's like review the

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,880
permissions and then it reloads

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,720
is that 50 for a couple folks okay yeah

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,640
it usually takes like a minute minute

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,279
and a half at most for me

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,000
i don't exactly know what sometimes it's

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,679
faster sometimes it's slower

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,840
i imagine somebody like burke is sitting

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,679
in the background in some server farm

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,200
grabbing a hard drive eating his grilled

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,919
cheese sandwich and goes oh

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,120
darn i gotta get up there and go yeah

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,320
there's a text message

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,159
someone needs a sandbox turn it on

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,799
there's a beeper

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,480
yeah goes off well the nice thing is

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,760
once you get it created it comes back

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,960
really quickly

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,840
it's good for four hours all right i

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,200
like sandboxes

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,039
because you don't have to have an azure

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,240
account which a lot of people just don't

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,760
or they don't want to use their

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,279
corporate one and so it's just a great

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,760
way to explore it without having to sign

00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,760
up for anything

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:08,000
oh mcafee oh yeah i didn't

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,080
virus well the goods

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,679
the only reason we had you use node is

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,200
to run the app locally

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,279
if you don't want to worry about that if

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,279
you just want to

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,120
deploy the app through the cloud you

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,880
don't actually have to use node

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,200
node was only used for the step that we

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,399
just did

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
yeah we're not going to use it again

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,720
believe it or not yeah we're not going

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
to use it again so if you want to

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,760
continue

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,720
and deploy the after the cloud without

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,159
it that'll work too

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,240
although i really don't appreciate

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,760
mcafee with his

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,760
their over overbearing

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,440
stance on node virus just a little bit

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,720
alarmist square itself sometimes can

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,520
really be a

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,080
yeah it's like virus software is a virus

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,919
ooh

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:55,279
inception all right so let's look at the

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,279
next steps here what do we have to do

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,320
you're going to create a static web app

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,320
they want you to install this azure

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,760
static web app extension for vs code

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,960
okay let's let's let's do that

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,360
so that's the first step is installing

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,880
this

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,840
extension yes so go to the marketplace

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
okay

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,520
and here we are

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,480
and install

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:32,399
uh i got it continue

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,399
and wants to open it okay

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,720
oh and it opened it and opened my window

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,320
over here

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,840
that's fine i guess we haven't opened vs

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,320
code yet oh it just

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,480
opens it and it doesn't actually install

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,840
it it just takes you to it

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,799
and then i guess you gotta click install

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,960
again yeah it'll basically opens the

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,000
extension in vs code so then you can say

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,520
install

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,799
gotcha uh okay that was quick

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,600
installed it's like it's it's as if i

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,760
had it cached or something

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,200
so neil if you're seeing the message

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,640
i've seen this before the extension is

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
incompatible with your version of vs

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,039
code

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,799
it's likely your version of es code is

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,279
old you might need to

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,679
update can you show them where yep down

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,799
here on the bottom right we got a gear

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,840
and click on that and then um

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,399
and actually let me let me toggle

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,000
my sidebar sorry y'all i put mine on the

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,640
right we don't talk about that um

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,520
it's on the left for most of you this

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,360
probably looks better

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,200
yeah and just check for updates but you

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,760
actually should see a little number

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,399
on your wheel i think it's shouldn't say

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,080
like one

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,320
or so i think isn't that what we do for

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,480
updates you just click on that

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,240
um you can install the update yeah check

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,120
for updates and get it there what

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,520
happens is

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,279
long story short extensions can require

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,960
a certain version of vs code

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,640
and it looks like it may have required

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,520
one that yours is older than that

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,440
so berks is good to go let's go back to

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,640
the learn module and it says once you've

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,159
installed

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,520
that marketplace uh you might need to

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,120
reload now you didn't

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,640
get prompted for reload so you don't

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,600
have i did not get prompted

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,120
um but you may um over on the left-hand

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,600
side you should see it but if you see

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,640
three dots like some ellipses like this

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,919
it could be there

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,039
if you have a bunch of these it'll

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,320
collapse them so you can look here

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,919
the other thing that you can do is you

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,440
can just right click and make sure see

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,039
if it's in this menu here and if it's

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,919
not checked

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,919
put a check by it

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,320
yep so uh if you don't see the azure

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,120
symbol as burke is saying

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,840
make sure that if you see three dots

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,679
that's there

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,279
another way to look for that would be to

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,799
refresh

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,559
vs code can you show them how to do that

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,039
real quickly just type you're gonna

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:52,240
sorry so it's you're gonna do um f1

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:55,200
so f1 if you if your function keys are

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,240
functional if not command shift p on a

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,880
mac

00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,279
on on windows it's ctrl shift p like

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,399
this

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,799
and this gives you what's called the

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,360
command command palette

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,600
and then just look for reload and reload

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,799
window

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,799
it's like hitting refresh on your

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,600
browser sometimes that helps

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,600
load stuff up

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,320
cool all right so then the next thing we

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,640
have to do is sign into

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,039
uh azure so it says go to the command

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,039
palette

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,039
i'm here let me get i got rid of those

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,159
other ones so that it looks like

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,399
everybody else is here you can also

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,080
click

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,840
that button sign into azure by the way

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,120
so but it wants me to go let's let's do

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,679
it with the modules let me come back

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,399
here

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,600
yeah it says command palette signed view

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,360
command palette and

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,720
azure sign in so view command palette

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,880
azure sign in

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,559
and you might already be in burke but

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,120
they wouldn't no you know what i signed

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,080
out

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,960
this morning to make this magical i'm

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,640
gonna use this one

00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,360
which is what i signed in to learn with

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:03,840
this is my microsoft account

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,840
all done

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,000
we're there cool

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,600
so the next step is scrolling down now

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,039
you're going to go follow the prompts

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,519
which you did

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,919
open vs code and go to file open folder

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:24,960
to wherever you put your code

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,960
okay so file open folder

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,799
i don't have open folder

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,279
just do open yep okay

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,840
i'll take a note on that all right i'm

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,600
stitching web application

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,080
and just this whole the whole thing here

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,080
uh

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,080
i can't read it's too small but yes just

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,799
hit open right on that main thing

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,799
oh i wish i could make this bigger

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,200
yeah so i see all of the different apps

00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,600
in here in the different languages

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,200
even though i'm only using svelte yes

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,159
you should see them all

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,840
okay i do ah glad you found a way ellie

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,200
uh yeah the icon might be disappeared

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,799
another thing sometimes those icons

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,159
don't show up on on the left-hand side

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,760
unless you right-click

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,600
and you select them like if it's not

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,960
checked boxed burke can you show that

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,840
real quick

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,760
uh it's like azure icon on the left oh

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,440
yeah like if burke unchecks azure watch

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,720
what happens to it on the screen

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,600
it will disappear yeah so sometimes i

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,600
accidentally do this

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,559
all right so now the next thing is to go

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,399
to the azure button

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,559
clicked and then at the top

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,919
uh you've got to select your concierge

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,600
subscription which burke

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,360
you have yours there if you don't then

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,039
there's a step there to do it

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,039
uh and you're click click the big plus

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,240
button at the top work

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,240
we're going to create the static web

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,720
apps

00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,440
enter a name my second

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,279
static web app since my first one is

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,519
already there

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,519
way to prepare for the demo brooke all

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,119
right press enter

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:13,760
choose a branch main main sounds like a

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,760
better branch

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,079
and then which you're on number three of

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,839
six you're gonna choose svelte app this

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,679
is where you would choose view or react

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,399
app or whatever you all chose

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,599
for step four you can choose slash or

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,200
you can scroll to the bottom and choose

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,040
skip for now

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,159
which by the way i just made a pull

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,200
request to put that at the top of the

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,599
list

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,560
yeah i was about to say that is hidden

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,000
yes

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,520
but you can choose anything here because

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,079
we're not going to deploy an api so

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,919
choose skip for now

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,520
next step first felt you're going to

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,839
choose public

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,399
public okay

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,560
and then all right ten select whatever

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:59,440
region makes you happiest

00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:01,599
ah central us is probably close to me

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,480
uh-oh you do not have permission to

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,359
create a

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,400
i can't the zoom bars in the rest i

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,920
can't

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,760
yes and everybody in the learn module

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,599
you can see this exact message in the

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,359
learn module uh basically it means you

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,480
need to select the sandbox

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,480
so hit select existing okay it's going

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,640
to point you at the free azure sub

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,800
and then select whatever that long name

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,800
is

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,160
there we go yeah so essentially what

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,200
happens in azure is you have to have a

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,160
resource group

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,520
which is just sort of a i know how do

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,320
you describe it it's just a group that

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,960
you put

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,240
related resources in but in the sandbox

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,280
you're not allowed to create one they

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,000
create one for you

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,200
and that's you so you just reuse that

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,119
same

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,440
resource group now we can see that it

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,680
actually made this already for you

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,560
so over on the left what i want you to

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:55,680
do next in step 14 is right click on my

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,680
second static web app and choose open in

00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,839
portal

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,839
and you might want to zoom in a little

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,119
bit for folks

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,760
effectively your page should look

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,119
something like this

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,960
i always love the names by the way in

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,079
the url you'll see an interesting name

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,599
burke's is a calm mushroom

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,920
oh yeah right here fantastic

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,280
better than a paranoid mushroom i guess

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,720
so

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,200
so that's where the url will be for the

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,079
website once it's deployed

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,520
if you click on that link uh the blue

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,520
link sorry at the top

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,440
the big blue bar this one yes okay

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,839
uh click on that it'll bring us to the

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,839
runs

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,079
this is the runs for the actions and

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,599
notice that yours is still

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,599
yellow because it's still running

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,240
okay and they want you to click on azure

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,079
static web apps ci cd which you're

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,320
already on it

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,000
uh then click the topmost commit that's

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,240
titled similar to ci ad

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,359
azure static web apps then click on the

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,400
deploy and

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,520
deploy sorry build and deploy job

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,560
link on the left oh it's

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,560
it looks like it's finished

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,160
and notice everything is green and it's

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,280
got a check mark

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,680
yep this is where you can watch your

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,680
builds

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,960
okay all right the next step is to uh

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,240
view the website want to show them how

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,320
to do that

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,280
i just want to let you guys know you

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,880
have

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,920
approximately four minutes until the

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,800
next until the next break

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,200
all right we got about six minutes to go

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,400
so

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,640
we'll go slightly quicker sorry

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:47,520
i didn't here just click on the url here

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,480
so there you click on your comm mushroom

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,920
and there's your app

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:55,280
running up into uh azure

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,119
perfect all right so let's go back and

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
we've done all this

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,079
yeah we had a couple of people who

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,599
struggled there some people got stuck on

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,000
the sandbox i saw

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,760
it's waiting for permissions there uh

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,160
camille i know craig's working with you

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,800
on that

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
if we run out of time here find us on

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,160
twitter

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,000
uh you can find me john underscore papa

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,480
on twitter afterwards and i will work

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,960
with you

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:22,560
offline craig and i do that

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,640
i won't volunteer burke i'll do it

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,760
i'll do it okay burke will do it too so

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,359
we can do that too

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,880
yeah exactly jenna's like find me

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,119
offline online

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,320
exactly offline online out of this

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,640
session let's put it that way

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,480
all right should we skip to the exercise

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,160
to speed this up here a little bit

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,480
yeah just go right to the exercise the

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,320
one thing we didn't do quite yet

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,079
uh was if you go back to the running app

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,160
perk

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,920
if you refresh on that page since it's

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,119
at a products hyperlink it's going to

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,720
say not found

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,320
so we want to fix that for everybody

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,359
that's what the next exercise is going

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,680
to do

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,280
so we should note that it works as if

00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,280
you navigate it's when you try to go

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,079
directly to the page

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,440
that's when it fails which is because

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,440
browser doesn't know

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,880
what that this url exists but the

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,480
application does

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,800
so we need to figure out a way to tell

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,760
it to route all traffic back to this

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,280
base url

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,200
so that it can then take care of the

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,599
routing on the front end

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,480
so we have to jump back to vs code in

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,599
unit six

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,960
that's the last exercise and the first

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,520
thing you gotta do is you have to pull

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,520
the code

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,760
pull the latest code yeah so i'm going

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,680
to do that by clicking down here

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,359
in the status bar and the reason we're

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,320
doing this is because that work that

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,760
action file

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,280
needs to come down it's in the github

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,079
workflows folder that burke is now

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,200
opening up

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,000
you want to show it to them real quick

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,440
that'd be cool

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,359
now we're going to create a new file

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,400
called routes.json

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:54,480
inside of our svelt app public folder

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,480
so new file routes.json

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,280
and then you want to flip back over to

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,400
learn because you're going to copy the

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,599
contents of that

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,599
and paste it into the file

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,960
and this is basically saying that if

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,720
somebody tries to go to slash products

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,160
like burke just refreshed on that

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,920
it's going to automatically redirect to

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:16,079
index.html so you don't get that 404.

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,079
now you need to commit those changes

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,680
add fallback route and then commit them

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,440
by hitting command enter or pressing the

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,920
button

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,520
and then you can push those up which

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,400
burke likes to do by hitting the bottom

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,839
left-hand button

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,680
yeah i'm hitting this button down here

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,079
in the status bar it doesn't look like a

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,000
button

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,520
but it is now it basically says to go

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,520
try the fallback route once it's done

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,480
but we need to jump over to the actions

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,599
in github

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,200
so we can see it building so if you

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,800
click back on actions you'll see

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,839
a yellow dot again because it's

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,040
rebuilding the app because he pushed up

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,800
changes

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,319
so on build and deploy on the left which

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,560
he clicked on we're seeing it's

00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,440
it's yellow this step here is basically

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,599
setting up the

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,880
environment to do the build before the

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,960
deploy

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,560
the step after that the run actions and

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,720
build and deploy that's when it actually

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,000
runs npm install and will deploy the

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,200
site

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,440
i think the whole thing takes about a

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:20,640
minute and a half

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:24,720
yeah you can see it doing its thing here

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,720
lots of strange words like oryx

00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,839
so jenna doesn't mean twitter ah

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,319
oh jenna you are you are ahead of the

00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,720
game

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,359
no you know i'm on twitter but i don't

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,280
i'm not

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,960
i'm not super happy about it i will put

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,240
a secret email address

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,480
that only you can see i'm kidding i

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,720
i honestly i think you're better off

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,160
there you go if you want to email me at

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,520
microsoft i'd be happy to help you out

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,720
there too we can connect to

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,359
me and craig burke that way perfect

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,400
or any of you for that matter finished

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,319
it's finished

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,160
cool it's finished oh thank you for

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,480
using azure static website even thanked

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,079
me

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,400
okay it's very kind so it's green so now

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,760
you should go back to the website berk

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,280
and you should be able to go to products

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,560
and hit the refresh button and you will

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,119
no longer get a

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,160
404 yeah so i don't it looks like

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,319
nothing happened

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,839
but up here in this url now if we went

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,640
straight to products

00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:26,000
or about so let's just grab this do a

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,000
new tab and paste it in

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,119
no i have tried collections many times

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,800
and it works goes directly there

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,319
so because we're short on time we're

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,160
gonna we're gonna skip the knowledge

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,760
check but if you do the knowledge check

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,560
if you like to gamify your lives

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,319
everybody

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,599
in learn there's a knowledge check that

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,119
you can run

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,480
which basically asks you three questions

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,040
and if you answer these right you get

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,640
points

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,880
on the platform which is really kind of

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,640
cool and fun basically just reinforces

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,160
what you've learned

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,760
burke you mind if i shares my screen

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,240
real quick if you unsure yeah yeah let

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,079
me let me kill it one second here

00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,440
stop share all right tell you all the

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,400
links where you can get everything we

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,400
just did everybody

00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:10,240
all right so i will go

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,599
zoom past all this so here's the links

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,640
for everything we just did you can try

00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,400
offline

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,319
you can go to learn at the link at the

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,319
top that's what we just did today

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,599
if you want to look into more advanced

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,200
scenarios we have

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,800
ato 20-swa which is all of our

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,520
documentation

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,400
and if you want to try blazer or jquery

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,800
as burke said

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,400
if you go to this repo at the bottom you

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,880
can use one of those repos

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,680
uh sorry one of the examples in the repo

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,520
for uh

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,359
trying this out too i'll click on it so

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:44,850
you can see what that does

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,000
um no remind me later github

00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:48,880
[Laughter]

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,160
it's the worst time for that i know yeah

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,359
here's my security key there you go

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,760
everybody

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,280
so if you're using alpine angular irelia

00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,200
backbone elm glimmer

00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,440
ionic jquery marco polo

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,280
whatever you want basically you can grab

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,079
this repo there's an example of all of

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,160
these

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,680
in there and we even tell you what the

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,160
build steps you can run are

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,200
what folder is the artifact folder that
