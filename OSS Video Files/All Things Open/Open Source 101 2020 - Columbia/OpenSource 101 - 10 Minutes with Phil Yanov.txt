okay very good so I'm here with with

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,869
filly on off of tech after five and a

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,429
few other initiatives Phil I've really

00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:13,320
admired your work for a very long period

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,639
of time I would tell you that even if

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,039
you weren't here today sitting in front

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,250
of me but you are and I will say it loud

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,630
and proud extremely impressed with what

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,240
you've done you've been at it for a long

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,470
time you've been persistent and

00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,939
persistence is sometimes in my

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,230
experience the greatest challenge quite

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,579
frankly you've been doing this a long

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,220
time you've been a staple in the tech

00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:33,390
community but I venture to say that even

00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,520
though you've been around a while you

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,140
continue to do amazing work a lot of

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,600
people still don't know a lot about you

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,130
so what I was hoping today to do today

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,490
to accomplish today was really to get

00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,410
you to tell us what you do what you're

00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,890
about what your mission is why you exist

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,930
and why you know what's really ahead

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,760
what you then tend to do moving forward

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,700
what they can be on the lookout for yeah

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,800
well thank you for that I mean and you

00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,140
know from one convener to another right

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,060
I mean we're both pulling together

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,270
groups of people because we think it's

00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,190
important right you and I both know that

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,470
if we can bring our collective

00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,260
communities together they'll build

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,650
something all I gotta do is take smart

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,390
people and put them in a room and they

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,760
will build things they just can't help

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,350
themselves so you know you've got this

00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,710
with open source what a fabulous

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,940
community you've built and I'm just

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,500
trying to do it with just tech people

00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,750
right I mean I'm just trying to put IT

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,340
people together in a room so that they

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,540
will you know if they're looking for a

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,130
job they'll find it if they're looking

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,270
for someone to hire they'll find that if

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,530
they're looking for investors they're

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,540
looking for partners they're looking for

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,820
customers you know they've got a path

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,159
forward inside the room that we provide

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,380
because I just think we're making some

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,820
great conversations happen yeah I know a

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,680
lot of people that will be viewing this

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,720
and listening to this may not be located

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,190
in the state of South Carolina so that

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,260
was another reason I know you did to

00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,000
take after five events in other cities

00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,040
that happen to be located in other

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,450
states so there are people outside of

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,460
South Carolina that have some knowledge

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,409
they're familiar with what you do but I

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,420
think while there is some overlap in our

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,950
audiences I think there's a large

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,039
segment of our audiences that maybe

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,410
don't overlap so what is maybe tech

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,570
after five all about where

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,190
are you where my people find you who

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,380
knows you might even host an event in

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,230
their town oh and yeah we may well I

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,480
don't know we're but tech after five is

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,940
a series of after-hours networking

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,890
events designed primarily to bring IT

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,770
professionals in their larger community

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,140
together in each city so our motto is

00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,460
every city every month at the moment

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,140
that you and I are talking the cities

00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,000
that are live hot and active are

00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,350
Greenville South Carolina Columbia South

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,750
Carolina Charleston South Carolina

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,720
Charlotte North Carolina and Little Rock

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,340
Arkansas we have done events in other

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,630
cities you know people like run a test

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,600
and those kind of thing we've done this

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:53,510
lots of places and we just had our

00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,150
twelfth birthday in February of this

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,430
year so we've had our twelfth birthday

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,880
and we just have hosted our five hundred

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,980
and sixty-eight event Wow so but our

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,320
thing is to bring IT professionals

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,910
together in every community so you know

00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,260
in any given city there's gonna be

00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,960
somewhere between fifty and a hundred

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,270
and twenty-five people in the room in

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,980
each one of this is and the ideas we ask

00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,390
them what they're looking for we put

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,100
them in a place and then we just say

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,630
okay well you said you were looking for

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,180
partners what's a partner look like

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,940
what's a good partner for you and we put

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,040
lists out but we're it's facilitated

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,260
networking we try to leave as little to

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,520
chance as possible we want you in the

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,800
room so that you'll make something

00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,230
happen I can tell you I've attended a

00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,459
number of your events and facilitated is

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,290
a great description

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,060
you really do facilitate interaction and

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,310
engagement and dialogue and meeting your

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,290
neighbor and the person that maybe you

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,900
otherwise would never have maybe spoken

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,850
to or gotten to know which i think is

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,560
fantastic and you really do a good job

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,390
and again I've attended your events for

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,590
a number of years and I've even attended

00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,000
them in different cities I've attended

00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,739
the one in Charlotte I think you do a

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,180
great job there as well so I would

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,830
strongly encourage anyone listening or

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,750
watching to certainly come out check you

00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,209
out online see what the schedule might

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,070
be and go to an event they're really

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,280
really good yeah thank you for that I

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:12,350
mean we we love what we do and we've

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,840
been at this a while so we've learned an

00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,940
awful lot and you know for us it's just

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,739
how do we keep this going right and when

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,860
I see how it's running just fine

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:26,310
now it's finding new cities so now we're

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,350
talking to Nashville Tennessee we're

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,139
talking to someone in Arizona we're

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,050
talking to Virginia in Ohio and

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,210
Pennsylvania so it you know we're now

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,919
the next step you ask me like where we

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,680
might be headed at this thing right our

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,449
next step is how do we make this so that

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,820
other people can go run these in their

00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,380
own backyard so we kind of give them a

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,270
simple little tool kit you know if you

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,190
want to go run your own backyard tech

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,449
after 5:00 this is what it looks like so

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,820
if someone listening or watching is

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,950
interested in maybe hosting a tech after

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,840
5:00 they need to contact you yeah they

00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,880
just reach out and I'm super easy to

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,830
find but you know tech after 5:00 calm

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,260
Phil Univ on LinkedIn or Tech another

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,600
five on LinkedIn where we are easy

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,950
enough to find what else do you do

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,690
you're you're one of the more

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,970
interesting people I've ever met because

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,990
you're you're deep you know that's

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,850
that's part of it

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,090
you're a very nice person that's one

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:21,560
component of think of enjoying being

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,970
around someone or do that conversation

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,160
but you know really the other component

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,990
to me and the other aspect is you know

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,419
how deep is a person how deep is their

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,070
reservoir you know what's the level of

00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,300
their knowledge do they have something

00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,550
to offer I don't mean to sound selfish

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,169
with that but look time is limited for

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,210
everyone so when you engage someone I

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,250
think everyone even if it's in a very

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,960
subconscious way is they're they're

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,599
making that assessment does this person

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,010
is the conversation gonna yield value am

00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,720
I going to learn something or they gonna

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,700
really engaging you in an intellectual

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,770
level you've always done that your

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,020
reservoir is very deep what do you I

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,139
mean how did it become how did it become

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,450
so deep I mean so what what do you do

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,820
what have you done yeah you know I think

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,950
for us or for me anyway it's just to be

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,440
curious I mean I've got to hang around

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,570
some really awesome people over the

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,270
course of my career and it's just to

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,070
absorb what is in their heads right and

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,470
the only way I know to do that is to ask

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:18,599
great questions and I thought wow that

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,849
just kind of fits in really well with

00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,930
what we do I'm asking to put you people

00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:24,750
in a room and have them talk to each

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,570
other let's teach them how to ask good

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,210
questions let's not assume I know the

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,999
answers let's let's go a little further

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,559
with our conversation

00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:36,829
and I just think that's worked out

00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:38,779
really extraordinarily and people get it

00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,229
right and that's why really interesting

00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:42,559
people

00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:44,059
I mean fascinating people walk into the

00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,869
room at Tech after 5:00 you never know

00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:46,849
what you're gonna get

00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:47,899
what else do you do should people be

00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,909
aware of anything else that you're doing

00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:51,889
I think you might host a podcast

00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,569
oh yeah I got it so we've attached a

00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,699
podcast now in fact I'm on a couple of

00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:58,099
podcasts regularly but the tech after

00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:00,079
five podcast you know I want to help my

00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,429
tech community figure out how to move

00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,499
the ball forward for themselves so

00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,969
sometimes it's their career how do I

00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:06,769
help them in that you know using tools

00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,749
like LinkedIn to do that but a lot of

00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:11,389
times they're building a tech business

00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:13,909
of their own and I'm trying to help them

00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,379
figure that bit out right so again that

00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:17,599
might be using LinkedIn this time to

00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:20,179
find customers as opposed to find hiring

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,889
organizations but it might be that how

00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:23,929
do they build their own tribe you know I

00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:26,059
think that what we've done has worked

00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:28,939
really well for me in my community and

00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:31,249
I'm delighted to see you building your

00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:33,169
community and we've heard other stories

00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:34,489
here at this event where people are

00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:36,439
building their own community I don't

00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:38,989
help people do that I want to help them

00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:43,550
build the communities that they want to

00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:46,039
support you know none of us how's that

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,019
how do I put this we're all fortunate to

00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,699
have a lot of people love on us and be

00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,739
able to do that now if we can extend our

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:53,389
support back out in the community let's

00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:54,919
figure out how to do that right let's

00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,929
figure out how to help each other do

00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,099
what we're doing so I do that in little

00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:59,479
groups I do it in big groups you know

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,129
I've got a little small group of

00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,289
mastermind guys that I meet with on a

00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:05,029
regular basis every week we sit down and

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,949
say how do we move the ball for it

00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:08,509
but mostly it's just asking the right

00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,819
questions and saying okay let me help

00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:12,679
you with this so this might I hope this

00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,329
is okay to ask do you do you offer

00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:17,089
consulting services I mean if someone

00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:19,759
would come to I mean is that you know

00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:21,709
sort of a target for you or do you maybe

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,299
in a secondary way you offer consulting

00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,459
services but maybe it's not a primary

00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:26,779
service that you offer I'd yeah no so I

00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:29,179
always wanted to ask that question ya

00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,860
know I'm kind of out of time for most of

00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:32,689
what I do so it's gonna have to be

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,759
something pretty big somethings high

00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:36,829
impacts for us to do sort of like notes

00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,870
and so I could do all of that but you

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:40,789
know mostly it's in group settings I've

00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,130
done this in group settings just so it's

00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,050
a little easier on my schedule because I

00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,279
think what we're building to taken up

00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,810
don't I understand well you're obviously

00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,760
doing a great job you can tell that by

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,080
the results again every meeting I've

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,420
ever gone - it's gone extremely

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,250
extremely well you know and I'll say

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,620

00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:00,050
events and you did a really great job so

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,329
if anyone listening or watching needs an

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,709
emcee you really do a great job you're

00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:05,930

industry you have the baseline requisite

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,070
knowledge to be able to emcee a

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,560
technology event or maybe even other

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,149
types of events but the one or two that

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,779
