Abstract: Whether you are contemplating starting your container journey or are already on that journey and looking for deeper insight to help you progress, we have the answers for you at SUSE.

There are many challenges to administering a multi-cluster Kubernetes ecosystem, whether it begins at the operating system level, terminates at the cloud, or at an edge endpoint. "Running At Scale" means having highly-available services that can be run at large scale to service users globally, update these services several times an hour to roll out new features, all without service disruption. Kubernetes also will take care of networking, connecting containers with each other, and of providing storage for containers to name a few. 

SUSE offers robust tools for you to operate converged container and virtual infrastructure across a range of mixed cloud environments. We enable you to run legacy workloads alongside cloud-native applications in the digital enterprise. Our solutions help you deploy and manage applications at scale across organizations, clusters and clouds
