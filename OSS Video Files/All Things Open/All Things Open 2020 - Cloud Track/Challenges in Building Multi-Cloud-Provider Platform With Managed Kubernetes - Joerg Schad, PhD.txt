Abstract: Building a cloud-agnostic platform used to be a challenging task as one had to deal with a large number of different cloud APIs and service offerings. Today, as most Cloud providers are offering a managed Kubernetes solution (e.g., GKE, AKS, or EKS), it seems like developers could simply build a platform based on Kubernetes and be cloud-agnostic. While this assumption is mostly correct, there are still a number of differences and pitfalls when deploying across those managed Kubernetes solutions.

This talk discusses the experiences made while building the ArangoDB Managed Service offering across and GKE, AKS, or EKS.

While the (managed) Kubernetes API being a great abstraction from the actual cloud provider, a number of challenges remain including for example networking, autoscaler, cluster provisioning, or node sizing. This talk provides an overview of those challenges and also discuss how they were solved as part of the ArangoDB managed Service.
