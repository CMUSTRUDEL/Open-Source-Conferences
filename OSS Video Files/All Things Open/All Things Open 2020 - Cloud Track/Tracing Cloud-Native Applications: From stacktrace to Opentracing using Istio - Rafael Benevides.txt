Abstract: We, developers, were used to debug applications on thread at a time. However, with the advent of microservices architectures, what used to be a single stack trace in a single machine became many stack traces spread among computers. Come to this session to see how to perform a distributed tracing in your application using Jaeger with Opentracing. In this presentation's demo we use Java and NodeJS and run them on containers using Kubernetes and Istio.
