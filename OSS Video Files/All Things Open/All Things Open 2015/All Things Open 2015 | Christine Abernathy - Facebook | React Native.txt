all right yeah so this is actually going

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:15,599
to be an introductory talk about but

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,400
react native and first of all you can't

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,930
actually talk about react native without

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,699
talking about react so react is the is

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,949
basically a JavaScript library for

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:30,300
building UI and what I'm going to do is

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,790
I'm actually going to tell your story to

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,180
just kind of give you an idea of of what

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,989
this means so I've been sort of like

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,270
binge watching heroes on netflix for

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,980
like the last couple weeks and I thought

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,899
I'd seen the whole series but apparently

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,840
I got stuck somewhere to save the

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,100
cheerleader save the woman so I went

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,480
back and I've been watching a lot of

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,210
them because it's sort of been on my

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,030
mind and I use this story so there's my

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,199
favorite characters name is hero he's

00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,859
got a special gift he can teleport

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,480
through time through space and he's a

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,860
really cool hero so why don't we it does

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,740
that he goes through at least from what

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,340
I've seen he goes to this process super

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,260
awesome drawing so he usually just he's

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,030
somewhere and then when he wants to

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,710
teleport he just gets into the soul like

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,860
zone where he concentrated really hard

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,810
and then he may find himself in a new

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,460
place maybe maybe not and then when he

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,450
does he's just gives this kind of a huge

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,939
cry like I did it so it's always cool to

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,590
watch could be such a happy character as

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,020
I wanted to say use this as an example

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,450
of let's say I wanted to actually create

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,909
something which says hero good teleport

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,220
what would it look like sort of in some

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,259
kind of random JavaScript code it might

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,329
look something like this where there are

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,189
certain states representing each in

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,290
particular part and for each we're going

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,790
to transition to reach state might have

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,050
something like a teleport state which

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,300
starts off and so

00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,060
begin and then we loop around and we

00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,670
wait sort of one frame between so the

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,350
first thing is and we wait until he's

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,960
done so the first thing maybe that if i

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,510
sees if if he's actually go back once

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,760
one thing if he first finds out that he

00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,950
needs to begin he's going to start going

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,120
to concentrate bowden you can think

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,560
about it in the background this is

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,200
probably manipulating if it's a webapp

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,450
some dong and then the next thing if he

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,790
is now in the next thing which is I it's

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,960
in progress then at that point he's

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,600
going to open his eyes i'm sort of

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,580
like-- see you on what's going on and

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,120
where am i and then the next day she

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,010
might go in and check where he is now at

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,110
this point we're going to sort of some

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,320
random thing that says what is the

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,850
currency and if it looks like he's in a

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,340
new place that he successfully

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,080
teleported and he's going to lift his

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,550
hands up and give a shout of victory so

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,190
you can see that it's almost like we're

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,020
using all these state to kind of

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,060
transitions through and has manipulating

00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,680
the Dom so this is what it would look

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,180
like and we like to think of this as

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,410
sort of like imperative way of

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,720
programming where you're just giving a

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,520
set of instructions line after line and

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,410
doing things so the difference with the

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,780
reactors encourage introduces a

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,910
different card I'm where are you

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,989
describing your application and it's

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,870
like a UI centric and this view is a US

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,489
based on the state so you can actually

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,870
based on a state figure out what it's

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,860
going to look like and it's a little

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:25,050
different so if we take again a little

00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,730
hiroko hero so you might actually you

00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,220
can think of them as different parts and

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,590
self transitioning by state you can say

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,500
what does hero look like when he's

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,120
actually concentrating so the only part

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,709
that's you can see that changes is

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,290
perhaps this kind of eyes are open or

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,440
closed so if it's teleporting his eyes

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,030
are going to be closed

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,620
you can just look at this don't worry

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,540
about the language right now we're going

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,550
to explain it in a little bit on the

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,430
other hand if he is now sort of another

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,720
state where he has successfully

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,400
teleported his hands are going to go up

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,080
so it's always like if you're thinking

00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,750
about it's a little different so you're

00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,670
just describing that the UI based on

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,800
certain states are you teleporting are

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,840
you not teleporting was it I you know

00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,690
teleport success state are you not and

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,220
if you look at if we rearrange this code

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,050
a little differently so we just have

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,820
this state whether not you're

00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,670
teleporting or whether not teleport is

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,230
successful and you can set it up using

00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,320
some of the different states but at the

00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:24,170
end of the day what you have is this UI

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,780
which is basically a class and if you

00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,760
think about it again I'm going to go

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,560
into a little bit more detail but it's

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,880
made out of say maybe a divil class

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,800
which is here which is sort of like the

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,470
background image of them but then you

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,900
have two things is what's what's

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,370
changing as his eyes open and what was

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,170
this is hands look like then that's

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,330
basically when you look at it it's a

00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:47,330
little easier to just look at the UI and

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,420
kind of know what's going on so that's

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,370
actually what our reactors is is you

00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:55,700
want to think about it and you are in in

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,560
react world a UI is composed of

00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,630
something called components so the basic

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,120
building block of a react is a component

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,760
and you use those building blocks to

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,680
compose your app and i'm going to show

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,170
you one particular example sort of like

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,290
a hello message component so this is a

00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:15,610
class and it's a if you look at the

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:18,430
syntax it's every component implements

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,520
random which actually composes the UI

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,259
and it's got this XML like syntax which

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,610
the first time people see it just kind

00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,150
of like throws them off and they're like

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,919
this is just terrible but it's jsx and

00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,569
you're wondering why do you have mark up

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,490
all over my my code but this example of

00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:38,740
once you kind of get used to it you find

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,659
that it's a little it's actually easier

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,389
easier to use but it just takes a little

00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:46,150
getting used to so in this particular

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:48,279
component called a hello message a diff

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,199
as being returned and it's being

00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,110
returned based on something that's being

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,639
passed in called a desktop prop so in

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,069
this case a name and then it's going to

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,840
print it out and a component not only

00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:01,419
can have properties passed into it but

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,219
it can have also its own internal state

00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,319
which can be accessed via the start

00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:07,270
state and when you want to add a

00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,370
component to kind of get into shorts say

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,860
on the web app you would do something if

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,449
it's a web app like a react Dom dot

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,250
render and then you pass in the

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:16,900
component and at the end of the day you

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,449
also pass in where you want it to be

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,789
martyred it could be like a download so

00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:25,060
this is how you would typically say just

00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:27,310
have a react coda just show up on the

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,229
screen behind the scene what's happening

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,250
is that the reactive framework is is

00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:35,020
going in and actually taking this

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:38,440
weird-lookin syntax it's transpiring it

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,719
using a gsx I spy likes a bagel and then

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,839
it's going to throw out something that

00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:46,210
the browser can understand so let's talk

00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,919
a little bit about state versus props I

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,129
said before that a component can have

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,569
steak and it's usually created within

00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:55,389
the component and it's something that

00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:57,129
only the component cares about its you

00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,229
can actually read the stained using this

00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:01,300
start state in this example we have a

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:04,689
comment list component and there is one

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,279
comment which is uh so there's this like

00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:08,409
the state of next day the comments maybe

00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,139
grab the comments from a server

00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:12,879
somewhere you can also um you take the

00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,050
states are you in this case if you want

00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,849
to

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,979
take the state you just do it this dot

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:18,720
set state and that's how you handle

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,550
stays on the other hand we have

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,099
something called props in this example

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,289
we have a common list and a common list

00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:28,139
can actually call another component

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:30,629
which is a common and it can pass

00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,520
information into this comment and this

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:35,580
could be a problem that the difference

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,639
in the props are immutable you can

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,500
actually set a default within the within

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,300
the actually component but and you can

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,610
also check and validate to see if it's

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,009
the proper type but other than that you

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:51,060
cannot change a prop within a component

00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:52,800
so the other thing I'm going to talk

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,800
about like three features that react

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,060
gives you and one of the key features is

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,979
it will kind of give you an insight into

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,870
another thing that makes our react

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:04,319
pretty cool there's something called a

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,030
virtual Dom so when not what react

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,740
framework does in the background is

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,419
there's actually four you can think of

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,430
if it's a web app there's actually the

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:13,349
Dom that's in the browser there is a

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,530
virtual Dom that's actually running like

00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:18,060
an memory in JavaScript and when you are

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,740
actually sending commands to it the

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,719
virtual Dom is going to look at the

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,639
current state or the current prob

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:25,949
compare it to say what's happening next

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,219
and then make only the changes that are

00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,990
necessary to get into the next state so

00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:34,320
if you go through this flow typically

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,930
you have a view which represents some

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,940
some state and then after that maybe the

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,279
user may interact with it and at that

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,320
point it's going to change the state or

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,820
the prop and it's going to cycle through

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,620
the virtual dogs going to figure out

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,930
what is the minimum set of changes it

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,450
needs to implement the next set of views

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,310
it makes this really perform it in terms

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,130
of say the UI just acts a little bit

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,890
faster so that's another one thing that

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,440
react has another thing that react

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,790
components are visits composable so if

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,209
you look at this example again you've

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,399
got a

00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:08,759
that can have multiple comments in it

00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:10,709
and each comment information might be

00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,300
passed from the pairing comment list but

00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:14,339
each of them is sort of self-contained

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,429
with everything that it needs to do to

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,809
know to run it so this common versus

00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:21,269
that common each of them very well

00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:24,059
self-contained another feature that

00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:27,449
react actually like to propose is sort

00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,860
of like a one-way data flow so kind of

00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:30,839
different from traditional where you

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,369
have like two-way binding when we

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,769
actually like to think that sort of all

00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:37,740
all data flows in one way so again to

00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:40,110
the example of the Communist it may pass

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,119
to its child components that information

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,040
through all these different props so an

00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:46,019
example also you'll actually have maybe

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,610
a common may have like another component

00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,889
in it which is to say for example

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,920
something that demonstrates a light and

00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:54,540
it again gets passed in and saying maybe

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,980
somebody clicked on the like and say so

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,050
now how you're going to actually update

00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,970
that well the way we typically want it

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,730
to get down as you might set up so like

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,889
an event call back it goes back to the

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,720
parent and then makes that change and

00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:08,850
they're sort of data flows one way it's

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,160
a lot easier for example now in this

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,959
particular paradigm to figure out where

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,790
it's safe changing because for some of

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,619
the other ways of doing say JavaScript

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,809
you might just get confused who change

00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:20,279
the data so this is actually a much much

00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:23,069
easier way to kind of reason about

00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,829
what's going on so that's got like a a

00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:29,160
very very quick walkthrough of what

00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:30,540
react is and there's obviously a lot of

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,929
documentation that you can go and get

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,899
started so react was open sourced a few

00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:38,699
years ago and it's been doing pretty

00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,970
well and then earlier this year we

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:44,040
actually open source react for iOS and

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,480
the last couple of months react for

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,329
Android so that's what I'm going to talk

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,160
about next so what is react native react

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:52,670
native is basically a framework for

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,090
building and native apps emphasis

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:58,160
made using reacts so previously you saw

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,560
that the virtual dog may actually send

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,680
information and in my view browser and

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,150
Dom but it doesn't have to be and so

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,360
that's where I react native comes up

00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,740
comes in and just to step back and just

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,990
kind of give you a case for why we

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,420
actually ended up working on react

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,250
native react actually itself was built

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,750
out of a necessity from the ads

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,870
engineering team that needed to work

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,760
with large-scale data and the same same

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,100
team as you have spearheaded what was

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,660
done with their react native so there's

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,910
two actually issues that we have a

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,270
Facebook that we would try and solve

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,550
number one is that native is just like

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,900
an inherent better experience so when

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,060
you're actually going whether it's in

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,940
your iphone or android scrolling touch

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,830
handling gestures just feel a lot nicer

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,360
if it's a native experience versus safe

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,910
is something that's like wrapped in a

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,350
webview so that's one thing that you

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,480
want to keep when we are when we're

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,910
developing a spur are for people who are

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,590
using facebook apps but on the other

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,420
hand so that's actually key and we

00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,400
really want to keep that and sometimes

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,740
at least in our history that kind of

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,450
went against other thing that we care

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,370
about is developer experience and how we

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:07,070
can move fast and actually create these

00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,740
apps so on the flip side with developer

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:12,440
experience we wanted to see what we can

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,360
do to just increase the speed at which

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,120
engineers our facebook work or working

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,880
in kind of creating apps and so for that

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,680
what react native or reactor react

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,320
native brings to the table is just

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,150
trying to put some of the best and say

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,010
web development experience that bring it

00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,930
to mobile development and that's what

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,970
react was trying to solve and i'll show

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,530
you a few things i also want to tell you

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,750
a story was sort of some of the things

00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:39,530
that we did so this is the mobile ad

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:41,820
manager program and on your left hand

00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:43,500
side is the iOS version of the

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,890
right hand side of the Android version

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:50,430
of the app so we actually had ads

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:52,860
engineers who were web developers not

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,420
iOS or Android build these two versions

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,480
and when they build the iOS version

00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,180
first and I'm kind of went through it

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,980
took the same they took the same the

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,320
same folks actually turn around the same

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,910
team and build android version in about

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,620
three months we're using about

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,420
eighty-five percent of the code if you

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,970
look at the pieces in the middle which

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,620
is like the list view and the business

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,630
logic those are most of the pieces that

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,880
were reuse but things that were very

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,220
specific to iOS or Android such as

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,620
navigation those who made our separate

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,120
but this was actually a huge win because

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,710
the folks who worked on this project

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,630
they were not Iowa's or Android

00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,520
engineers these were ads engineers and

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,230
they knew exactly how they wanted to

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,760
build a product so when you have a

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,980
father this is a great win and we've

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,600
open source both react and react native

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,790
as I said eighty-five percent of the

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,780
Cold War share and going back to the

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,100
example of the virtual Dom when we have

00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,140
before I showed you like a hello message

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,230
with a div when you're working with say

00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:51,750
uh iOS you will be using things such as

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,390
views and in this case if you would map

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,880
into a uiview or a text or an image

00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,980
likewise into the UI kit equivalent and

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,900
that's how things with map so this is

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,690
why it's actually a native app it's not

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,210
actually JavaScript running similarly

00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:09,450
for Android of you would map into say if

00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:11,430
a new frame they are and the text into a

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,080
text view and an image into an image you

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,810
and that's how we get the native

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,850
experience and so what we've learned out

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,860
of all of this is that the idea behind

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,210
reactivated

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,010
is that you're going to learn to code

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:24,050
the reactor and once you learn how to do

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,200
it that way you can use those skills to

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,810
develop an end of platform so let's go

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,270
ahead and show you how you can actually

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,910
get set up and running with react native

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,110
so first thing we want to do is there

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,850
some requirements that you have to

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,580
install these include things like home

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,560
glue and no Jas once you've got that up

00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,150
and running if you're developed for iOS

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,860
or Android you would then set up the

00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,050
environments that you need as an iOS

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,360
developers into Xcode and in anger you

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,160
need android sdk and a few other things

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,360
and then the next thing is to just

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,160
install the react CL is an MPN package

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,860
you just bring that down installed it

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,320
globally and then after that you sort of

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,870
get you're now ready to a setup would

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,260
react in this case you just ran to run a

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,850
CLI command react native in it and then

00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,010
the name of your app and then so you're

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,050
good to go so let's go ahead and

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:19,240
actually go through a demo and just show

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,240
you how a few things are working here

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:43,139
alright so here I have internal and it

00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:43,139
is

00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,250
let's make sure it was I chosen

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:14,199
okay so what you see here is is that

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:18,509
terminal where I actually just want a

00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:21,790
single time I she had runner react

00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:23,500
native in it so I previously just run

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,540
the command to initialize my react

00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,250
native app and what I did is pulled in

00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,350
all of them NPM packages that were

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,149
needed and created all the template

00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,009
files and then it kind of gave me

00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:35,470
instructions at the end if you want to

00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:38,410
run your app in iOS do this alone around

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,779
an Android do that so I'm going to show

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,690
you what it looks like when it's get set

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:47,500
up so once you've got a set up on you

00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:49,240
just open up tax code and within s code

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,170
you can just basically run the project

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,880
and when you do let's go ahead kind of

00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:57,360
get the project morning actually it's

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,360
going to say

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:07,230
so what happens is it actually then runs

00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:09,899
a so what's happening here it's exactly

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,659
starting on node.js server is running a

00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:14,579
packager script its packaging all of the

00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,350
code thats related to this project and

00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,449
i'm going to show you the code and then

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:22,770
it's all running in here and then we

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:24,839
have this up so you can see in the

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:27,000
simulator is up and running welcome to

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,710
react native and the same thing can be

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,200
done from android so actually i could

00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:36,090
run the mr. some minimize that so from

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,159
android actually i can run the same

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:42,990
thing and get it set up and running I've

00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:45,360
got a case of Android I have a emulator

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,940
up and running and it's actually the

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,520
same code running reactivated welcome

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,950
and it's got different files let's look

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,539
at the code to see what we've got set up

00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,539
I have a code Ronnie

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,020
as well

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,650
thank you all right so here's the code

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,049
that we're looking at sort of like Hello

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,059
a wall that just gets you up and running

00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:21,679
and you see it here it says welcome to

00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:25,880
react native and I can actually change

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:31,910
this and just add something say I OS and

00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:35,360
then if I look at here I could actually

00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:37,190
do command R and then it's basically I

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,960
have it all running it's much easier

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,730
experience than say you need a of

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,740
traditional Iowa's program where you

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,450
have to kind of rebuild things and the

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,669
other thing i can do is i can also

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,410
enable right lively low so that any time

00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:52,040
I make a change so long as I just have

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:55,160
saved on my IDE or a salon whatever you

00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,110
use it's going to instantly make short

00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,880
over there same thing with an Android

00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,600
one I can also go to this particular

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:09,100
file which is indexed on Android rjs and

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:09,100
they can change if i go back to Maya

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:18,830
Maya simulator and just a refresh it

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:20,330
I'll be able to see the latest change so

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,179
it says it adds this thing so it makes

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:26,450
it much easier to do native development

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:29,540
this way so I'll just a kind of quickly

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,190
say what's going on here when we this

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,130
code that is running in here and

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,500
actually produces a bundle file and this

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,799
bundle file is trans file and it then

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,600
gets generated into all these JavaScript

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,150
objects which then can get run on the

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,190
the browser so the reactor a mug does

00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,830
all the magic with

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:50,710
virtual Dom etc and then spits out their

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,870
views as necessary so I'm going to

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,550
quickly go back to my presentation just

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,150
give you an idea of some of the

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,150
different things that

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,779
so whenever so what's happening in the

00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:17,779
background is we each whether its iOS or

00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,580
Android a ship to the JavaScript

00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:22,590
executed and what the Java executor does

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,480
and it depends on javis can call which

00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,610
runs in this one fryer wasn't one for

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,429
Android and there's a bridge in between

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,559
that pushes commands back and forth so

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,630
you can make JavaScript calls in to

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,340
natal and also you can the native can

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,409
expose all these UI kit and all these

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,899
frameworks back to the JavaScript code

00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:41,789
and the other cool thing is the method

00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:43,260
calls are also utilized as they go

00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:45,360
through the bridge and then

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,490
communication is backs and it's a sink

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,380
and that makes it performance so there's

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,450
something that will run on background

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,250
threads so all the JavaScript code runs

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,500
and back up ground threads if you have

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,880
any special modules that also runs in

00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,760
the background threads but anything to

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,559
say uikit related or UI that runs on a

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,179
main threat but what this all means is

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,769
that it actually is pretty performance

00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,450
so things that you're scrolling can

00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:08,130
happen a lot most moving smoothly

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,260
because it's not being blocked by any

00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,600
sort of long-running friends so that's

00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,980
what's going on so with that in mind

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,649
let's actually have a little bit more

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,850
fun and yes create an app so what I'm

00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,950
going to create is I'm going to create

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,669
an app thinking about this last Thursday

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,109
and I said you know

00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:24,629
I've never actually played around with

00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:27,600
the instagram api so let's see if we can

00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:30,419
create a car like a pseudo instagram app

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,769
and taking saw the key pieces and this

00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,779
will just kind of give you a flair for

00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:36,119
what it means to develop within

00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:38,009
deactivated so the first thing I did is

00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:41,429
I went to Instagram and I signed up for

00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:43,590
a developer account and then grab the

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:47,519
Nexus token and decided I was going to

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:49,679
use this API which allows me to get my

00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:58,409
feed and I'm like okay what does that

00:21:49,679 --> 00:22:00,029
look like so I decided to okay so this

00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:02,369
is kind of like a snapshot of feet i was

00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:04,559
looking at and then I like okay well

00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:07,590
what does the data look like so i used

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,299
postman to get me sort of a snapshot of

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,159
the data that's going to come back with

00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:14,129
I'm like okay this looks pretty cool let

00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:17,789
me go ahead and use this to create an

00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:20,009
app so first things first I just took a

00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:21,989
snapshot of that data so all of these

00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:24,899
getting some dinner and just for the

00:22:21,989 --> 00:22:27,359
purposes of expediency I save that on a

00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:29,429
local file so that i can make make

00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,700
changes and pull the data so that's

00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:38,009
actually what the setup is and now let's

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:40,200
go back to our our IDE on you Clyde and

00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:42,119
let's go started like making changes and

00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,220
I'm going to make changes in iOS and

00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:46,220
just watch it live reload

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:55,279
right so here's our iOS app and the

00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,720
first thing I want to do is let me just

00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,120
kind of get an idea of what I want to do

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,009
I want to have a list and then this list

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,200
list i'm going to show all this data but

00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:06,649
just to kind of get started let's uh

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,240
let's add say just the username for the

00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:11,090
instagram for each one of these photos

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,389
and i'm going to change things in here

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:16,730
first thing i'm going to do is there's

00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:18,200
the react provides some components out

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,730
of the box and one of them is called on

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,990
this view component that allows you to

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:27,320
make up to create a list so let me go

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:30,320
ahead and actually I gosh I like using

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,919
the ESS yes 2015 same time so I'm just

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,059
going to switch to that there's

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,539
different ways that you can actually

00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:41,379
create this and I'm just going to use

00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:41,379
that syntax

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,830
it is at a constructor

00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:02,160
so this is a way that i can use jer

00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:04,380
syntax and this is the component which

00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,510
is sort of like the entry to my app and

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,970
it has a render function which at this

00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,860
point is just showing some views and i'm

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,090
just going to change this so as I save

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,640
this let me just make sure I didn't

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,920
break anything by switching to aes

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:21,059
syntax all that looks good so now that

00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:22,380
we have the list view so so to add the

00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:27,390
list view there's a couple of things I'm

00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,880
going to use a listview component and so

00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:33,090
what I just dropped in here is I dropped

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,230
in a listview component and unless you

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,750
can pull in one of the things that you

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,640
can pass in is information about if a

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,740
rule has changed and if it always

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,450
changes you can pass in a function that

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,910
tells you when another rule has change

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:47,460
and here's an example of how you can use

00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,470
state within a particular component so

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,059
I'm going to be cloning i'm going to

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,090
create a data source for my list view

00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:56,010
and just going to use it test data so

00:24:54,090 --> 00:25:00,030
earlier I said that I had actually saved

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:02,250
a copy of the call and let me actually

00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:05,040
bring that test data so whenever you're

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:07,580
using react you can generally bring in

00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,970
any of JavaScript files using our a

00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,710
required statement so here I'm just the

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,929
same test data that I use here I

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,920
actually have previously saved it into

00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:22,710
like sort of a feed snapshot yes I just

00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,690
exported all the data that I had so now

00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,880
the next thing I want to do is I have

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,700
set up my data source but now I actually

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,220
need to render it so to render it I'm

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:36,059
just going to go in here and I'm going

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,410
to just instead of a view and a text in

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,830
all this i'm actually going to have on

00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,830
the street

00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:54,900
this

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:56,669
so here I just change the view here so

00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,500
here i have a list view the data store

00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:59,820
comes from the state and then i have

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,500
this function here so what is the

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,500
strange thing so actually the renderer

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,850
can be a function that returns another

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,490
component that you're going to render

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:10,559
for each particular Road and let's just

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:14,970
define that and I'm going to do that

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:17,100
here so this function here this deer and

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,410
arrow takes in the road data as gets a

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,299
section ID and it gets a row idea a row

00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,940
ID and then what I'm going to do here is

00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:26,490
I'm going to take for each particular

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,110
row it's going to be basically some idle

00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,630
from Instagram I'm going to take in the

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,160
user and I'm going to take in the

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,140
username and i'm just going to display

00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:38,000
that and then the last thing i want to

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:41,370
do is in here i actually have to let

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,980
react i have to add this to a list of

00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,540
music so that we can this this is called

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,760
like a destruction commence instead of

00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,470
having to always type say react out list

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,660
for you if i do it this way I just need

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,580
to type this movie so here I've got to

00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,799
set up I've got my datasource I've got

00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,230
what's being rendered each row and I

00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:01,860
should be good to go let me help let me

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:03,960
say this and see what I handles so as

00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,000
you see now we've got like if you can

00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,770
barely see it but this at the top there

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,020
is use all the different usernames and

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,610
it's kinda like looks a little weird

00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,580
because it's all bunched up on the top

00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:18,720
so I'm going to add something that I'm

00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:20,760
going to explain tempra shortly and at

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,030
this point you're asking what am i doing

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,070
but I've actually added some spacer at

00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,630
the top and so that's kind of bringing

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,910
you into sort of the next topic which

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,919
another thing that we act does in terms

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,500
of sort of like violating a lot of I

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,330
mean separation of concerns now actually

00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,940
even added styles are just made things a

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:49,840
lot worse and you

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:51,430
so let's talk about inline styles so

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,260
there's something called flexbox that

00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:55,930
start there in the web and the web world

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,850
that allows you to do CSS very nicely

00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:00,610
and allows you to do things like have

00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:03,010
margin and topped and all these

00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:04,810
different things you can very easily set

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,300
up things against a row so in this

00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,830
example you have something that is

00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,930
probably going to be a list item in a

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,730
row and you've got an image you've got a

00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:15,730
title and you've got say some summary

00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:17,560
text and you can add styles in there and

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:21,700
these are all JavaScript objects so a

00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:23,470
style could have something called you

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,330
could set up data so such things flow in

00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,610
a certain direction so in this case

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,860
whenever you have a view and you put

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,690
things inside of the view by default

00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,980
everything closed off to down which if

00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,810
you nuts if you add something like a

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,490
flex direction then you're saying that I

00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:38,470
want I want things to flow in this

00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,820
direction in a low in a row and there

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,100
are other things that you can do to sort

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:45,190
of Center your text a lot of information

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:48,880
here and we took actually in the open

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:51,310
source of CSS layout to the CSS layout

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,250
library that we may work in objective-c

00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:56,980
and in Java and that's what we're using

00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:58,240
within react native to say if something

00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,410
somebody brings in something in flex

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,240
direction this is what it's going to

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,950
look like and believe me if you've

00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,080
actually worked with iOS and anything

00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:08,110
like auto layout etc this is actually a

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,210
lot easier to actually position your

00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:12,520
element so when I added the margin top

00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:14,500
40 for what i did is i just added a star

00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,930
which said i want everything in the view

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:20,710
to come down like 44 so that's kind of a

00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:23,110
quick intro to to CSS style and so

00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:25,450
coming back to my friend to our project

00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,820
we're going to a few other fun things

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,860
he's now all we have is this boring user

00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,220
name and we want to add some other

00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,640
things want to add for example like a

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:39,830
profile pictures and

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,740
here and so what did I just do so I

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:45,170
actually before I was just returning a

00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,140
text related to the username but now

00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:50,090
what I'm doing is I'm adding an image

00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:53,360
and so the image i'm adding there's

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:55,880
another image tag in here and again in

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,070
the jason it's exposed on to something

00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,600
called a profile picture and because

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,390
it's an image actually that lives on the

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,740
web i need to actually give it a width

00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:06,770
and a height and that's what i've done

00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:10,160
right here and so with this I should be

00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:13,040
able to now grab the image and let's see

00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,410
what happens and we've got this sort of

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,200
red screen of death I've done something

00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:19,700
wrong so what have I done wrong another

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,880
thing that react actually does that's

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,470
really good is it tells you very clearly

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,090
what you missing here so it says you're

00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,470
trying to rent a google image variable

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,810
as a reaction element you probably

00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:32,210
forgot to require the image and yes I

00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:34,460
did and I always do forget to do that so

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:38,090
here I have to go back here and if I add

00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,070
the image in the require and I refresh

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:44,090
and now suddenly I have a measuring up

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:45,230
here but actually want it nice and

00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,790
rounded so what are some of the things

00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,190
that I can do and this is going to be

00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:52,700
like a lesson more in other things that

00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:54,500
you can do it style so in this image let

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,920
me add something called a border radius

00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,650
so what a radius is a way to and I'm

00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,590
going to make it 25 and again if I save

00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,059
it suddenly everything is nice and round

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,220
it was very easy to do

00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:08,899
a lot harder to do that with the Iowas

00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,549
and the next thing I want to do is I

00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:13,519
don't want things to sort of float off

00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:15,679
the bottom I wanted to flow in a row so

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,110
I'm going to add style sheets I'm style

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,580
information here and then apply it to

00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,289
this for you to say everything under

00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,809
this view who I wanted to flow in a row

00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:26,539
fashion and so here we actually had

00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:27,919
other I donating to welcome and

00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:29,720
instruction this came with a default

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,179
project I'm also going to make a few

00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,690
changes here and make the background

00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:37,840
white and I'm just been going to add for

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,840
up

00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:48,299
so here I'm added a new style and I

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,640
saying that I want the information to

00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:52,590
flow in a row I want everything that's

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,200
in that road to be aligned in the center

00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,150
and I'm spawn some padding around it so

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,159
once I've defined that style coming back

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,380
to here where I was running it up a rope

00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,669
I'm going to add a style attribute and

00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:07,529
in fire styles die head so here I can

00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:09,000
reference the header and you've seen all

00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:10,710
these curly braces that you're seeing

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,480
here is just a way to evaluate the

00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:18,750
information so now once i refresh that

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:27,539
same its refresh automatically I must

00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:30,000
have known something of course ok so

00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:31,559
here now things are flowing in a in a

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,360
row base but let's add some more

00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:36,059
information that's out of information

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,260
about where this picture was taken and

00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:42,480
quickly if I go back here now I'm doing

00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,730
something else so now I actually want to

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,909
add not just the user name but i want to

00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:50,220
add the location just below that and to

00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:54,720
do that I'm actually going to close this

00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:57,120
another view and I just took out the row

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,440
and here are now added the user name and

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,429
the reason I've done that is i'm going

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,649
to add the location underneath that if i

00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:06,480
were to look at my test data the

00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:10,020
location is under jason off your call

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,970
location but some places applications

00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:15,140
and some don't so I'm just going to make

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:17,460
sure that the location actually exists

00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:20,309
if it does then I'm going to kind of

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,950
track the name attribute if not i'm just

00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:24,730
going to return now and here you can see

00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,950
that you can actually run function

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:29,559
right in there it's a lot easier to sort

00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:33,070
of look and see what's going on so once

00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:35,799
I say this now suddenly you see some

00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:37,929
places application some don't and it's

00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:39,220
very easy together alpha running I just

00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:40,660
don't like that they sort of close to

00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,260
each other so I'm just going to add

00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:50,260
another inline style and I'm just going

00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:52,570
to say margin left and if i refresh that

00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,910
again it just moves to the left now

00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:57,280
final town like icing on the cake let's

00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,260
add the actual picture so adding the

00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,990
picture again if you want to think about

00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,910
it I have this sort of like header row

00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:06,160
in here and i want to add the picture

00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:08,200
under each one of them and the picture

00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,419
is available in different places if i go

00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:17,350
back to the data that came from postman

00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:20,859
this and i know it's cause someone

00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:22,399
absurd full so the images the very many

00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:24,559
different kinds of

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,990
if you can actually see it clearly but

00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,579
it gives an array of images some of that

00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,049
low resolution and it tells you about

00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:32,899
the sizes I'm just going to pick the

00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:36,220
lower resolution size and show that an

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:38,450
atom so what I'm going to do now here is

00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:41,569
here so far we've got basically

00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:43,010
something that represents the header so

00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:44,899
because i'm going to add something below

00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:50,720
it i'm actually going again and close it

00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:53,470
in another view because i want to

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,470
actually add

00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,370
so what I've just added is I've added

00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:15,100
another image and in this case have

00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:17,470
added images a low resolution and the

00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:21,850
URL and have added to the height and the

00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:24,100
sauce so refreshing that now we've got

00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,230
the image out there and I'm sort of a

00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,810
stickler for a little bit more of

00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:31,290
styling so I want everything to kind of

00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:33,910
look like what it did in this particular

00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,440
page so maybe just add a little bit of

00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,320
the border just a deliverer of

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,030
separation so let's do that real quick a

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,150
few things that I'll actually show you a

00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:44,380
few other things so to add that kind of

00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,100
water thing let me just add another

00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,100
style

00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:56,420
so I'm now I'm going to add a border and

00:35:53,810 --> 00:36:00,890
a border with into this whole content

00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:05,480
and I think you're kind of getting the

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:07,040
hang of what um and then when I see got

00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,810
the sort of night got this great board

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,170
around it but everything is sort of like

00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:14,480
hugging on each other so let's see what

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,790
we can do and maybe a way around this is

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,190
to have a separate in each one of these

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,480
tables and to add a separate if you go

00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,940
back to this view there's something that

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,350
it makes available you've gotta start it

00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,820
got a data source if something that

00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,960
renders roll you get accurate you can

00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,850
actually have things that render the

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,550
footer narender the header you can even

00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:33,530
have something that rent as a separator

00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:35,390
so here I've got this render separator

00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,730
function and you can return our function

00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:40,010
and here i say i'm just going to have an

00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:42,410
empty view and a style 20 so think of it

00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:45,290
as just another spacer so if i refresh

00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:47,840
this now you kind of got like a nice to

00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:50,480
you so it was actually pretty quick we

00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:54,440
kind of walk through setting up a pretty

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,060
decent lookin app on iOS and not too

00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,740
long just using style sheets and

00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,540
everything in one place and as you walk

00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,670
through it it's a bit easy to understand

00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:05,270
and if you want to do the same i can

00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:06,800
actually take the same thing and it's

00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,800
not how you would do it but I checked

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,560
you could actually copy the same code

00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,650
into this Android base and see what it

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,590
looks like in spite of Android so here

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,690
we've got to simulate off there I can be

00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:23,140
loaded in JavaScript and here we've got

00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,140
the same

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:30,029
pretty pretty nice in general what you

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,589
probably do is take a lot of the logic

00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:34,619
and separate it out into a different

00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:38,190
file and then refer to it from violence

00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:41,099
or Andrew that's difficult do so let's

00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:43,020
go back to talk about a few other things

00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:45,299
that we want to do but actually before I

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:48,240
do that I just want to say that

00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:49,470
sometimes I've have I kind of gave you

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,789
static content but there's something

00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:54,029
that you could do a little differently

00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:55,829
like instead of say using hard coded

00:37:54,029 --> 00:38:00,299
test data you could love use live data

00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:02,549
and so I'm just going to show you a few

00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:05,490
things I've just dropped in a few few

00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:09,480
pieces of code in here and we're just

00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:13,950
going to walk through a real quick so

00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:16,859
this is the live URL that you can take

00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,539
to access the feed and what I'm doing is

00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:20,640
now I'm going to change to use the live

00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:22,980
URL instead of using this hard coded

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,369
data and the things that I've changed is

00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:29,190
I am now have each component you can

00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:31,109
expose lifecycle method and one of them

00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,029
is a component in mount so component in

00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:35,220
mount is called whenever a proponent is

00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:36,660
sort of attached to the view and in this

00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,670
case I'm calling a function that's

00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:43,410
actually going to make a call to get

00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:46,200
instagram data so we act actually uses

00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:47,730
some of the HTML XHTML request API is

00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,770
like fetch if you're familiar with them

00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,809
so we can call a fetch and then when the

00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:54,750
promise of results you can go ahead and

00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:57,530
check the response and then here check

00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:59,390
if you've got JSON data and here

00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,730
we are actually going to set a

00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:03,170
datasource eventually it's going to go

00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,180
to something similar to what you saw

00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:08,240
before when he had static data so this

00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:10,400
get data store function is just going to

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,950
set the state and cloned and with the

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,960
new data that was received and this is

00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:18,380
one way that you can get a live data so

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:22,100
if i have to now save this and see what

00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,690
it looks like an iOS so now we have like

00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,370
sort of update in common that's life

00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,260
data and this is one way that you can

00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:29,690
actually then it's usually a good thing

00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,280
that when you're actually using react

00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:33,350
when you're sort of testing you I to

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,000
work and sort of like static data until

00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:38,170
you have like you I nice and clean and

00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,760
then start working with life data so

00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:45,650
just finish op sort of like the next

00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:47,150
steps so I showed you XHTML HTTP

00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,410
requests we saw how you can factor daily

00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,600
life there are other ways that you can

00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:52,880
actually get data you can work with past

00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,080
class actually exposes some as an open

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,470
source function where you can actually

00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,000
you know get fast data or send data to

00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:01,190
process another way that you can work

00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,620
with data relay was something that was

00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,970
open source recently if you recall you

00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,650
actually grabbed a lot of data from

00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,660
Instagram but wouldn't it be nice of

00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,280
each component to specify exactly what

00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:12,020
it needed so you're not sending a whole

00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,820
bunch of data down so we didn't really

00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,340
get into the concept of how can you

00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,680
actually query knit and get only what

00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,810
you want and so in this case how we

00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,750
co-located the state information on how

00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:25,280
we coded hated the styles with relay you

00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,099
can also sort of hold it in the query

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,660
that you need

00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:30,569
and then when the whole system with

00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:33,450
really each component can say I want

00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:35,279
only the username and I want only the

00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:37,589
profile picture and then maybe another

00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:39,479
component to say oh I also want this and

00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:41,279
then as it goes up the chain it can make

00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:43,440
a call to get only the information it

00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:45,450
needs so that's kind of like a real nice

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,979
thing but enough time to kind of walk

00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,559
into that but that's something that you

00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:51,599
can you could use so that's actually a

00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:53,369
very quick introduction into what

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,989
reactivated can give you this obviously

00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:56,759
a lot more than what I showed you but

00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:57,989
this is just to give you a taste so

00:40:56,759 --> 00:41:00,470
thank you so much and i'm open to

00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:00,470
