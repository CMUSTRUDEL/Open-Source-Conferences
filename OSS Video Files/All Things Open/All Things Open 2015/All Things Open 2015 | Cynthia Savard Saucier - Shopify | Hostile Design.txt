anyway so here we go so in design school

00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:16,320
we study great design in the hope of

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,170
creating our own if we're lucky we add a

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,330
single three hour long class on user

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,580
experience and the teacher probably

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,480
called that human computer interaction

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,460
and after school we take all the very

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,820
best work that we have done and we put

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,940
that in a beautiful online portfolio the

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,100
rest all the bad projects that we didn't

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,170
completely implemented those that we did

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,410
in a rush or during a single night we

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,420
put that in our archive folder in the

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,039
hope that no one will ever find that

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,750
again and if you're like me actually

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,489
every name that not archived but I

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,050
renamed that something completely

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,789
irrelevant to make sure that even when

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,030
my boyfriend uses my computer you

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,760
wouldn't find that project after school

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,239
all the rest of the projects are easily

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,010
forgotten and forgiven no user will ever

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,820
have to deal with the very bad design

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,220
decisions that I made as a student but

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,869
by focusing and letting us erase all of

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,100
our bad decisions are teachers and

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,470
mentors they neglect to teach us

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,330
something very important what happens

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,509
with that what's the worst that could

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:26,250
happen with the bad design decisions as

00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:28,619
designers and developers we have a lot

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,689
of power on the way users in track and

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,970
use our with well our products and

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,280
designs and with great power comes great

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,710
responsibility to quote my very favorite

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,970
uncle in spider-man it's actually the

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,930
uncle saying that it's different from

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,790
the movie like if you want to be precise

00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:48,090
so what happened to bad design decisions

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,729
a lot of people think that bad design or

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,780
bad product is an ugly product I guess

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,780
that's true in some way

00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,060
but if we look at the top 50 website in

00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,900
the e-commerce website they share one

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:05,119
thing in common and its ugliness they're

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,360
all pretty ugly we can agree on that and

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,989
as far as I know no one dies from a

00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,690
website that is ugly so you shouldn't be

00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:16,940
afraid of trying new stuff and evading

00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,290
even if you're not a designer developing

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,850
things and implementing things online

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,280
with the fear that it might turn out

00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,780
ugly well of course it's better if

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,840
something is beautiful but it's not a

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,880
big deal if it's not there are way other

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,560
other ways that your design and

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,739
decisions can affect people negatively

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,260
and one of them is by being hostile and

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,880
in order to explain what assault design

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,690
is we have to talk a little bit about

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:45,019
affordance so if its shape could talk it

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,540
would tell you up for dance so for

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:48,830
example this is quite literal this

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,380
triangle would tell you that it's a

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,330
triangle and this rectangle would tell

00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:58,910
you that it's a rectangle pretty easy so

00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:01,489
far but if you magically add a border

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,140
radius there and a cool little drop

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,090
shadow all of a sudden like that

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,329
rectangle is begging you for you to

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,730
press it and when something is

00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:15,500
affordable users they don't need

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:18,500
instructions video games are all about

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:22,790
affordance by show of hands who here as

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,260
playing mario bross good those that I've

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,230
never played I'm sorry that reference

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,019
gonna be a bit alien but you should get

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,760
where I'm going so you just knew when

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,590
you were playing that you could jump on

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,140
Koopa Troopa the turtle because it has

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,980
it add a rounded back it wouldn't kill

00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,329
you it didn't need instructions and I

00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,190
can tell that because I'm absolutely

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,200
certain that all of everyone that raised

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,250
their hand no one has ever read the

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,250
instructions before playing

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,640
if you did you would have learned some

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,750
really really interesting first of all

00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,900
you would know that the mushroom is

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:02,250
called little little Goomba who knew

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,500
that honestly okay and that little

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:08,120
Goomba was a mushroom that betrayed the

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,640
Mushroom Kingdom nah and I quote and

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,580
koopa troopa the green turtle was actual

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,049
actually a soldier of the turtle empire

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,190
his orders are to find and destroy Mario

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:23,070
jump on them any steps moving for a

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,070
while so who you marry Oh had such a big

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,540
target on his back seriously an

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:30,570
affordance is not only a digital content

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,280
that we see in video games obviously so

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,080
the same way you knew that you shouldn't

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,810
touch Spinney see I did my research I

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,570
know all the characters in Mario so you

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,040
knew you couldn't touch Spinney you know

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,310
you shouldn't touch a hedgehog in real

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,710
life that was my pet headshot headshot I

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:53,010
could touch it or anything with spikes

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:55,830
for that matter and the hedgehogs they

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:57,360
don't come with instructions I'm just

00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,640
going to stop talking here because

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,460
there's a video it's cute people don't

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,460
listen usually it's not long

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:11,120
so the kit in here obviously doesn't

00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:14,000
like the Hedgehog and the kitten cannot

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,980
read instructions it just knows the

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,740
Hedgehog carries a form factor with its

00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:24,890
spikes knowing that would you sleep on

00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:29,930
that bench so can I ask why does that

00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:32,210
bench a spice if it's a bench or would

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,260
you sleep on any of these benches for

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,790
that matter I know that I wouldn't but

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,710
it's not a big problem for me because I

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,810
have a very comfortable and warm bed

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,860
that is waiting for me every night at my

00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:48,650
place except tonight at the hotel these

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,980
benches were created to restrict it is

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,140
access to a certain cast of society that

00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:59,630
might use them in a certain way that is

00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:02,450
not deemed normal when a designer use

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,360
its knowledge of affordance in order to

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,100
shape interfere or restrict the way a

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,580
certain class of people can use its

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:16,280
object that is called hostel design in

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:19,970
these objects that control who gets to

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,710
use them are quite bad it's easy to say

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,570
that it lacks empathy towards the users

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:29,030
and needs but let's be realistic here it

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:32,720
just mirrors a reflection of the role of

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:36,200
a designer and developer production

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,760
people me as a designer I'm commissioned

00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,270
by a client and that client can be

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,220
internal or external and by definition a

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,140
client as business objectives that might

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:49,010
not always be aligned with the users

00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:51,410
best interest in these cases it is a

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,150
role of the designer and developer to

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,780
advocate for the users best interests

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:59,930
and users need so us all designs sure it

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:03,280
means a lack of empathy but it doesn't

00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,280
come from the designer or developer

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,020
on the web you don't have to read that

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,030
on the web muscle design exists and it's

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,460
referred to as dark patterns it's a

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:19,469
slightly darker version of hustle design

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:22,979
a dark pattern is when a user interface

00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:24,030
is crafted in order to trick the user to

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,530
do something that they wouldn't do

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,819
normally such as buying entrances or

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,879
signing up for recurring service without

00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:35,069
knowing it normally when you think of

00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,509
bad design implementation you think of a

00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:39,300
lousy designer or someone that is

00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:41,009
slightly lazy maybe that is not skilled

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,229
enough not enough experience you don't

00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:46,680
think of designers as being held in tent

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,599
intended but don't get me wrong dark

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,129
patterns are not mistakes they're not

00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,169
made by bad designers they're made by

00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:55,319
designers that really understand how

00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:57,389
people behave online they're crafted

00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,479
with a solid understanding of users

00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:03,930
behaviors so just to give you an example

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,569
that here it's from Royal Mail this is

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,219
hard for me to say so Royal Mail wants

00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,800
you to register to their newsletter

00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:12,569
quite obviously so on the first row it

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,949
asks you and if you don't follow me here

00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,589
at that's normal I read it a couple of

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,300
times it's quite long take the boxes

00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:20,460
relevant to your choice if you do not

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,680
wish to receive any such communication

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,930
so you have to take those that you do

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,879
not wish to receive by post to the phone

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,300
email or SMS that's the first question

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,729
the second question it asks you if you

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,380
do want to receive them take it so if

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,390
you take every single one of them at the

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,490
top row and you take every single one of

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:42,060
them at the bottom row you will receive

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:46,560
all the communications this is pretty

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:48,779
nasty this is what I call the trommel

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,209
net trommel net is a web fishing it's

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,620
like two rows of nuts with big holes and

00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,180
small holes and if the fish doesn't go

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,029
through the first hole it will get stuck

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,740
in the second hole that company if it

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,329
doesn't catch you on the first question

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,769
they surely would get you with the

00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:08,779
second question here's another example

00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:12,180
you guys know the podcast reply hall yay

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,440
so even one of the the host of the

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,390
podcast recently talked about this

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,540
experience using Hindi and there's a

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,210
company online where you

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,310
book a cleaning service they come to

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,400
your place every week two weeks months

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,320
as you wish they make it really easy to

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,360
create accounts like you can do that

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,970
super easily two three questions get a

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,630
price boom done but they make it

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,070
impossible to cancel the service online

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,950
you just can't even if you were to look

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:44,080
all over the Internet you can't cancel a

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:46,450
subscription people are not happy about

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,920
that you can imagine that when you're

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,960
trying to cancel the service and you can

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:57,700
well of course it reduces the churn

00:09:49,960 --> 00:10:01,060
level hi say hello ok so it sure reduces

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,620
the turn level but after that these

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,720
people are really unhappy and they start

00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,600
talking about it these are just like a

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,370
collection that I quickly got on Twitter

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,430
and if you look at the dates these are

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,930
all like 24 hour old AF well when I

00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,270
prepared a presentation they were 24

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,860
hour old tweets and there were a bunch

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,860
of them I just selected a couple of them

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,540
so why do company uses dark patterns why

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,430
do they ask their designers and

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,490
developers to integrate these things

00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,830
that we know are just evil well that's

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,290
because it works it works in the short

00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,150
term if you define your success by how

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,790
many people subscribe to their two-year

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:42,070
newsletter well you're going to be

00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:45,370
successful and you even might receive a

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:48,100
nice bonus for having such great metrics

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,980
and results but the problem is you will

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,140
pay for that and a lot of money actually

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,450
linkedin just recently announced that it

00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,880
would like that it lost a class-action

00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,000
suit and it will give back 13 million

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,650
dollars for sending those terrible email

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,050
that it was sent on your behalf that was

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,220
one of the worst dark pattern ever you

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,840
guys know what I'm talking about when

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,540
you would like everyone's like nodding

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,250
like I sent an email to my uncle that is

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,250
obviously not on linkedin and I don't

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,230
even know how that happened so if your

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,120
designers are DEP designer or a

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:23,070
developer that is being asked to do one

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,510
of these terrible things speak up you

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,200
will save money in the long run and your

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:33,370
company will like you for it

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:35,760
so hustle design it makes might be it

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:39,370
might make people lose money time

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,260
comfort energy but they're definitely

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,800
not the worst that can happen with bad

00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:47,950
design decisions so can design be worse

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:52,990
than hostile and they actually cruel

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:55,420
enough to cause pain obviously can in

00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:04,029
one of the ways it can do that is by

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:06,100
using inadvertent cruel algorithms last

00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:09,820
December facebook launched a new app

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,920
called Year in Review to increase

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,710
engagement they automatically selected

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,320
all the top pictures from your feed and

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,529
to define what was a top picture they

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,150
just look at the amount of likes

00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:25,450
obviously if everyone liked your picture

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:27,850
it must have been nice so they created a

00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,760
holiday theme slideshow with these

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:34,000
pictures while they had genuinely really

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,500
good intention in mind they made a

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,570
mistake of thinking that everyone had a

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,990
great year that they actually wanted to

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:44,050
be reminded of for people that had

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:47,530
experienced pain and loss this served as

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:51,130
a hurtful reminder of the year that they

00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:56,560
had passed here's what your year looked

00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:58,720
liked as it showed balloons and

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,930
streamers around the picture of a loved

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:06,780
one that had passed away that here or

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,780
around your house that burned them

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,329
obviously Facebook designers and

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,339
engineers they don't think they're doing

00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:16,360
badly and I would probably have done the

00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:18,949
same but let's not fool ourselves

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,379
they're not better than you and me and

00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:24,170
we're not better than they are they're

00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:26,360
just the same it is our responsibility

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,769
to ask what's the worst that could

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,589
happen with that feature that I'm

00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:32,839
creating and implementing let's not

00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:34,850
blame the project manager here everyone

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,470
on that team could have seen that could

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,160
have thought of the picture in their

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:42,290
feeds that was not that happy they made

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,869
another mistake that leads me to the

00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:49,209
second point another way you can be

00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:49,209
cruel is by using symbols and emotions

00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:56,209
do people use the like button always for

00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:58,790
really good reasons I would argue that

00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:00,949
not at all so here's a reason why the

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,649
like button is really good I like bacon

00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:10,179
and this bacon mask is surprisingly well

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:14,269
crafted I'm gonna like that that's fine

00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:16,339
it deserves alike so here Jane Doe

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:18,110
announces that she got the results of

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,990
her x-rays and she won't be able to walk

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,990
this summer I can guarantee you that

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,490
this will get some like I've seen people

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,160
announcing they were breaking up getting

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:32,899
likes it loved one that died getting

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,850
likes like it's terrible I'm not stupid

00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:37,670
I know that people that like this don't

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:41,179
actually like this like muhaha like you

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,800
own me walking yay no I know like it's

00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:45,829
just a way to say like I've read this I

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,189
support you I have empathy I have

00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:51,860
compassion and all of that but when Jane

00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:53,420
Doe reads that she won't be walking for

00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,420
that summer and sees that you've liked

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,879
it that doesn't make her feel any better

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,660
I don't think that she sees that as

00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,660
compassion

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:08,070
recently as you may know Facebook

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:10,330
announced a new feature called reactions

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,290
it's meant as a way for people to

00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:15,070
express empathy beyond the like button

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:19,210
basically to avoid these other

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:22,900
situations that we saw before Zuckerberg

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:25,120
actually said and I quote it's a way of

00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,940
sharing compassion when a thumbs up is

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,160
socially inappropriate fair enough I

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,320
salute that I actually think it's a

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,690
really good idea and good job Facebook

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,830
for making Facebook and more socially

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:44,710
appropriate place but I'd like to

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:47,560
express some concerns here Oh first your

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:52,140
brain no longer knows the difference

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:55,450
between emoticons and emotions just

00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,100
going to repeat that your brain doesn't

00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:01,090
know the difference between a smiling

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,520
face in a smiley face some researchers

00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:07,300
actually have shown you see the tub

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,810
grinder that's the occipital temporal

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,190
section that's also very hard to say

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,690
that's a region that the region that has

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,480
the most activity when you see a smiley

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,980
face second brain there the region that

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,260
has the most activity when you see a

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,840
smiling face which is basically very

00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,840
very similar and if you want to compare

00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:28,740
the show they showed I think it's a sale

00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,180
I don't know how you call that actually

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:36,410
any idea like

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:38,420
I home mm-hmm that icon so just a random

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,790
icon like you totally see the difference

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:45,589
between these three these two different

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,610
cases so why is that a problem well

00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:47,570
let's just say it's a problem because

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,060
your brain doesn't make a difference

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,160
between a yellow thing in a face that's

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,470
one part but the other thing is that

00:16:52,160 --> 00:17:00,589
Facebook suggests a single type of

00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:04,069
happiness by reducing every emotion to a

00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:07,270
simplistic emoji we diminishes the

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:12,130
spectrum of reactions that we can feel

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:12,130
we may remove the possibility of humor

00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:28,940
sarcasm death compassion even love it

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:32,059
renders empathy a mere click away so

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,190
let's see this situation here a friend

00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:37,280
of yours announced that she finally

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:41,360
feels better after a year in a 30 year

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,740
after a week of being sick I'm guessing

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,740
you're pretty happy so you're like yay

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:53,179
express any company I'm compassion here

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:55,130
i'd go for you at least later she

00:17:53,179 --> 00:18:00,200
announces that she just got the job that

00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:05,210
she always dreamt of what do you do yeah

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:08,540
year can you make this smiley any bigger

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:11,750
you can't that's fine like that's not

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,550
big deal later that week she announces

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,340
that she's finally pregnant that's a

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,929
reason she was sick you're actually

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,490
generally super happy for your friends

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,600
so what do you do he explodes that

00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,600
smiley face huh

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:30,530
when you read happiness in a face there

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,680
are dozens of micro expressions that

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,900
help well there are dozens of micro

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,070
expressions that help understanding the

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:42,980
meaning of what you're expressing when

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,990
you're using words you use techniques to

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,920
reproduce that you use synonyms you use

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:51,020
metaphors example all of this add

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,830
nuances and context helping you to

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:58,100
express and define the way you react to

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,650
something but when your only option is a

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,850
smiley face what do you do do you really

00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:07,070
think that people will comment on it

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:09,230
maybe they will I guess we'll see how

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,120
people will react with these new

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:13,250
features but my guess is that we will

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:19,010
see more and more reaction unless unless

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:20,990
comments so talking of likes and symbols

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:24,140
and icons Facebook is clearly not the

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,940
only one using these icons my this is a

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:30,650
screenshot from my mail app on my

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:33,620
computer so in order to put something to

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:40,070
my junk folder see here a linkedin email

00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:41,780
i have to dislike it that's fair for

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:45,140
LinkedIn cuz i actually do dislike yet

00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:48,350
saw i don't really mind later that week

00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,980
I received my baking my credit card

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:54,200
banking statement and it went in my junk

00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,730
folder so i actually have to like my

00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,940
credit card banking statement in order

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,580
for it to go in my inbox you can guess

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,090
that i do not like my banking my credit

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:09,230
card banking statement not at all let's

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:11,180
not mix something here there's a motion

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,100
towards the content of that email and

00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,950
there's an action that is literally just

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,430
a change of state it's a number in a

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:23,290
database let's not use emotions to

00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,290
reflect a change of database

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,380
but it's just an icon right how

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:33,460
important are these words and icons that

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:36,789
we put on buttons I would argue that

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:41,289
they're very important this is Airbnb

00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:43,779
and not too long ago a couple of years

00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:45,700
ago actually they changed their star

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:48,850
system they had the star rating system

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,220
to hearts and the result of that was a

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:56,260
staggering thirty percent increase in

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:58,360
conversion the star is just a regular

00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,940
favorite rating system but the heart

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,799
carries in motion the heart shows that

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,130
you might like something you might dream

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,899
of something it's aspirational so by

00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:13,659
just making that symbol change they saw

00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:17,110
that huge increase in number so ask

00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:19,149
yourself is the word or icon on that

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:23,169
button really reflecting what the user

00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:26,190
experience is experiencing ask yourself

00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:26,190
why might the darker now

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:37,030
another way design candy Crowell is by

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:39,370
oversight when the design when the

00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:41,740
designers when the developers forget I

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:45,460
use a scenario in the development of

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:48,670
their app a colleague of mine recently

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:53,500
lived firsthand how design can be

00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:54,850
incredibly cruel she was at work and she

00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,880
received a phone call during your lunch

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,410
meeting and it was her father announcing

00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,300
that her sister that had been battling

00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,890
cancer for a couple of years was in a

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:07,540
critical state and they didn't know how

00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:11,290
long she had to go so my friend lives in

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:13,440
Ottawa Canada and her friend was in

00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:17,470
Toronto friend or sister was in Toronto

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:21,940
that's 450 kilometers and that is 280

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:25,750
miles I've checked so driving their

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,820
attacks up to five hours she didn't know

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:31,090
how long your sister had to still could

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:34,680
live so while she was in the car she

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,680
received a phone call through facetime

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:41,740
her sister called her to say goodbye our

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,910
last words were delivered through

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:51,030
facetime and this gives me goosebumps it

00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:54,070
blows my mind my friend I she said I'm

00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,930
grateful that technology has evolved so

00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,300
that I was able to have those critical

00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:01,450
moments through this small device in my

00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,700
pocket this is something that would have

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:09,430
never been possible just a couple of

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:12,180
years ago however while she was actually

00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,180
talking to her sister

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:19,090
her phone call got cut short there was

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,610
an error message saying the name of her

00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,610
sister is not available for facetime i

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:31,650
remember when facebook launched based on

00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:34,270
well when kapil launch face i'm sorry

00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:36,460
there was a commercial showing happy

00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:43,289
friends sending happy messages to other

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:43,289
atty friends that was found here but

00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,309
what do you think you like it

00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:36,450
every day more people connect

00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:42,090
face-to-face on the iphone than any

00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:44,070
other phone take a moment to reflect on

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:49,470
the most important phone call in your

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:53,519
life was it a job interview over the

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:57,299
phone your sister telling you that she's

00:24:53,519 --> 00:25:01,409
pregnant asking your wife to marry you

00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:05,000
because you're deployed learning that

00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:08,309
your friend is in a car accident I

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,320
imagine knowingly saying goodbye to your

00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:17,490
sister and getting cut short by a

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:20,309
message not available for facetime what

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:22,679
does that even mean is there a

00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:24,750
connection issue you need do you need to

00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:29,490
change any settings you're in the car

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:31,110
driving you're stuck on your side of the

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:33,480
screen with nothing else that you can do

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:38,610
except blame yourself for not being able

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:41,909
to understand that technology I know

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:45,590
that people working on FaceTime they

00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:45,590
just didn't imagine that user scenario

00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,250
but there are things they could have

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:53,700
done to avoid that and we're going to

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:55,500
talk about that later but when you get

00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,230
these messages this is when you

00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,570
understand that this error message is

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:04,529
designed it's something that can be

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,600
thought plan and changed you can design

00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,309
for errors you can design for death you

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:12,899
can design for all these scenarios as

00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:16,380
long as you think of them so design can

00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:20,149
be hostile it can cause pain it can be

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,149
worse it can be deadly

00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:31,200
design can kill and not in a

00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:33,590
metaphorical way when you say next time

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,900
i see comic song I'll kill someone or

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:41,550
when God kills kitten or whoever is

00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:44,520
killing kitten I should design can kill

00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:46,200
in a very serious way in our office

00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,750
there is a wiki page that outlines the

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,540
emergency procedures in case of the fire

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,430
in that page we learned that there are

00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,780
two types of alarms it's very small and

00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,060
just telling you through that so two

00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,890
types of alarms first one is you should

00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:02,400
get ready to leave but don't leave yet

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:07,560
might be a false alarm second one is get

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,390
the out so we're gonna play a

00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,800
little game here I'm gonna play one of

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,830
the two sounds I'm not telling you which

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:16,260
one and by of show up n you have to kick

00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,990
you have to tell me should we leave

00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,450
right now or should we stay and continue

00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:23,900
working because it's yet another false

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,100
alarm because they happen all the time

00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:40,140
so I'm going to try to do this let me

00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:49,470
know if you hear shovin who rushes

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:54,210
through the door oh you died so this is

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:56,490
a terrible design someone thought we're

00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,110
gonna make two different alarms that no

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,570
one will ever hear at the same time to

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:03,080
compare and this is gonna be the

00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:06,540
emergency warn that should little like

00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,530
that the like

00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,809
so a good thing that has never been a

00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,790
fire and in the office but I made a

00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:14,470
point of telling everyone that if you

00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:21,280
hear in a lot alarm that doesn't sound

00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:27,340
like an alarm just run so here's another

00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:30,000
example in 2007 I was backpacking across

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,440
Central America as a young girl

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,680
discovering the world its beauties and

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:40,150
hidden secrets I was traveling with my

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:43,840
very good friend Fred in Guatemala in

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:46,120
order to see all of the hidden gems we

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,690
went to that hostel that it's hotel

00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:52,330
hostile not sure called hey yo Dulce and

00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:56,140
in order to get there we had to take a

00:28:52,330 --> 00:29:00,300
boat ride of 15 minutes the next morning

00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:05,050
we have breakfast and we'd cereals that

00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:07,390
contains alna that contains almonds you

00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:09,850
probably have guessed right now that

00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:13,630
fred is allergic to nuts very allergic

00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:15,160
thankfully yet is inject her with him he

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,740
always travel with it I knew it I knew

00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,260
where it was so I run to get it what I

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:24,010
did not know is that once once you start

00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:26,410
having an allergic reaction you spasm so

00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:30,460
his hands we're stuck and he couldn't

00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:32,650
open them so he told me Cynthia you have

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,059
to inject me and the only thing i knew

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,590
and the only thing that i've been told

00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:37,330
is like when you inject someone you

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,670
think a big orange and you plug it in

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,990
and it all works magically and I've

00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,400
always been told as well that I

00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,929
shouldn't do it on someone else the

00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,590
person that is allergic should always

00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:51,220
inject themselves so I gave him the

00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,990
injection and it worked but an injection

00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:57,840
works for 10 minutes and we were 15

00:29:52,990 --> 00:30:01,000
minutes away from the clinic so 10

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,240
awfully long minutes later were on the

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,510
boat getting to the hospital and I know

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,890
that I have to give in the second dose

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:11,140
so this was not a big pan that has a

00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,450
single dose it was called dual Jack that

00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:17,669
had two doses

00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:22,960
I try to give him and it didn't work

00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:25,840
imagine this i'm on a boat that is

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,000
rushing going ridiculously fast the

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,059
water is bumpy that my hair is actually

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,549
like whipping my face there are two

00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:36,070
tourists on that boat with us are

00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:39,370
freaking out the two are screaming and

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:41,080
yelling the boat driver is yelling at me

00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:47,230
in spanish things that i do not

00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:49,059
understand and my friend asked one of

00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:54,580
the tourists to hold this ends while is

00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:56,110
trying to breathe I'm trying to stay

00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:00,519
calm and I resign myself to read

00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:04,470
instructions this is not like in ikea

00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,470
instructions it should be easier to read

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:17,429
so I enrolled instructions and I read

00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:17,429
slide the orange color of the plunger

00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,430
I remember feeling really mad at myself

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,420
for not being able to understand what

00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:30,920
that meant disclaimer I studied plastic

00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:34,710
injection in industrial design in school

00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,580
and I was baffled by the way that I just

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:44,400
wouldn't understand what they were

00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:46,020
telling me to do I panicked and out of

00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:52,020
options I start stabbing my friend with

00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:54,930
the syringe 11 times exactly and the

00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:58,350
11-time the syringe broke in the plastic

00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:59,970
cracked open and i can tell you very

00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:03,510
magically i don't know how that happened

00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:10,260
but it worked I had just save my

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:13,980
friend's life out of pure panic let me

00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,740
tell you something if I had wanted to

00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,590
save lives in my life I would have chose

00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:22,380
a very different career path I might

00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:28,410
have become a surgeon a doctor a nurse

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:32,390
paramedic not a designer I think that's

00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,390
what I told myself before that day

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,260
before I save my friend's life

00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:44,970
thankfully fred is fine right now but it

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:48,570
could have gone wrong because of a

00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:53,460
terrible terrible design

00:32:48,570 --> 00:33:00,299
decision I know now because i went

00:32:53,460 --> 00:33:01,740
online on youtube and look for it and it

00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:06,110
sounds stupid when you look at it that

00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:11,909
way all I had to do is pop that little

00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:14,010
yellow thing and maybe I couldn't find

00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:17,539
it because the instructions said that it

00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:21,620
was orange and it was actually yellow

00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:23,850
maybe because it was a step nine of

00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,039
instructions written really small on

00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,380
paper around the tube and I was on water

00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:30,330
it was wet and someone was screaming to

00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:37,320
me in spanish and two girls were crying

00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:38,880
and my friend was dying maybe also

00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,320
because i just thought that that plastic

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,320
part was part of the injector

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,149
so what do you do to save people lives

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:54,700
as designers developers content

00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:57,470
strategists and UX researchers first

00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:04,270
let's write really clear instructions

00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:07,880
and error messages make sure you include

00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:11,119
every instruction every possible

00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:18,230
troubleshooting information and always

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:22,270
include the next steps second try to do

00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:22,270
testing with different emotional states

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:27,020
it's hard to test for panic you're

00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:30,379
obviously not going to make panic your

00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:32,720
testers that would be terrible but we

00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:36,589
always test during users usability

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,599
testing and we start by saying take your

00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:42,169
time are you comfortable would you like

00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,659
some water don't worry you cannot make a

00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:47,359
mistake if you make a mistake it's my

00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:49,879
mistake it's not yours we go above and

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,379
beyond to make the tester feel super

00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:56,680
comfortable to avoid the lab effect

00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:59,270
would we get valuable and very different

00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,339
insights if we were to tell the tester

00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:05,990
no rush but you have five minutes to

00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:09,310
complete that task I think so why not do

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,310
it you'd save money

00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:20,230
third let's ask ourself what's the worst

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:25,780
that could happen with what I'm doing

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:28,540
building implementing right now here's a

00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,609
table for those I can't see it it goes

00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,349
from few of the people some of the

00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:34,900
people most of the people all of the

00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:36,940
people and the other axis says very

00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,359
little at the time to all of the time

00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:42,490
and this is generally how we create and

00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:48,210
prioritize different features when we

00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:48,210
build a new software website whatever

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:55,660
whatever is used most of the time is

00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:58,900
prioritized what is whatever is used few

00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:02,079
of the time by few of the people is the

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:04,089
prioritize now if you gather your team

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,910
and you brainstorm and ask yourself wait

00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:09,670
could someone die from this and the

00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:13,210
answer is that it could hurt a single

00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:18,700
user well maybe you should reprioritize

00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:21,579
your backlog it is okay to be annoying

00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:26,280
to one hundred percent of your users if

00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:26,280
it's in order to save a single life

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,220
users feeling emotions and lives should

00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:38,559
always triumph a deadline a budget and a

00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:40,630
feature for example here's tumblr asking

00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,819
a person for cert a person that is

00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:46,150
search look a person that is searching

00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:49,270
for sadness or sad it's telling it would

00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:51,130
you like some help this is a very good

00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:54,910
example it might be useless to most

00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:57,010
people but if it saved a single life I'm

00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:59,700
willing to give money to that content

00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,700
strategist there

00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,420
fourth

00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:12,760
can we stop saying users let's start

00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:17,579
let's start saying people people they

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:21,250
don't submit forms they apply for jobs

00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:23,500
they don't click the like button they're

00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:29,380
generally happy because of that bacon

00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:34,539
mask finally people they don't convert

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:36,670
that's my favorite they don't convert

00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:38,980
the purchase gifts they purchase auto

00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,020
parts food for their cats they do all

00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,079
that online they're not converting when

00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:46,420
they're doing that and in order to

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:55,210
design for the people will just become

00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:59,349
the people research ask questions use

00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:02,200
your own product you will never regret

00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:05,770
from having too much information on the

00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:08,650
way people behave online observing

00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:10,750
people testing survey's everyone is

00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,970
responsible for that not only UX

00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:20,140
researchers and that is if you're lucky

00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:24,809
enough to have one humans are very

00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:30,099
complex beings they're able to feel a

00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:34,450
multitude of emotions designing for

00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:38,529
empathy they say that's very trendy but

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:43,329
what does that even mean what emotions

00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:48,279
are we really designing for as designers

00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:51,520
developers product creators we choose

00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:55,829
selectively what emotion we're designing

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,829
for and we ignore the rest

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,700
any engineers there

00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,910
Engineers they have a ritual in Canada

00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:16,570
and in the States if i'm not mistaken

00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:22,670
where they receive a ring at graduation

00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:24,830
you know the story behind that ring so

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:28,400
in the 1900s during the construction of

00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:31,550
the Quebec bridge the bridge collapsed

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,930
killing 75 people most of them were

00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:38,810
workers the collapse was due to an error

00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:42,880
of judgment from the engineer that

00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:45,740
designed that bridge the myth says that

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,880
the first rings were actually made from

00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:53,000
the iron of that bridge it was a it was

00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,460
just a way to symbolize humility and a

00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,250
reminder to your responsibility to the

00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:05,960
public here's my question to you what is

00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:08,690
your ring what will you do what will you

00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,330
find what will you carry around with you

00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:14,590
every day in order to remind yourself

00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:14,590
that you might kill someone one day

00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,609
