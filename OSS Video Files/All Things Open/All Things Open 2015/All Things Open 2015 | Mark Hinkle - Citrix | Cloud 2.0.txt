my name is Mark Hinkel there is

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,740
originally another gentleman named Tom

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,540
from brocade that was supposed to be

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,880
here to give the SDN talk I'm not going

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,980
to be able to give that talk in and do

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,840
it justice but what I did was I talked

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,740
to the people to open daylight I got

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,689
their latest briefing deck and I was

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,880
somewhat prepared to give a short talk

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,239
when Sen and then I'm going to do the

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,540
cloud to dotto talk that Todd announced

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,930
earlier today so if you guys were here

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,280
for a long sdn talk and you want to go

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,649
see something else you're not going to

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,989
hurt my feelings that URL that's up

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,190
there now SlideShare / socialized

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,680
software has the update has a 30 slide

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,719
deck on open daylight with some updates

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,629
and the latest release I'm going to go

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,079
over at a very high level I am NOT

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,579
steeped in sdn and open daylight in the

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,430
way that I'd like to be to give the talk

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,290
so sorry for those of you that were

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,280
hoping to get sdn but we're going to

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:15,630
talk about cloud we're going to talk

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:19,740
about networking as well so this is the

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,960
this is what's uploaded to SlideShare my

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,670
name is Mark Hinkel i work at citrix i

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,490
work in there i run their open source

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:32,220
business office so citrix has

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:35,340
initiatives and open daylight apache

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,350
cloudstack then server etc tom was

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,340
supposed to give the talk he's sick

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:45,000
you're stuck with me these are the

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,130
slides as i said earlier will touch a

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,079
little bit on that will also talk about

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,000
sdn today so sdn the reason that it's

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,460
interesting is it's the level of

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,740
abstraction around networking so if you

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,710
look at servers and storage we've had

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,030
abstractions for a long time in the

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,700
networking world we've been more

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,500
physically bound probably with the

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,140
exception of something like open D

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,200
switch which is a software switch that

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,890
allows you to

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,720
Bridge crossed hosts and the reason that

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,730
people are interested in it is it allows

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,950
the same Allah amount of automate it

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,170
provides a platform for you to automate

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,120
things and have dynamic networks in the

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,830
same way that you have dynamic cloud

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,950
infrastructure for computing storage

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,690
today as you can tell I'm more on the

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,459
server side then I'm on the network side

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:38,500
so that's why I make these analogies but

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:42,730
basically in a nutshell what you're

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,140
doing is you're with Sdn is separating

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,049
the control plane and the data plane

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,250
giving you the ability to interact via

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:56,640
API and do interesting things with

00:02:50,250 --> 00:03:01,120
networking so this is sort of sort of a

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,430
simple abstraction the network shows the

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,989
application layer your control layer you

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,390
interact with them and allow you to

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:10,510
control the data plane going through

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,430
these different devices one of the

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,069
things that you probably will run into

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:18,160
when you talked about software-defined

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:21,160
networking is open flow it's an open

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,549
standard sort of developed at Stanford I

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:29,190
believe giving you the ability to

00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:29,190
control your network devices remotely

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:41,079
got open V switch if envy switch is a a

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,910
switch that allows you to that really

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,010
became popular because you had these

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,769
virtualized servers and all of a sudden

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,600
you had multiple virtual machines that

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,910
were bridging across servers it gives

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,260
you some software switching across the

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:57,910
servers and you could google that I

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,370
really am NOT going to do this justice

00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,230
if I go into too much detail what

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,910
opendaylight is is it's an industry

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,810
consortium and in its industry

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:10,480
consortium that is located in the Linux

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,819
Foundation Linux Foundation brought all

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,760
these different organizations together

00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,470
to create a common controller so that we

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,680
can instrument or networks to the

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,590
control plane consistently and not have

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,610
to duplicate F

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:27,889
and it's pretty much a who's who of the

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,720
networking industry a lot of the

00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:34,760
original code came from places like

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:39,290
Cisco and IBM so that's just in a

00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,120
nutshell if I go through here here's

00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,630
sort of the industry leaders the

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,880
brocades cisco citrix ericsson HP Intel

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,490
Red Hat you can read the logos is just

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,620
as well as I've but the idea is that

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,840
nope and source you want to you want to

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,250
commoditize something that adds little

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,310
incremental value you want to develop

00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,050
things that don't exist and add value

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,240
further up the sacked sort of like the

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,340
Linux kernel everybody in the industry

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,040
who around Linux is collaborating on the

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,830
colonel and then they work on things

00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:14,690
like management assigning the binaries

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:21,500
etc to add value of the stack so that

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:24,590
was my horrible five seconds on sdn this

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,800
is something I do know a lot about and I

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,570
have a lot of opinions on and its really

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,010
an SDN factors into this I mean I think

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,500
VMware has done a good if you read any

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,690
of their stuff on the software-defined

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,360
data center does a good idea talking

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:44,300
about how how data center should look

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,780
and what it's becoming what is evolving

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,900
to software-defined networking is one

00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,190
part of that virtualization and

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,340
virtualized storage etc as part of that

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,410
and it's enabled even further by things

00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,460
like containers and micro services and

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:04,460
if in source software so all right told

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:09,080
you who I am these slides are on

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:15,370
SlideShare so I've been doing this cloud

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:18,710
stuff since about 2006-2007 when Amazon

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:22,010
first lodged ec2 i worked in

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,389
virtualization before that and the the

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,490
place where i spent most of my time

00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:27,770
around cloud was as a company called

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,260
cloud calm and we developed something

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,700
called a patchy cloud stack so I spent a

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,190
lot of time personally on Patchi

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,810
cloudstack but I kept looking at all the

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,460
competitor

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,950
and what everybody else was doing and

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,540
having MV of things that Amazon was

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,750
doing because they did an awesome job of

00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,510
defining cloud but this is sort of what

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,000
I talked about back in the day 2012 I

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,580
talked about public cloud stuff running

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,430
in your in their data center I talked

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,470
about private cloud stuff running in our

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,190
data centers and then I talked about

00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:02,830
hybrid cloud stuff moving back and forth

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:05,919
now there used to be a joke at that time

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,919
about hybrid cloud hybrid cloud was like

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,260
sex in high school everybody's talking

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,060
about it and nobody's doing it to this

00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,919
day I sort of feel like that's the way

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,110
it is i think workloads exist in

00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,510
different places but i don't see people

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,760
massively moving workloads back and

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,950
forth from amazon to their OpenStack or

00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,380
their vcloud or their patchy cloud stack

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:32,139
or whatever I feel like they manage

00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:35,290
clouds across different locations this

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:37,720
is sort of how things evolved back in

00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,280
the early early days conceptually I

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,680
think the people that talked about so ax

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,770
we're talking about the cut where we

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,530
were going but there was a lack of tools

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,220
and enablement for them to do Stan

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,120
service oriented architecture

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,789
holistically the way we can do the

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,560
things today basically it was coming

00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,520
things were developed in her in data

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,919
center by single product vendors etc

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,840
then in about two thousand six and I

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:08,320
forgot my glasses so if I make updates

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:11,610
just nod and laugh 2006 amazon launched

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,440
dc2 and things started to change google

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,580
launched App Engine and all of a sudden

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,050
we started to see the beginnings of

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:24,490
public cloud short 2010 you started to

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:26,350
see open source cloud vendors like patch

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,850
cloud com at the time Apache CloudStack

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:33,010
now eucalyptus OpenStack starting to

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,599
gain traction and interest because

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,360
people said hey this Amazon is really

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,770
cool I don't know if I want my stuff in

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,089
their data center so I want to do it my

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:44,569
datacenter

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:47,269
then 2013 we started to see an

00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:50,170
interesting tool set evolved around

00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:52,399
containers containers aren't a new idea

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:56,329
containers are something that you've

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,370
seen in Solaris you know there's other

00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:00,230
implementations of containers other than

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,110
docker but how many people here have

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,639
heard of dr. you go to a tech conference

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,339
today as doctor doctor doctor doctor

00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,720
doctor and for good reason it's an

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:14,990
interesting and important technology

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:18,230
then last year we saw a pivotal release

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,970
Cloud Foundry as a industry wide

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,139
platform as a service I think that's

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,050
interesting because that's an

00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:27,920
abstraction for application level

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:31,970
deployment paz or as Josh McElveen said

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,670
yesterday pizza is a service which is an

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,249
interesting analogy and then finally

00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,680
this year you start to see other things

00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:41,870
like bieber google releasing cuber need

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,089
ease into its own foundation to become

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,360
an industry-wide effort how many people

00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:49,300
here have heard of cuban EDS okay hew

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,170
Burney DS is an Orchestrator that

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,439
orchestrates containers allows

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:57,339
containers to be scheduled sort of like

00:09:53,439 --> 00:10:00,350
amazon schedules virtual machines in ec2

00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:04,370
so here's the thing that's different

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:06,800
from 1995 to now we're in this era of

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,800
what I call cloud abundance back in the

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,620
day IBM IBM is great because they have

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,589
the ability and the resources to think

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,970
20 years ahead so they said yeah this

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:19,639
Scylla thing that's the way it's going

00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:23,420
to be you know a lot of the terminology

00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:26,509
and the design patterns of so ax are

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,850
being implemented today in design and

00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:31,759
micro services and the way that we think

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:35,569
about cloud unfortunately when they had

00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:40,339
that vision there wasn't a abundance of

00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:42,439
cloud tools cloud services cloud

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:46,480
software allows you to do that or even

00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:50,319
clouds so that's what's different and

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,730
just to my point about cloud growth and

00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:55,040
abundance this is where we're at today

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,860
you just just a hockey stick

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,230
twenty percent year-over-year growth and

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,089
services consumed in cloud not to

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,560
mention the stuff that we're doing in

00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:10,009
our end data center that we don't manage

00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,410
so so this is how i'm going to set up

00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:14,540
today i'm going to talk about where we

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:18,019
started and how its evolving and where

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,759
we're going so cloud 1 dot 0 and I sort

00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:22,639
of made reference to this earlier that

00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:25,399
that back in 2010 a lot of companies

00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,949
were trying to emulate what Amazon was

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,930
doing in the cloud call them copy clap

00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:32,720
copycat clouds I don't mean that to be

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,180
pejorative I just mean that they were

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,399
trying to emulate amazon within their

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,029
and data centers present company

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:44,269
included i worked very hard to try and

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:46,220
emulate amazon AP is unfortunately

00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:49,310
amazon was a hundred billion dollar

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,810
company with amazing resources and they

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,300
were going towards one target of a

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,329
hosted cloud versus me trying to run it

00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:01,279
on data centers along with eucalyptus

00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:02,839
which has since been bought by HP and HP

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:09,110
cloud compute which at the time was

00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:10,760
OpenStack now that's known as helium and

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,290
back in those days we said yes we're

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,430
going to do amazon but we're also going

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:19,250
to do our own cloud and there's a really

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:21,589
good smart guy who his name's adrian

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,310
cockcroft who built the cloud at netflix

00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:28,279
and netflix and he used to liken this to

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,110
rim and riding so you're trying to keep

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,990
yourself on the amazon cloud for certain

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,209
stuff you're trying to keep yourself on

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:37,970
your private cloud whether at that time

00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:39,829
if it was eucalyptus or VMware vCloud or

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,380
whatever it was it was really difficult

00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:45,139
he said you know what Netflix strategy

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,579
is it's all going to Amazon because then

00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,430
we only have one cloud to manage and

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:52,430
what they did was they they used amazon

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,740
to grow their business so netflix the

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:57,709
way they grew across the world is if

00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,600
amazon how to data center there they

00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,310
would enter a geography if amazon didn't

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,920
have a data center there they didn't

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,079
enter the geography and they they're

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,900
openly started an open source program in

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,850
their open source program

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,010
to recreate the same things that amazon

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,320
was doing it was to create tools to make

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,080
them more effective at using Amazon so

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,130
that's a good strategy of developing

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,900
what didn't exist and innovating there

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,150
commoditizing everything amazon

00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,010
commoditize the cloud for them they want

00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:30,070
to begin go into bulgaria and bulgaria

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,510
had a data center it looked the same way

00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,610
it did in the United States and Great

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,100
Britain and everywhere else so there is

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,800
a very marginal cost to them going into

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,230
a new geography and that's what helped

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,250
propel them to be the cloud juggernaut

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:48,040
juggernaut that they are today and

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,440
during this time we we all we really

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,350
talked about cloud with very specific

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,300
labels you have a public cloud do you

00:13:53,350 --> 00:14:00,040
have a private cloud you have a hybrid

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:04,120
cloud and what we did was would say all

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,010
it had to fit these parameters and we

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,560
have a public cloud strategy we have a

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:14,320
private cloud strategy at a time it sort

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:16,110
of made sense not so much today we're

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,430
getting to a place where it's just cloud

00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:23,500
talk a little bit about that so now

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:27,400
we're sort of in that end of what I call

00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,050
cloud 15 error and this is what happened

00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,900
this is I'm going to a tribute to this

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:35,260
is simon word lease graph of cloud

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,910
adoption in the enterprise and I worked

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,400
for an enterprise vendor I work for a

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,290
start-up and we go talk to enterprise

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,870
people and we say what do you think

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:46,690
about cloud it's just for these facebook

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:50,020
kids that's just for the Twitter kids

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:53,410
and it's just for the ebays in the

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,760
paypals it's not really for us then all

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:58,480
of a sudden in the last couple years

00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,730
every Enterprise CIO that I talk to

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,970
they're like yeah number one priorities

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,860
cloud strategy like yeah playing

00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,740
catch-up because it is a real thing and

00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:12,480
it has real benefits and it's stable and

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:15,460
secure and valuable too many many more

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,450
enterprises other than twitter facebook

00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,400
etc

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:23,910
the other thing that's happened in this

00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,720
one dot five era is abundance of cloud

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:33,570
tools so how many people here use puppet

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:35,070
chef salts dacor ansible okay how many

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:39,870
people have used them for more than five

00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:43,860
years okay puppet you could have all the

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:46,770
other saltstack ansible etc there there

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,540
knew the Hashi corp tools like vagrant

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,690
for development environments and Packer

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,850
for image packaging these things are all

00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,860
relatively new but these are good tools

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,900
these are actually tools that are of as

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,630
good a caliber or better than things

00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,580
that IBM management would have sold you

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,590
in the past or BMC would have sold you

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,680
in the past or CA and their innovative

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:09,120
because they move at a high speed and

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,070
they're informed by the users that are

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,760
actually using them that's one of the

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:17,430
big benefits of open source that I think

00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,050
people overlook is I work for a

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,730
commercial company and we have

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,180
professional engineers who write great

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,860
code the problem is they aren't solving

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:29,390
their own problems they're solving other

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:32,280
people's problems so they lack context

00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:35,190
users on the other hand usually are

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,680
solving a problem that affects them very

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:40,020
personally they have great context also

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,270
an open source a lot of time users do

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,520
not write the best code so what you're

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,490
trying to do is provide a way for the

00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,310
context to come from the users and the

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:53,130
engineers who are good at writing code

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,350
to help them streamline that code and

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:57,510
it's good product that's why open source

00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,390
is interesting and effective in my

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,130
opinion so now you have these tools so I

00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,230
talked about the configuration

00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,510
management in the automation tools where

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:10,560
things from bitnami is like a packaging

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:14,250
tool for cloud images Red Hat has there

00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,069
a managed IQ vault is a hachey cork tool

00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:20,910
that allows you to share secrets across

00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:23,069
clouds really Mitchell Hashimoto who

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,230
started hachey Corp is just brilliant

00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,220
all his tools seemed to like take off

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,890
like wildfire and it's got a good

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,679
good eye for what those problems were

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:35,049
and turning them into products and then

00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:38,380
open sourcing them to allow people to to

00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:39,820
tell them how to make him better the

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,490
other thing that changed is so we had

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,679
these we had tools and we had people

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,929
that are interested in it and all of a

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:51,340
sudden you started to see a change in

00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:54,669
culture so how many people here know dev

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,580
have heard of DevOps how many would say

00:17:54,669 --> 00:18:03,030
they work at a place where DevOps

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:05,740
practices are used cool that's good so

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:08,470
the guy in the center it's Patrick

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,840
Dubois is the godfather of DevOps he's

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:15,039
the guy that coined it he's a system

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:17,230
administrator that lives in Belgium out

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,770
in the country and Patrick started

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:24,549
talking about how the culture around how

00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:27,570
you managed IT and develop IT is just as

00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:31,450
important as the technology that you use

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:34,570
then Jean Kim anybody here read the

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,270
Phoenix project okay Phoenix project is

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:41,169
was one of the best-selling books last

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:43,240
two years in management and the thing

00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:45,280
that's interesting is he took the idea

00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,490
of DevOps and applied it to a fictional

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,470
company and showed how DevOps practices

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:56,260
helped or lack of DevOps communication

00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:58,750
hurt a business's productivity and then

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:03,299
you get netflix I think Netflix is just

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:06,909
the great poster child of how you know

00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:09,039
the mat is a manifestation of how DevOps

00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:11,350
works you know the developers and

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,070
operations people talk together they

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,630
have you know shared responsibility for

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,580
keep getting things to production and

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:22,179
keeping it up they have good

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:24,460
communication they iterate fast they

00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:27,100
have they have process but that process

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,870
is an onerous and there's a it's sort of

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,080
a blameless thing it's one of the things

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:36,190
I really like about DevOps is one of my

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,570
friends used to run Amazon's web the

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,610
front end all the web properties his

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:43,630
name was Jesse Robbins he used to be

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:45,880
chef or Opscode at the time when he was

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:49,179
there and they talked about how they do

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,670
their their post mortems and it's a

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:54,309
blameless you know why did this go bad

00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:56,080
and you know how should it how should we

00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:59,380
do it so we don't get bad it wasn't Bob

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,170
messed this up it's you know we checked

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,900
out the Grom code or we didn't run unit

00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,730
test against stuff or whatever it is the

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,590
other thing that they did was they they

00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:14,559
do things like k and netflix netflix

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:18,130
tool called khaya chaos monkey I work

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,410
for the first international ISP back in

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,179
the 90s and if you would have told me

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,820
that we're going to just randomly turn

00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:31,900
stuff off and see how that works to test

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:35,500
our resiliency I would have fired you at

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:38,740
Amazon and Netflix they run chaos monkey

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,290
across their infrastructure which causes

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,049
chaos turns things on and off reroutes

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:46,059
things and the idea is that that's how

00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:50,110
they test the resiliency in their in

00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:53,169
their systems it's you know it's ballsy

00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,809
to tell you the truth but they also have

00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:59,950
incredible uptime and run an incredible

00:20:55,809 --> 00:21:02,830
scale so this one not five era I think

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,470
shakes out like this when we talk about

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,790
public cloud now I think you're talking

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,890
about three companies I think you're

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:12,250
talking about Amazon Google and

00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:14,380
Microsoft and the reason I say that is

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,410
because I think they have the massive

00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,570
scale the elasticity the footprint that

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:22,799
makes them truly cloudy they are a

00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:25,330
public utility just like electricity and

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:31,299
there they have this global footprint

00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:32,910
they are extremely extremely fast at the

00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:36,580
way they bring products the market it's

00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:39,760
it's amazing and that's where they're

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,950
strong stability security and privacy

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,630
and actually I would say in the last

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,120
couple I've given this talk through last

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,710
year I would say stability is less and

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,200
less of a concern but you know you used

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,970
to get like the head of the IT news

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,880
an Amazon had an outage would be like

00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,710
Amazon outage and ec2 east blah blah

00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,390
blah blah you don't see that like you

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:03,760
once did security is a perceived problem

00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,040
with public cloud I think it's more of

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,650
the fact that there's a big attack face

00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,140
there and that lack of control and lack

00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,400
of process around security I think the

00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,620
tools are getting better and better

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,210
there and the third one is privacy and

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,880
if you live in the United States and you

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,740
put your data on a network privacy

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,040
should be probably concerned for all of

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,230
us then then we have what i call the

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,500
managed cloud and these are people like

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:32,050
verizon terremark BTW CenturyLink people

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,880
that have clouds but they also earn

00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,020
their pipes I think that's really

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,430
important that the net neutrality

00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,440
legislation that has gone to Congress

00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:44,470
numerous times they were last year is

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,820
important because at some point where

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,580
you're paying for a different class of

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,320
service it's going to affect the way

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,480
your cloud works the thing about a

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,810
managed cloud is you can also buy the

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,140
pipes to your cloud so that gives you an

00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:03,010
advantage if that's if that's a

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:06,040
consideration for you you also exceed

00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:09,240
different security and SLA so you've got

00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:14,380
people like verizon and BTW and

00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:17,830
centurylink also give you different s

00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:20,680
la's than then amazon usually a higher

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:23,980
level or a finer grain so i think that's

00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,570
that's a differentiating factor then

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,970
there's this third class which I call

00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:34,510
the SP cloud so I call this er um these

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:36,100
s PSI clouds so they have system systems

00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,950
they sell they have system integrators

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,200
that help implement the cloud they

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:44,290
customize these clouds to meet your

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,570
specific needs so I look them that look

00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:49,750
at them as having a lot of the benefits

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:52,210
of a private cloud but with the added

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,400
benefit of their expertise and in the

00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,720
case of HP you can also get the hardware

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,240
you can get the networking you get to

00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,720
storage you can get you know yada yada

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,090
and software in IBM

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,919
same kind of thing so there's three

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:08,780
classifications or the one that five

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:12,470
cloud here's the other thing that

00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:15,460
happened and probably the catalyst for

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:19,190
taking us to cloud to dot 0 is

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,710
containers so I didn't say docker but

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,630
it's docker and it's rocket which is

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:29,270
from core LS you guys how many people

00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:31,700
here know core OS look at cool so the

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,159
thing that's interesting is in the early

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,650
days we abstracted the operating system

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,049
the hardware through virtualization so

00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:42,740
you had VMware you had then you know

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:44,390
later on you had kbm now we're going up

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,020
the stack in the user space and we're

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:51,409
abstracting the application layer in a

00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:55,220
largely using docker and this isn't a

00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:57,530
new concept they've had abstractions for

00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:01,549
at this layer and sun solaris for a long

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:05,030
time company called giant uses the

00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:07,760
luminous colonel they use containers and

00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,440
actually from a pure technology

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,860
implementation standpoint they're pretty

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:17,120
impressive but they're not as popular

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,980
and sometimes the you know it's the VHS

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,220
versus the Betamax argument sometimes

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,630
the most popular trumps the best

00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:28,840
technology and i'm not saying that's the

00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:30,799
case here but popularity helps it's also

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,440
proven that this kind of infrastructure

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,870
works by people like google so the other

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,740
day and Brandon Phillips gave the

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:42,880
keynote and he talked about giphy it's

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,590
basically Google infrastructure MV

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:50,120
Google runs everything on containers and

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:53,240
their Borg is is containers run by a you

00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,940
know to Bernie DS but highly specialized

00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,159
for Google but it gives you units of

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,520
resource isolation it gives you

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,650
portability and it gives you Molly

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,159
tenancy without heavyweight vm so you

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,840
don't have to emulate as much so you

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,460
have a lighter footprint and it should

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:15,530
be

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:17,930
scale better on your hardware everybody

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,670
going doctor doctor doctor containers

00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:22,100
containers containers and it really is

00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:25,070
the flux capacitor it makes it makes

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:30,470
time it makes cloud computing possible

00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:32,060
for cloud 20 and docker is is really

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,290
interesting company and everybody wants

00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,480
to work with them and they're adding

00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:37,880
some interesting things like Providence

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,400
they tell you where your your container

00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,470
ran in the past and where to give you

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,320
sort of an audit trail sort of speaking

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,860
to that security issue they give you

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,720
version control and allow you to have

00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:54,860
your own repos with docker that's sort

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:58,250
of their business model so interesting

00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:01,400
stuff it's it's enabling cloud to do

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:04,490
which I'm get to so at the end of this

00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,170
whole like era that we're in now and

00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,230
it's beginning the cloud to do I think

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:14,270
there's some interesting things going on

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:17,510
we have virtualization from kvm Zen and

00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:19,780
now containers virtualizing the

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:23,600
operating system of the app and hardware

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:27,380
we have distributed storage I could go

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:32,930
really deep into storage but anybody

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:35,030
here SEF user gluster user interested

00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:38,060
opens interesting open source

00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:42,980
distributed storage anybody here

00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:44,990
OpenStack users so staff file system

00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,990
with OpenStack storage seems to be a

00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:50,120
pretty popular combination I believe

00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,990
there's a big building across the street

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:56,090
that's invested heavily and doing that

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,910
then we have networking early on here we

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:01,640
talked about open daylight I think that

00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:04,100
having storage compute and networking

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,440
virtualization is the key for us to get

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:12,530
to cloud dot 0 to 0 got it in spades for

00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,750
compute and storage open daylight and

00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,700
some other initiatives are are starting

00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,280
to make it a reality because what you

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,680
want to be able to do is program your

00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,730
workload to spin up on the cloud of your

00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,730
choice

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,470
move from say one zone to another well

00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:29,600
when you move the zones you want to be

00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,309
able to tell not just the storage and

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,830
the compute to handle that so that the

00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:36,500
storage is distributed and your compute

00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:38,929
your vm might migrate sort of your live

00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:42,080
migration kind of thing or probably more

00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:43,820
likely start and stop or replicate into

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,770
another data center and then you got to

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,330
tie your networks together and the

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:50,059
network's seem to be physically bound

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,770
until this Sdn thing comes along and

00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:56,210
start to be able to dynamically do

00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:59,540
networking anybody here use for you

00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:02,270
doctor users you guys use weave for

00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:04,880
container networking allow you to do

00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:07,040
overlay not working for four containers

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,620
that's some of these projects are

00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,240
probably going to be I don't feel like

00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,280
this battle has been won or that's

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,160
shaken out like the other ones but it's

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,510
really important and the final thing is

00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,110
I think it's going to run more and more

00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:23,120
on open hardware so open compute is a is

00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,910
an open hardware spec it's been

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,370
pioneered by Google and Facebook and

00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:30,980
eBay and I forget all the other people

00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:33,290
but the idea is that rather than have a

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,600
proprietary hardware spec to run all

00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:38,450
this your pizza boxes that you're

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,720
racking are some kind of open standard

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:45,110
and you can open compute box that you

00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,690
get from HP would be theoretically or

00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,460
let's say vendor a and vendor be would

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,710
be identical and they could be built to

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,900
these specs and you can negotiate with

00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:56,210
them and in the end of the day somebody

00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,010
in Taiwan will probably be making them

00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:01,460
for pennies on the dollar compared to

00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:04,850
Dell and HP and selling them on amazon

00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,710
and ebay but not only is they've been

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:09,530
computed about their server hardware but

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,120
there's also open networking initiatives

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,220
and some of the networking that Facebook

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,210
has pioneered there have been open

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,210
sourcing slowly

00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:24,679
so where we're going is cloud 20 and

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:28,579
that's where awesome happens before I go

00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,320
too far into just cloud technology I get

00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:32,719
every talk I give I say this and I'll

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,179
never stop saying this but the thing is

00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:38,359
really interesting about the technology

00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:40,369
and open source is and I'm saying this

00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:42,379
is someone whose company sells four

00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:45,440
billion dollars worth of proprietary

00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:48,739
stuff a year is that open source isn't

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,009
Azir Oh some game that everybody

00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:56,739
collaborating on things like you know

00:30:52,009 --> 00:31:00,579
dr. runtimes and kvm virtualization and

00:30:56,739 --> 00:31:03,109
distributed storage and open daylight is

00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:05,719
interesting because at the end of the

00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:07,729
day there's certain things in our

00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:10,339
software that adds very little different

00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:13,940
shading value the Linux kernel is a good

00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:17,179
example if everybody if red hat and susa

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,979
and canonical all had to develop linux

00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:22,009
kernel's they couldn't spend their time

00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:24,789
doing cool stuff like management

00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:28,159
interfaces and things that add value and

00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:30,799
packet packaging the binaries and making

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,709
sure that they're tested they've

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:37,219
commoditised one layer and worked on

00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:39,289
innovating up the sack this is a quote

00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:43,070
from Allison Randall who I really like

00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:45,259
and had a great great quote about the

00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,690
fact that that we're not competing

00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:49,579
solely for limited resources but we're

00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:55,209
creating new opportunities for other

00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:58,489
people so cloud to do what we do is we

00:31:55,209 --> 00:32:00,109
develop what doesn't exist so my

00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:03,109
favorite thing and I don't think it's

00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:05,299
it's happens as much as it used to is

00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:08,269
people would say this is a really cool

00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:12,799
proprietary product let's open a create

00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:15,289
an open source version and I think there

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,940
are a lot of those things now and so

00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:19,159
what we're working on is doing cool

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,909
stuff that doesn't exist in proprietary

00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:25,370
of space a good example would be Q

00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:27,960
Bernie DS and docker

00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:29,400
we leverage the growing base of

00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,920
high-quality software we're leveraging

00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,920
Linux we're leveraging virtualization

00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:38,640
and then we commoditize stuff that

00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:41,700
doesn't the non differentiating tech so

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,860
people like the cloud foundry initiative

00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,710
they're creating an industry-wide paths

00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,630
that everybody can use and then

00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,150
companies are going to sell stuff on top

00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:55,380
of that I think Hadoop is another really

00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:58,170
good example so there's one massively

00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,020
lay leader in MapReduce space and it's

00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:03,540
Hadoop and people are offering ways to

00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:07,080
interact with that whether it's pivotal

00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:09,390
in their SQL stuff or data mining or

00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,310
storage or whatever it is they're

00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:13,230
they're not they're commoditizing the

00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:17,190
stuff that standard and then adding

00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:20,610
value of the stack the other thing about

00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:22,650
cloud to do remember i had my silos so

00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:25,200
we had public cloud we have private

00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,750
cloud now i think what we're doing is

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,720
we're competitive heisting things so you

00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:33,440
have distributed storage and maybe

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:38,700
you're that storage is being served from

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:41,550
an openstack cloud run by HP and you may

00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,920
have a monitoring service running from

00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:46,800
page or deity and you may have an app

00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,350
that you're running that does postal

00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,260
lookups from another vendor and you have

00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:54,480
all these these different components to

00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,010
deliver a product and they're know some

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,300
of that stuff may run in your own data

00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,990
center you may have credit-card

00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,450
adjudication that runs through some

00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,200
banking system all these things are

00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:08,490
components that you're putting together

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:11,310
to create a create a product or a

00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:16,740
service I hate to use the word service

00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:20,760
but it is software as a service so this

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:23,490
component is a shin is interesting that

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,700
that's the way they that they describe

00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:29,790
Sola back in 1995 that's the way we

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:32,000
describe microservices in 2015 20 years

00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,000
later

00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:39,379
so we have these design patterns where

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,409
we're using these services that do a

00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:44,480
single thing and the thing about the

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:46,369
micro services that I think is

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,320
interesting like is anybody here of

00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:53,419
deploying a mic receiving my crew

00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,760
service and every other prep Pratt I

00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:58,070
don't think there's a great like widely

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,200
I had a good example in the way over

00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:02,900
here and I'm getting old and forgetful

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,700
so I forget what it was but basically if

00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,869
the idea is it does one thing it does it

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:10,400
well the other thing is Netflix does

00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:12,200
that in the way they their

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,720
infrastructure runs they create micro

00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,690
services and the way they create them is

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:22,670
let's say we have my croissant it looks

00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:25,390
up all the movies with meg Ryan and all

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:29,240
of a sudden they said well microservice

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:32,180
20 is going to look up all the movies

00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:35,090
with meg ryan and tom hanks so they

00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:37,070
still let microservice one run but they

00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:39,530
run microservice to and to the point

00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:42,109
where it's deprecated so they may have

00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:44,900
this this revision of their micro

00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:47,720
services running until it's you know meg

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,210
Ryan tom hanks and john candy and they

00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,550
whatever whatever those micro services

00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:54,970
are they're all running consistently so

00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:58,580
people who are consuming those services

00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:00,950
may want to go to 20 but if it doesn't

00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:05,390
work they can back out and go to one dot

00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:07,430
oh so it's a very dynamic and flexible

00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,890
way to deploy things so that you have

00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:12,980
the option to try the latest and

00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:15,920
greatest but you know in the old days if

00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:18,680
I had a customer state facing service ID

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,109
and this was not very DevOps II we plan

00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,250
it for months then we have a maintenance

00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:27,980
window at 1212 a.m. sunday morning like

00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,420
I do not miss those days of sitting

00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,250
there and wondering what we're going to

00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,810
break and then sweating it out till

00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,670
Monday morning when all the users come

00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:37,099
back on and then you get all these calls

00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,930
and people are just pissed off at you I

00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:42,380
used to run tech support for a large

00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:44,210
company it happened quite a bit now they

00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,020
can run the micro service they run their

00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,840
tests again it

00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:50,990
against it and if it fails they can go

00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:53,630
back to microservice to data 30 doesn't

00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:55,700
work get a 20 cetera that's sort of the

00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:58,220
way they work at some point maybe

00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,840
microservice 10 is no longer being hit

00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,460
then you can retire it that you can let

00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,840
it run forever if you want to because it

00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,840
doesn't consume a ton of resources

00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:12,500
problem with that is we have a law a

00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:14,560
service proliferation and this is a an

00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,090
article from the new stack Alex Williams

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,860
interviewed Mitchell Hashimoto who I

00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:21,790
obviously have a geek crush on and was

00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:25,250
talking about Hoshi clerk tools said

00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:29,750
2015 is the year we start to see a

00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:31,730
proliferation of these services and not

00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,660
just managing them but the security

00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,940
around me I call this the zombie problem

00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,290
anybody watch The Walking Dead

00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:42,980
somebody's getting chased by the zombie

00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:44,000
they run into the house the best you

00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,200
know you know they're going to die when

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,330
they run in the house with a lot of

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,740
windows run in the house they bar the

00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,540
door and then the zombies come in the

00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:54,830
windows that's what happens when you

00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:58,430
have all these microservices so here's

00:37:54,830 --> 00:38:00,790
how it shakes out then in my opinion and

00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:05,000
I have an opinion I may not be right but

00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:10,280
I think I am public cloud we have these

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,620
three there amazon google microsoft they

00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:16,730
are the utility computing they are you

00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:21,110
know pervasive huge footprints massive

00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:23,390
scale competitive prices level not a lot

00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,190
of differentiation in the long term like

00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,290
right now I would say Google and Amazon

00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:30,620
are pretty similar with the exception of

00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:32,930
amazon has a ton more micro services

00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:37,520
like fob watch and the tools and things

00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:39,440
like that you got google too who's just

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,900
sort of the sleeping giant or just

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,730
slowly doing their thing and probably

00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:46,100
will wall up everybody in the long term

00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:48,920
and then they got microsoft who I think

00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,740
cloud is very interesting because they

00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,780
are very well positioned to help take

00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:56,750
windows based applications to the cloud

00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,400
right now I think my croissant and

00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,510
Google

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,710
very much the linux unix based

00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:05,800
applications get a cloud really easily

00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:08,170
but windows distributed apps there's not

00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,570
that abundance of tools like there are

00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:14,650
in the open source tied Microsoft's

00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:18,190
changing that very quickly then you got

00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,960
private cloud here's the thing private

00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,870
cloud now I would call the minimum

00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,030
viable cloud you want to emulate amazon

00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:28,290
to the point that you need to emulate

00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:31,900
amazon you don't want to add all these

00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:34,210
mathas you know tools and micro services

00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,920
and all the things that amazon has what

00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,930
you want to do is create what you need

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,450
to have in your data center and then

00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:46,210
consume public cloud services if

00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:49,090
appropriate and meld them together then

00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:53,470
we have what I call public cloud plus so

00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:57,700
you've got hosters like Verizon like HP

00:39:53,470 --> 00:40:00,190
like IBM and Salesforce and Salesforce

00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,110
is a really good example of this is you

00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:05,050
know Salesforce pot this company called

00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:07,510
Heroku back in the day her who was it

00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:10,600
was the pass I mean it was it was really

00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:12,190
good and the wet Amazon did was we're

00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,110
going to do this platform as a service

00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,300
that people can build applications at

00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:20,680
level leverage Salesforce and they did

00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:23,740
that very very well and so that that's a

00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:27,970
specific use case HP will probably

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:30,340
create a public cloud with services that

00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:34,540
are very attractive to their user base

00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,940
maybe it does things like take advantage

00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:40,180
of their mercurial testing tool or

00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:43,000
mercury tools or development tools or

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:46,750
things like that verizon will create

00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,500
clouds probably where where network

00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:52,390
integrity is very very important and IBM

00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,520
will probably come up with something i

00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:57,610
can't even

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,800
so here's where it shakes out I think

00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:02,980
what we have is we used to call this

00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,320
hybrid cloud and put everything in silos

00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,390
now I just say there's one cloud and

00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,610
it's fabric is made up of different

00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:12,100
cloud services in your data center in

00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,980
the public cloud and they're woven

00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:20,200
together and I think this abundance of

00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:23,520
tools this increased reliability of

00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:26,380
public clouds I think an increased

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:30,820
probably four years ago I was a cloud

00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:32,980
connect and and when bald was one of the

00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,780
cloud VCS was doing the panel and

00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,610
they're like what's the number one thing

00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:42,060
that was inhibiting cloud production

00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:46,270
cloud you stand and we unanimously

00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:48,700
decided that it was knowledge people

00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:50,500
just didn't know how to interact with

00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,140
clouds they didn't understand that all

00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,850
these things were API driven now I think

00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,010
there's a lot more cloud knowledge than

00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,660
there were four years ago and there's a

00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,070
lot more people with cloud experience

00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,830
because they played around with Amazon

00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:06,730
or Google or they've downloaded open

00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:10,060
stack or CloudStack or maybe smarter

00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:12,040
less and played around with it and done

00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:16,119
projects etc and now I think people are

00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:18,940
moving faster so that was my pitch I'm

00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:21,280
sorry I went through things pretty fast

00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,830
skipped over a lot of stuff the slides

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,369
are on SlideShare put that URL up

00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:28,869
earlier if you just search for my

00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:31,780
presentation title it'll come up and

00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:34,570
Google I guarantee it there's also a

00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,670
deck for open daylight there and there's

00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:40,510
some other decks when cloud computing

00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:43,090
open source with I try and put a lot of

00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:44,800
links in my presentations because in 40

00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:46,840
minutes I can't do justice to all the

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,170
things we just copied but hopefully it's

00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:52,510
a good pointer and you can find stuff in

00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:55,150
the forums and open source projects out

00:42:52,510 --> 00:43:01,410
there support clouds so that's all I had

00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:01,410
is a I can answer question or two sure

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:15,460
yep well because it's past so so I mean

00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:18,219
do you put softlayer like what do you

00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:22,410
pick do you pick ice blue mix or

00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:22,410
softlayer I put softlayer in earlier

00:43:24,299 --> 00:43:32,079
yeah I mean they're both cloud services

00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:34,509
so yet that lack of space that's the

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,039
only reason or you know whatever comes

00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:39,309
up first in the Google search for IBM

00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:41,349
cloud but I think IBM is a really good

00:43:39,309 --> 00:43:44,099
player in the cloud space they're soft

00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:47,259
layers was a really good acquisition

00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:51,630
which runs Apache CloudStack by the way

00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:51,630
not OpenStack yes

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,870
yeah they make something called cloud if

00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:04,630
I and I think it's used it some

00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:12,430
significant scale there are European I

00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:15,430
think I believe its platform as a

00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:21,460
service I think ebay's is it for four at

00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:24,520
some scale third yeah now because klouda

00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,290
file run on top of I know clarify fairly

00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,390
well because they they ran on top of

00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:34,990
CloudStack and I believe they ran on top

00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:37,060
of it but stack yeah yeah but really

00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:39,670
more of the applications running on

00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:45,370
there and that not all the scheduling

00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:48,420
like okay anything else okay thanks a

00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,420
