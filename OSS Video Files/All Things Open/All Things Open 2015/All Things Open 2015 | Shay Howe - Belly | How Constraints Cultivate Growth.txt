can everyone see okay like it you guys

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,500
on that side can you see this all right

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:16,500
good enough okay cool so my name is Shay

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,480
I'm a designer front-end developer I'm

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,820
from Chicago where I work at a startup

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,449
called belly I wanted to ask how many

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,000
people consider themselves designers

00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:28,859
okay awesome what about engineers for

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,309
developers okay so about half a hat

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,170
that's pretty cool so today specifically

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,149
I'm going to talk a bit a bit excuse me

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,059
a bit about the benefit of constraints

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,219
how constraints have helped me but also

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,230
how they can help you and we'll talk a

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,969
little bit about problem solving and in

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,010
general just becoming better designers

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,219
developers and better teammates all

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,750
around and I want to start here if you

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,140
will take pic a little journey with me

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,640
go back to your childhood playground

00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,620
okay maybe close your eyes just think

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,660
about what that looks like and then

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,010
strip all the rules out of that

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,350
playground what happens for me like

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,450
dodgeball just takes over the blacktop

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,409
right people are jumping ropes and

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,299
playing Red Rover and they're just

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,850
getting pelleted with balls leping right

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,070
I would personally cheat it freeze tag

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,689
you would tag me I would continue to run

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,900
away and laugh at you the entire time

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,820
and despite like anything we ever tried

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,710
to do in that playground would never

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,229
actually be our turn to go on the swings

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,450
just simply wouldn't happen and without

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,640
rules there's no telling to what type of

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,400
chaos is going to break out on that

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,890
playground I don't think our industry is

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,560
that much different design development

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,270
it's not all that different we can

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,610
design we can build we can engineer

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,310
anything we want we often do it's kind

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,020
of the most beautiful part of our craft

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,450
rise that we can go out and solve these

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,130
really ambitious problems and our

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,979
possibilities are endless and the

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,630
constraints there are near invisible but

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,750
I'm not totally convinced that's a good

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,840
idea I'm not totally convinced that this

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,920
free range will make our lives easier

00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,020
proved to be more successful for

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,479
ourselves I'm not totally convinced I'm

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,849
just not sure and I like to think that

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,750
like a playground without rules we often

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,310
have trouble without these constraints

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,860
this is what I want to spend some time

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,100
today actually diving into and taking a

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,130
closer look at now I grew up in Ohio is

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,040
anyone from Ohio yeah all right what

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:31,480
part all right you're better than I am I

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,340
grew up in like a cornfield so in Ohio I

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,950
think it's for all of ohio if you're in

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,660
first grade they give you a walnut tree

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,980
and at the time when I was in first

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,740
grade and I really understood why they

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,000
gave me a walnut tree what I did know

00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,550
those I wanted to have the biggest

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,620
baddest walnut tree anyone had ever seen

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,480
and I was wrote in the hallways at

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,739
school yelling at my friends that my

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,239
true is going to be bigger than theirs

00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,530
and that we'd be climbing on my tree

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,190
before their tree was even out of the

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,380
ground I was pretty ambitious and I knew

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,470
the basics of a tree right the basics

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:05,050
being water and Sun right tree will grow

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,430
tall and strong but I knew I had to like

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,620
live up to the expectations I was

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,650
setting with my friends so I sought out

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,310
a park ranger for advice and I went up

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:17,440
to him I said excuse me mr. tree cop

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,989
first mistake all right Park Rangers

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,060
does not like to be called a tree cop we

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,340
got over that I basically asked him I

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,570
said hey I have this walnut tree I love

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,330
it to look like some of your walnut

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,950
trees how do I make that happen he

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,209
started to walk me through how to take

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,610
care of a train he said basically what

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,350
you have to do is prune that tree early

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,720
and often he's like removed those low

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,730
hanging branches all the dead leaves and

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,260
let the water nutrients that go into the

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,140
tree actually go to the top of it and

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,579
support its growth they're out and he

00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,000
told me something I've never forgotten

00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:51,459
to this day he said Shay don't waste

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,040
resources on growth that doesn't serve a

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:57,430
purpose and it's always stuck with me

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,470
right he's talking about a tree and it's

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,290
set with me this entire time and he was

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,690
right I followed his advice my tree did

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,670
grow taller stronger and faster and that

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:10,540
idea that constrain a fewer resources

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,040
for my tree actually made it better now

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,720
Microsoft have the same constraint

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,049
approach back in the 90s this is that

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,019
window air think of Windows three NT 95

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,760
98 say what you will this is also the

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,229
error of internet explorer and at the

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,620
time or the world's most powerful

00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,970
browsers to ever be seen

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,160
and Microsoft would do something pretty

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,050
interesting they would go out and hire

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,210
three people for a project that they

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,440
knew required five and they didn't do

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,090
this because they couldn't afford to

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,710
hire those people or that they didn't

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,440
have the actual office space to host

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,540
them they did very instinctively they

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,970
wanted to create an environment that

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,350
self motivated people were loved they

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,970
were looking for the type of people who

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,190
are willing to trade that extra work for

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,949
autonomy and ownership around what they

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,350
were building these people knew it was

00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,720
their jobs open Microsoft and grow the

00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,010
business not run it right then we're

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,510
going to sit at their desk and punch

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,330
keys they were going to try and push

00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,370
Microsoft beyond its balance right and

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,260
with constraints they force those people

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,400
to meet a subie to be more creative and

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,370
more productive around what they were

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,070
doing now for me this is my worst

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,410
nightmare this is that blank canvas that

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,350
MP codebase if you will right starting

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,410
from scratch scares me to death right

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,570
and there are are no rules here right

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,789
there are no guidance or bounds or

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,800
anything so the first thing I do is I

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,479
have to layer on constraints to help me

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,919
decide how to get started and to

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,070
determine where I'm going to go once i

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,539
actually get moving now belly one of the

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,240
very first products I worked on was our

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,729
tech block and again totally blue sky I

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,139
go for it do what you want Shay so the

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:44,370
very first thing i did was i layered out

00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,650
a grid and i was like i'm gonna use a

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,360
vertical at baseline grid just giving

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,310
myself some sort of constraints here i

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,810
started to think about what colors do we

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,240
have we have a primary and secondary

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,430
color we use a wire blue every now and

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,570
then we have a green as an accent start

00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,880
to think about the actual information

00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,169
architecture of the site what pages were

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,180
we going to have how are they going to

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,039
link together right what was the scale

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,110
of this and then I started to blow down

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,199
what was our typography what typefaces

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,880
do we use at what weights and sizes

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,260
generally speaking we used open sans we

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,150
followed the bringhurst typographic

00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,740
scale so it's giving myself some rules

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,960
to actually get started and moved here

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,160
and once I had a lot of this done that I

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,510
could start to embellish the rest of the

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,030
site with some of the more clever

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,789
details and it's a pretty clean design

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,410
with a very limited set of resources

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:30,240
right I didn't waste time on frivolous

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,800
decisions that didn't actually all that

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,930
much matter and the grand scheme of

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,520
things I gave myself some constraints

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,370
and let a lot of those decisions expose

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,310
the answers to myself now Marissa Mayer

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,410
said it really well

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,540
she said constraints shape and focus

00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,360
problems and provide clear challenges to

00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:48,640
overcome adding constraints neared my

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,080
options all the while also opening my

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,090
eye to any of the given possibilities

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,350
within them I can examine what I was

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,300
doing more precisely and a lot more

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,820
closely right I can make decisions

00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,470
quicker and easier and I get focused on

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,660
the important aspects of the solution I

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:05,200
was trying to get to I let constraints

00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,850
lead me to that solution given fewer

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,730
resources we have to make better

00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,960
decisions right excess resources add to

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,120
the cost of the completing a task

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,310
they're not all that beneficial to the

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,990
actual results I think like notorious

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,740
b.i.g was onto something Ryan he's like

00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,990
Mo Money mo problems tend to agree right

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,180
but more people potentially we have more

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,860
problems right with more options we

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,720
certainly have more decisions to think

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,250
about what if more resources there's a

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,200
lot more stuff we have to sift through

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,670
to figure out what we're going to have

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,560
that's going to make the largest impact

00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,390
and that's kind of the job at the end of

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,860
the day right is to focus on what will

00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,510
have the largest impact at the least

00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,970
amount of effort right how do we get

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:46,360
from A to B we have to use fewer

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,070
resources and constraints to do that now

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,720
basketball started as an indoor winter

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,490
sport the sport in which they would take

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,800
these peach baskets and drill them on

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,180
either end of a wall and over time those

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,220
peach baskets would get brittle and

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,870
eventually fall apart and someone came

00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,600
up with the idea to say hey let's get a

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,700
metal hoop but they closed rope net now

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,020
this improved the baskets from falling

00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,730
apart but the ball still had to be

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,870
physically removed from the net so

00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,700
somewhat have to take a broomstick and

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,110
pop it out or a ladder what would have

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,110
you to actually physically retrieve the

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:17,020
ball and it took a decade I kid you not

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,580
a decade for someone to say hey just cut

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,700
a hole in the net right let the ball

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,650
fall through now that actually improve

00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,000
the actual experience of the game but

00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,180
players still moved up and down the

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,790
court fairly slow so slow in fact that

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,680
November of 1950 the Fort Wayne Pistons

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:36,000
played the Minneapolis Lakers and the

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:39,160
score of a 48-minute game was 19 to 18th

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,350
that's not good right that is incredibly

00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,080
boring and the sport was losing traction

00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:47,380
and slowly slowly starting to died in

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,240
1953 NBC was like mm we're not going to

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,230
actually air the NBA championship we

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,879
don't think anyone's actually going to

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,220
tune in to watch this

00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:56,869
then enter Danny buys them Danny was the

00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,239
owner of the Syracuse Nationals at the

00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:01,429
time it's got a lot of time and energy

00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:04,399
and money wrapped up into this team and

00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:07,040
the sport MBA and Danny's like this

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,389
cannot fail so Danny started to do some

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,089
thinking of how he could actually

00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:13,399
improve the sport of basketball and he

00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:15,199
knew everyone enjoyed it when teams

00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,869
would score everyone liked the idea of

00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:19,670
offense and Danny thought made it'd be

00:09:17,869 --> 00:09:21,709
really cool if every team could score

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,649
roughly 80 points per game and he

00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:26,119
started to do some math he said ok the

00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,279
team needs a score 80 points per game

00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:30,350
that means based off the average field

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:33,559
goal percentage each team needs to take

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,290
roughly 60 shots a game now there are

00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,029
two teams need to each take 60 shots so

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,610
that means there needs to be 120 shots

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:42,980
taken in a game of basketball now game

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,299
is 48 minutes long that breaks down into

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,059
two thousand eight hundred eighty

00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:52,220
seconds Danny continue to do the math he

00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:53,720
said ok 2880 seconds / 120 shots means

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,329
that there needs to be a shot taken

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,119
every 24 seconds in a game to actually

00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:01,339
hit that average so Danny put these

00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:03,529
clocks on the either end of his court

00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:05,569
and he had his team scrimmage one

00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:08,089
another and instantly the game moved

00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:09,619
faster right he thought he was on to

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:11,119
something so he invited league officials

00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:13,279
in to watch his team scrimmage one

00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:17,540
another they all fell in love with the

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,670
way the game actually moved now the year

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,769
after NBC decided not to air the NBA

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,160
championship the shot clock went into

00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:27,829
official rule in 1954 that year alone

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,399
team scored 30-plus more points per game

00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:32,749
an attendance grew by over forty percent

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,850
Danny found himself in the basketball

00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:36,649
hall of fame by creating regulation and

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,600
constraints for the game of basketball I

00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:41,259
think we can learn a lot from the way

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,699
Danny approach this I have an example I

00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:46,009
was on all state's website the other day

00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:47,419
renewing my car insurance and I had

00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:49,399
recently moved sounds like I should

00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:51,049
check actually what like my quote is and

00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,089
that my premium fits what I'm actually

00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:54,499
getting my coverage for and I came

00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,799
across this form it's a pretty standard

00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:58,970
forms got a decent tooltip looks nice

00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,709
but as i was browsing the web site it

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,779
came across this form and I'm

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,669
predominantly a designer by trade and

00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,100
this just didn't sit quite well with me

00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,870
and I

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,210
took a hard look at it and I was like

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,610
well though the font size is different

00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,860
the colors the border things are a

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:17,010
little slightly off and then I noticed

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:20,910
it was like oh they inverse the gravy on

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:23,520
the button that's weird I was like hey I

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,490
don't know I've done worse that's not

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,470
well perhaps that tool tip is the same

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:31,560
it wasn't I couldn't quite figure out

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,140
what that was about I said that's fine

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,570
Soviet as I continue to browse the

00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,460
website it came across this form I was

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,640
like all right now this is that same

00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,290
form this is the start a quote now form

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,390
yet it looks completely different once

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,360
again right the border is the label

00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,620
placement the font size the button

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,600
everything's kind of like off the rocker

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,570
except for one thing that one thing

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,130
being that ? for the tooltip that's like

00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,420
all right it's got to be the same

00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,860
library right maybe positions kind of

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,360
random the size is a little bit off

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,850
wasn't quite sure what was happening

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,140
here so I decided to buy a new car

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:12,000
instead not the best logic some days I

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,290
had it over to auto trader and

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,850
immediately was kind of look at this was

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:18,180
like this just doesn't feel quite right

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:20,310
either and specifically the idea of all

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,050
the buttons on the page I was like

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,360
summer green summer white some are blue

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:26,880
summer read half of those have arrows

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,060
some don't some of the arrows in circles

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,160
some aren't couldn't quite figured out

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,540
what it felt like though was that auto

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,250
trader had different teams working on

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,470
this website and they were all iterating

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,260
in slightly different directions right

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,520
and gently they're starting to slide off

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,680
track and things were getting a little

00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,200
dispersed from one another I was like

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,350
well eventually that turns into this all

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,760
right and this isn't good either all

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,190
right this is like that point of no

00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,360
return and I don't think you can like

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,680
wholeheartedly look at this and like

00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,360
we're going to iterate our way out of

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,800
this one guys I don't think so no this

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,390
is satire this is obviously a little

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,660
over the top and it actually does its

00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:08,190
job fairly well but these problems right

00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,840
this happens with design it happens a

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,730
development or code bases and get

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,440
corrupt over time and the idea of

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,290
consistency and standards are a bit of a

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,790
problem and I'm not here to pick on all

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,840
state and autotrader and Ling's like

00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,940
these are problems

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,940
have day in and day out I can show you

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,050
my work some days it's pretty scary and

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,580
I venture to guess a lot of you guys

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,780
struggle with that as well we could use

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,940
a bit of help we can use some

00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,520
constraints we give you some regulation

00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,230
to help ourselves through this this is

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,060
often where I dropping the idea of a

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,530
style guide right it's that constraint

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,030
to provide a better user experience and

00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:41,490
a cleaner code base around what we're

00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,960
doing now if you're not familiar style

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,520
guides our document that outlined the

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,170
actual stop a website perhaps you've

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,300
heard of mentioned it's like a visual

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,970
library or pattern library very close in

00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,650
the same but it helps us improve our

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,820
consistency and maintainability around

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,560
what we're actually designing and

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,640
building and one of the most popular is

00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,500
and one of the first ones actually kind

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,300
of hit the scene was the gel the global

00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,330
experience language built by the BBC and

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,530
it sets constraints for any property or

00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,810
website that they're actually going to

00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,430
go out and build and it really dives in

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,440
either identifies all their different

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,600
visual abstractions design patterns

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,610
development restrictions you name it and

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,290
it lets them unify everything that

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,110
they're going to do on top of this

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,510
because they have this documented it

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,000
lets a cohesive more enjoyable design

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,010
and code base emerge out of it right and

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,780
it provides a better user experience for

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,240
their users as they browse all their

00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,830
different websites now style guides are

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,870
becoming quite popular to write they're

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:37,770
used by quite a few companies google has

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:39,900
one firefox starbucks salesforce yo we

00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:42,090
use one at belly right the idea of a

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,320
style guide is taking hold i venture to

00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,560
guess some of you actually use one

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,150
already now regulation improve that

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,160
experience in basketball right without

00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,140
it it's very unlikely the sport was

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,270
actually going to make it rules can

00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,310
improve our experiences online too they

00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,530
can help us simplify and help us create

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,840
some consistency I think the best

00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,610
designs is the best code bases come from

00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,190
very simple and organized strategies

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,920
right areas where we set and follow

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,530
rules and we do so consistently right

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,170
let's use a style guide or pattern

00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:15,300
library to help us do that right and use

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:18,330
that stuff to help improve our actual

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,770
user experiences does anyone know who

00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:24,180
this man is by chance who's got it

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:26,310
macgyver yeah this is the king of

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,860
constraints right here MacGyver's like

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,400
oh snap that's a bomb I have a paper

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:34,000
clip and we'll fix it

00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,880
this guy takes a stethoscope a bread

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,090
blood pressure cuff and alarm clock and

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,490
makes a lie detector right I remember

00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:46,150
one episode he takes a coffin and turns

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,770
it into a jet ski I cannot figure out

00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,520
where the motor comes in in this

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:53,710
scenario but he figures it out now one

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,680
episode specifically MacGyver stuck in

00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:59,380
this enemy compound right and he needs

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,960
to escape but the catch is he has this

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,820
injured man an injured woman with him

00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,710
right and they are basically relying on

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,630
him to get them out of this enemy

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,790
compound now in a normal day that's

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,640
that's fine but this is MacGyver's world

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,380
so the road the only road to actually

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,050
get out of this enemy compound is

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,000
blocked off so MacGyver is stuck and he

00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,350
has to struggle to fill this out I'm

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,210
gonna play with cliff and hopefully I

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:27,190
can get this to work so the gauge of a

00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,710
train track in the United States matches

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:33,340
the wheelbase of my own Jeep give or

00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:35,740
take an inch this cheap looked the same

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:39,400
as mine and the tracks outside were a

00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,110
close match none of that mattered of

00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,530
course if I couldn't get the engine

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:47,550
running I want to take a second here so

00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:50,080
the roads blocked okay MacGyver's like

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:52,390
that's a jeep and that's a railroad

00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,190
track and using his logic he knows that

00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,830
the wheelbase of the Jeep matches that a

00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,810
railroad track I don't think I would

00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,310
have got there myself personally but

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,220
this is MacGyver we're talking about I'm

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:06,459
like all right you like you that's fair

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:08,080
but the Jeep doesn't actually run yet so

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:13,709
how does he figure this one out let's

00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:15,209
take a look well

00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:17,449
the engine going didn't seem to be a

00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,449
problem

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,650
but keeping it going just might be

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,840
radiators bone-dry my guess was a few

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,990
bullet holes had something to do with

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,990
that

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:55,640
what alright so you can Hotwire the Jeep

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,539
MacGyver not his first time doing that

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:02,390
but the radiator has bullet holes in it

00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:04,370
I don't even know where radiator at on a

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,260
car couldn't couldn't figure out now

00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,630
keep in mind like he has this injured

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,070
man and woman with him still and at this

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,419
point in the episode his enemies have

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,460
basically triangulated and they know

00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:15,020
pretty much where he's at right they're

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,059
closing in on him and time is actually

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,400
of the essence he has to get out of

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:22,750
there does anyone know if he pulls this

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,130
off has anyone seen this episode no one

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,690
all right can you guys hear this by the

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,400
way is it or it's working with that cool

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,970
let's see let's see if he can get out of

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,669
here there are times you can't do a job

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,340
all by yourself what I needed was a

00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:40,299
little help from the locals local

00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,299
chicken studies

00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,900
egg whites are good for a lot of things

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,230
lemon meringue pie angel food cake and

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,929
plugging up reindeers

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,610
the idea is the boiling water in the

00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:58,669
radiator will cook the eggs and they'll

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:02,140
temporarily plug the holes that is if

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:02,140
the holes part to be

00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:17,919
what is going on all right so despite so

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,499
many constraints MacGyver stays focused

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,620
though right he simply looks at one

00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:26,139
problem at a time and checks it off

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:29,379
roads blocked ok jeep railroad track

00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:31,899
think that will work no keys that's fine

00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:34,899
we can Hotwire the Jeep there are bullet

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:36,210
holes in the radiator all good they heat

00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:40,179
up some water and cook some egg whites

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:42,190
right I don't get it the man blocks out

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,529
what isn't immediately important to him

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,659
right there's an injured man there's the

00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:48,730
woman yes that is an issue but MacGyver

00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,559
knows he can't actually help them unless

00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,419
they get out of there then there are his

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,279
enemies closing on him that's an issue

00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:56,470
too but he can't do anything about that

00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,539
either he has to get out of there he

00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:01,749
simply stays focused right and gets down

00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:03,159
to work now Mythbusters tried this this

00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:05,499
is a side story we can talk about this

00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,669
later but this is possible actually to

00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:11,080
actually plug up bullet holes in her

00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:13,360
radiator Wow so my best tool to focus is

00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,580
it to do list I know it's a bit cliche

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,009
it's easy to say but I really do it

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,690
right I have to track what to do and

00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,369
when to do it and basically my thought

00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,559
is if I get all this written down on

00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:25,570
paper I can create this prioritize game

00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,789
plan around what I need to do and I can

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,679
take all that free mental energy that

00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,389
used to be occupied but all the task I

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,059
had to do and actually use that to

00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:35,710
accomplish what's on my list right and I

00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:36,909
could focus my attention on what I'm

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,379
getting done at any given point cause

00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:39,399
I'm not having to worry about what else

00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,259
is on the list because I know it's

00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:43,570
written down and then I build momentum

00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:45,730
around actually crossing these tasks off

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:48,009
and I get in the groove I start flowing

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,019
through it now i use the Pomodoro

00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:51,999
Technique to do this right this is a

00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:53,559
technique in which identify a task

00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:55,480
hopefully it's small enough that it can

00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,909
be accomplished in 25 minutes right and

00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,590
I work on that task for 25 minutes and I

00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:01,840
better have it done at the end and then

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:04,149
I take a five-minute break and I work in

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,220
these intervals in every four pomodori

00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:07,929
so to speak I take a longer break right

00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,669
perhaps I go get a cup of coffee I use a

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:11,679
bathroom I you at lunch right I'll go

00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,210
for a walk what have you and I work on

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,679
these intervals to create flow around

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,970
what I'm doing think of it as like

00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:17,500
circuit training in the gym or something

00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,430
like that but with your head in an

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,770
office but you're

00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,720
strained to completing a given task in a

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,340
given amount of time right and it really

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,010
helps you boost your focus in your

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,360
rhythm around what you're getting done

00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,790
we can improve our productivity by

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,370
removing these distractions right simply

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,410
enough just focusing we can't lose sight

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:38,330
of the purpose of the problem and who

00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,040
that problems being solved for right and

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,050
we can use these constraints to work

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,500
more effectively right by getting down

00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,540
and removing those distractions now

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,160
constraints also have this weird

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,380
unexpected perkin that they allow us to

00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,260
actually bond together now Canadian

00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,330
Geese migrate over 900 miles twice a

00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,130
year right up and down North America

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,250
there's a lot of constraints involved in

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,870
that forage Mayweather they have fatigue

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,910
there are hunters literally trying to

00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,830
shoot them out of the sky but these

00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,350
birds fly together in this V formation

00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,690
and as they do this the birds in the

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,310
back by slightly above the bird in front

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,620
of them there's a handful of reasons

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:17,630
first reason is it allows them to reduce

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,090
drag right so they can fly a bit further

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,740
but it also allows them to improve their

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,330
visibility they can keep track of one

00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,970
another and help each other out and

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:28,100
those birds in the back allows them to

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,810
hawk down to the birds in the front to

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,600
encourage them and keep them going and

00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:34,520
the birds rotate leaders alright so the

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,470
birds in the front as they get tired can

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,270
slide out and fall to the back right and

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,490
everyone takes their turn actually

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,500
leading a group and if a bird happens to

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,690
get injured two other birds will go down

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,610
and stay with it so that when that bird

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,560
is back to health they can fly back up

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,630
to the group again in that V formation

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,360
and scientists have done some pretty

00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,950
deep studies on the Canadian geese and

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,350
they've found out that these birds by

00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:00,440
flying of this V formation are able to

00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:02,480
fly over seventy percent further than

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,210
most other birds right these birds can

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,390
fly for 16 hours straight without having

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,710
to touch land now Fisher are kind of in

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,210
that same line right they swim in

00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,490
schools they believe in this idea of

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,890
safety of numbers for them it's easier

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,780
to swim right that draft actually allows

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,610
them to preserve their energy they also

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,410
appear larger to write to discourage

00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:24,170
predators from trying to attack them and

00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:26,000
with more eyes in the school it's easier

00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:29,350
for them to find food and actually take

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,850
down larger food items and fish use

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,250
shared leadership right they follow the

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,230
idea of consensus decision-making that

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,419
in which when a school of fish is

00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,370
swimming the most experienced fish is at

00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:40,900
the front kind of leading the way and if

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,270
it actually hits something that may be

00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,520
an obstacle or dangerous it just turns

00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,169
right and in the direction it turns the

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,970
most experienced fish on the other side

00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:50,679
in the side of that direction of turn

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,510
then takes ownership and starts a

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,669
leading right and if you've ever seen a

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,169
school fish swim it's kind of beautiful

00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:57,490
how they actually like flow through the

00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:59,559
water and jump around and share

00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:02,200
leadership right they're incredibly

00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:04,750
agile they're incredibly efficient now

00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,090
decent fish self select their leaders

00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,799
they have a common sense of direction

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,929
and community around what they're doing

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,090
I think we need the same thing in some

00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:15,220
of our teams now my friend Michael

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,340
Norton who also goes by doc introduced

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,510
me the idea of collaboration contracts

00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,309
collaboration contract is a constraint

00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:23,080
to get the right people on a team to

00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:24,659
help make a decision and I'll walk you

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,549
through a bit of what this looks like

00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,559
first and foremost you set the context

00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,970
of a decision that needs to be made you

00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:32,710
don't actually make the decision you

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,260
just set out the context of hey this is

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,090
what we need to decide then everyone the

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,830
team selects their desired role in

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,270
helping make that decision those desired

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,340
roles are preset and I'll walk you

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,919
through the five rolls here in a second

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,360
but everyone says this is what I want my

00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,010
roller my involvement in making the

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,679
decision to be and there may be

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:52,270
conflicts in those roles so those need

00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:53,799
to be resolved and then the team needs

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,860
to set out and actually make a committee

00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:58,840
and the decision so the walls you can

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,220
have and helping make a decision so

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,020
imagine we've set the context of a

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,309
decision that needs to be made then

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,140
every one of the team has to select one

00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:07,000
of these five roles so you can say hey I

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,470
want the explain role where I'm going to

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,200
make the decision and I will explain to

00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:14,080
the team why I made that decision or

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,090
I'll be a consult role and saying I'm

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,559
going to make the decision but I will

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,450
ask for your everyone's input or

00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,309
feedback before I do that now those

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,690
first two roles are sole decision makers

00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:24,850
right only one person is actually making

00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,440
that decision the third rule then is

00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,419
agree and that's essentially saying hey

00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,250
I don't have to make the citizen alone

00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:32,350
but I have to be an agreement with the

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:34,780
decision I'll work with whoever wants to

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,309
make this decision the fourth rolls

00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,630
advise and that's essentially saying hey

00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:39,040
I actually don't need to make the

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,200
decision but I have some feedback and

00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,309
input I loved

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,440
give to the team that's actually going

00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:45,450
to make the decision then the last role

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,440
is inquired essentially saying I don't

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,760
actually have much to add to this

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,049
conversation so go ahead and make the

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,179
decision without me but when you make it

00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:53,549
please let me know all right and

00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:54,960
conflicts can occur here right so

00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:56,490
someone may come in and say alright I'm

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,139
going to consult and center that I am

00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,460
going to make the decision but i'll ask

00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,260
you guys for feedback before i do that

00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,299
and someone else may be sitting there

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,580
saying i'm in an agree role that in

00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:07,559
which i have to agree with the decision

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,539
that needs to be made those two might

00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:12,029
not get along or understand that they

00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,980
need to set that context and this

00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:16,200
scenario we ask everyone to basically

00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,570
favor the lesser of the controlling

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,490
roles so then who was in consult would

00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,779
actually need to step down to agree and

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,429
who was an agree would actually need to

00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:25,860
step down to advise and those two people

00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:27,630
would have to work together now all too

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,580
often you see a lot of people bundle up

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,990
in the actual Greece side and you have

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,519
to ask those people to take a hard look

00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,649
at that and say hey is anyone actually

00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,809
willing to step down in to advise or

00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:38,370
into the actual enquire right is there

00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,899
someone else on the team that you trust

00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,970
to represent your views and help make

00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:43,470
that decision now once all those

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,360
conflicts are finished and ironed out

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,309
the established leaders and work towards

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,380
a given decision right and because the

00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:51,539
team did this themselves everyone has to

00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,429
honor those roles and abide by the given

00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:55,830
decision and the idea of collaboration

00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:57,299
contracts work really well right it

00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,010
provides a way for teams to self-select

00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:01,440
their own leaders much like those geese

00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,669
and fish right it also puts clarity

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,559
around all of our levels of engagement

00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:06,029
what we're doing and it puts the

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,549
responsibility of the decision-making

00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,649
process back into the team the team owns

00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:12,149
the decision management doesn't write

00:27:10,649 --> 00:27:14,190
the team had to make that decision and

00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:17,039
they can holistically self-organized as

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,750
they do that now some of the best

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,029
collaboration has been done within the

00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,399
idea of constraints Paul McCartney and

00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:25,500
John Lennon always collaborated within

00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:27,779
constraints all right McCartney was

00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,299
really good at melody Lennon was

00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:32,220
excellent at lyrics McCartney songs were

00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:34,260
generally uplifting Lennon's always had

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,120
an edge and they were always thought of

00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,429
as this team that wrote songs but it

00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,200
actually rarely happened that way right

00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:42,179
most commonly these two guys would go

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,279
off write songs and once they have the

00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,960
song pretty much finished or ready for

00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,159
feedback then they've come together and

00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,110
share what they were working on right

00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,789
they only collaborated once they're

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,890
ready for suggestions and they always

00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:54,090
define who is the lead songwriter

00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,090
and who was there to actually offer

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:59,100
suggestions and input the Wright

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,810
brothers not all that different all

00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,210
right they invented flight within

00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:05,130
constraints Orville was a very

00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,590
mischievous guy he dropped out of school

00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,780
yet he was incredibly intellectual right

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,030
and he just loved the tinker Wilbur on

00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:15,270
the other side was very studious right

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:17,970
bright really excelled at school excuse

00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,310
me they always shared credit for their

00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,890
innovations though right however they

00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:24,240
had a very clear division of labor orbal

00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,830
was innovative so he was in charge of

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,960
development engineering right

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,580
predominantly most of what we do will

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,320
blow on the other side very sharp

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,540
instincts right so he's on the business

00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,030
executive and actual operational side of

00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,100
that and when Wilbur died or we'll had

00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,840
to take over his brothers role and

00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,630
become the president of the right

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,950
company and he hated it in fact so much

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,530
that three years after his brother

00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,540
passed he sold the entire company I was

00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,250
like look I have a very clear role this

00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,310
just isn't what I want to do and he got

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:55,290
out of it we need to work together by

00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:57,180
self-organizing right we have to

00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:00,180
understand and recognize that none of us

00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,800
is as good as all of us these teams that

00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,300
share a common direction in a sense

00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,510
community they get where they're going

00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,890
much quicker much easier right we have

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,870
to let the most qualified group of

00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,820
people lead and make decisions we have

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,610
to step up when that's us and we have to

00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,600
support others when it's not right we

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,670
can use the idea of collaboration

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,380
contracts to place clarity around our

00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:21,510
roles and give the team a shared

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,460
responsibility and we can let creativity

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,530
come from the idea of constraints and

00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,350
collaboration inside that collaboration

00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,900
contract now I mentioned I grew up in

00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:33,450
Ohio it's a bit different than the

00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:37,560
weather here right our winters they're

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:40,020
horrible it mostly rain snow you call it

00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,610
and one winter specifically it would

00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:44,250
rain all day and then that rain would

00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:46,200
freeze at night and over time a few

00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,720
inches of ice started to build on top of

00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,190
the trees thank God my tree was okay it

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,320
was too small to actually be taken down

00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,880
by the ice but a lot of trees actually

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,950
started to fall because of the weight of

00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,560
the ice taking down power lines society

00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,720
you name it with it and my father was an

00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,770
athletic trainer and he had some time

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,760
he's like you know what as these trees

00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,070
are falling down I'm going to go out

00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,290
there and start cutting them up

00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,270
and as he was cutting one of the trees a

00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:11,060
piece of bark flew off the blade of his

00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,490
chainsaw and got stuck in his retina not

00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,200
a good good place to be so my mother

00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,520
took him to the ER and they were able to

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,680
get it out and things look like they

00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,420
were going to be all right and I was a

00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,210
kid at the time in the most interesting

00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,940
part to me sadly was that for rehab

00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:28,430
doctors constrained his good eye and I

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,290
was like why would they do that dad he's

00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,270
like well the idea is that if they

00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,940
constrain my good eye it forces my bad I

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,100
to work twice as hard the doctors don't

00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,620
want to allow my good eye to ever have

00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,690
the option to overcompensate for my bad

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,940
I it's known as constraint induced

00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:45,950
therapy right the idea was to push my

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,200
father out of his comfort zone but not

00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:51,100
let his good i overcompensate for his

00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,270
bad I said all right that makes sense

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,220
now a few months later when the weather

00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,300
subsided I was outside playing with a

00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,100
few my friends and I ended up breaking

00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,590
my humerus which is the largest bone in

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,330
your arm I did this by landing on my

00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,830
elbow my arm behind my back so it's like

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:06,800
a spiral fracture which the bone just

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:09,770
sort of I won't explain it you guys get

00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:12,800
but uh so my father the athletic trainer

00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:15,080
I ran to and I was holding my arm and

00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,020
because I landed on my elbows like dad

00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,190
like I I broke my arm he's like well how

00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,480
do you know that I was like because if I

00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,320
let go of it kind of swings like a

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,420
pendulum I don't really have control

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,760
over it and he's like well it sounds

00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:27,320
broke let me look at it he's kind of

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,360
like polka my elbow because that's where

00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,950
I land and he's like yeah I think your

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,170
elbow is fine like structurally it feels

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,210
pretty good and I looked at him in that

00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,770
one good eye on the one decent ish I

00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:40,220
house like I don't think that constraint

00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,870
news therapy worked and the joke was on

00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,850
me because three months later the

00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,680
doctors put me into that exact same

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,810
therapy alright so when they took the

00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,790
cast off of my right arm doctors put my

00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,650
left arm in a sling and I looked at the

00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,180
doctor I was like are you seriously you

00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,920
operated on that other arm what are you

00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,220
doing like you tell me you know that's

00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,570
please he's like yeah CheY same story

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,130
right you're going into constraint news

00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,690
therapy we want to make sure that you

00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,700
use that bad arm we want to make sure

00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,800
you actually take the time to tie your

00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,290
shoes with it right do all that and

00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,820
never have the opportunity for your left

00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,830
arm to overcompensate for your right arm

00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,080
and I would cheat I'd be like wiggling

00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,310
my arm inside the sling and then my

00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,020
father would wrap my arm

00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,580
to my chest I was a kid walking around

00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,480
fifth grade with an arm taped to his

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:25,430
chest but eventually it worked right the

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,200
idea of that constraint allowed me to

00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,490
grow and strengthen my bad arm and now I

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,520
don't have a good or a bad arm I'm

00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:33,290
pretty good with all of my arms now this

00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,300
is Darby Darby is a co-worker and a

00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,890
really good friend of mine fortunately

00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,350
not injured in this presentation so

00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,060
that's good for Darby Darby is a back in

00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,850
engineering he's got a pretty opposite

00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:45,350
skill set of that of myself and for one

00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,940
project we decided to kind of swallow

00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,950
our fears that we were going to switch

00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,930
roles we're going to take this idea of

00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,910
constraint induced therapy and try it

00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,320
with one another right and we were each

00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,960
going to take that time to work on our

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,010
weakest skill sets right all the while

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,590
we're going to help each other out and

00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:02,990
get through this I constrain myself to

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,430
back in development I know a bit of Ruby

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,720
like I can work my way around a code

00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,850
base but I never actually modeled

00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,680
something out from the core that's what

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,480
I did I jumped in I modern up the

00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,250
database the actual application I wrote

00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,020
all the controllers right i developed a

00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,480
routing system all things that were

00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,580
foreign to me before right I handled and

00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,340
learned all things back and related for

00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,630
a project Darby did the opposite Darby

00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,000
went out and spoke with customers he

00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:28,760
performed research he created wireframes

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,860
set up usability test right jumped into

00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:34,370
visual design he was handling and

00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,870
learning all things design now cause

00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,700
Smith said this really well he said

00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,980
avoid making decisions based off fear

00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,960
greed focused on what feels right and

00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,480
helps the people in your life well

00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,710
Durbin I did was not normal right but we

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,810
ignored our fears and we created

00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,280
constraints from one another we wanted

00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:51,080
to take those constraints and allow us

00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,030
to focus on our weaknesses all the while

00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,140
again helping each other out we're

00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,060
trying to push each other in new

00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,980
directions because we did that we're

00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:00,170
ever learn new skills and the actual

00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,120
ability for diamond I to communicate is

00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,580
so much stronger today than it ever has

00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,800
been right when I take a bit of user

00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,480
feedback to Darby and he sees that the

00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,460
changes that are going to echo down into

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,530
the actual database he knows the weight

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,450
that those come with and when Darby

00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,310
comes to me and talks about how we need

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:19,250
to throttle some of our ABI calls and

00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:20,840
actually fix that side of it hey I kind

00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,280
of know what the words are today I know

00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,330
the complexity involved in that and what

00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,950
it's actually going to take to get that

00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,740
stuff done and we can work really

00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:28,910
tightly around that we have to use these

00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,629
constraints though to exploit our

00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,609
weaknesses

00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:33,859
right try and take those weaknesses and

00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:35,539
turn them into our advantages we can be

00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:38,240
more innovative if we think about how we

00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:40,129
face our fears and it's very easy to

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,710
stress on what you don't know and I have

00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:44,299
to encourage you not to do that right

00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,740
challenges are really healthy right

00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:47,599
you'll learn something new you'll be

00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,009
more confident in your role and my

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,259
general thought is so long as you're

00:34:49,009 --> 00:34:52,849
uncomfortable it's very highly probable

00:34:51,259 --> 00:34:56,480
that you're growing and what you're

00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:58,549
doing now Miles Davis wrote kind of blue

00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,920
without the use of a single chord right

00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:03,200
that album is quadruple platinum he sold

00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,630
over 4 million albums it's incredible

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,880
the artist Piet Mondrian helped start

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,529
monetarism but giving him the self the

00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,980
constraint of 90 degree angles and

00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:15,230
primary colors right if there was ever a

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:18,200
runner-up to king of constraints behind

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:21,170
MacGyver it's dr. Seuss he wrote Cat in

00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,119
the Hat with 225 words his publisher

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,920
thought that was a joke and said well I

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,339
bet you couldn't write a book with fewer

00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,880
words he said challenge accepted he

00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:34,059
wrote green eggs and ham with 50 words

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,180
49 of those words are only one syllable

00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:39,890
right runner up to key constraints

00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,809
thinking about what we do today right

00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,880
twitter is constrained 240 characters

00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:46,009
per tweet that's the original size of a

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,230
text message google has given themselves

00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:50,390
the constraint that they will only have

00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,509
no more than 28 words on their homepage

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:55,819
at a given time right the iphone in its

00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:57,799
original ization was constrained to one

00:35:55,819 --> 00:36:00,109
button and mobile devices as a whole

00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:02,690
have constraints everywhere right screen

00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:05,539
size orientation bandwidth battery life

00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:08,480
you name it that list goes on and on and

00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:10,789
on now we have design and development

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,130
frameworks but I think perhaps we could

00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:15,109
use a framework for constraints right

00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,819
and if I could I would propose this I'd

00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:18,859
say let's make decisions with fewer

00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:22,009
resources right let's improve our

00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:23,539
consistency with regulation let's focus

00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:26,269
by removing some of those distractions

00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:28,519
let's work together by self organizing

00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:31,819
and let's innovate by moving out of our

00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:33,829
comfort zone now people don't like the

00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:35,839
idea of constraints though a lot of

00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:37,490
people tell me Shay the constraints

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,130
actually hinder our capabilities they

00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,600
put us in a box it's not great I have to

00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,920
disagree

00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,570
with them right I believe we have

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,730
constraints for really good reasons

00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:48,010
right they offers guidance for what's

00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,360
relevant what's topical they let us know

00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,670
what's actually off course of what we're

00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,900
doing and we cannot confuse working

00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,630
within constraints with making

00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,310
sacrifices now going back to where we

00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,710
started right that childhood playground

00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:02,050
the constraints the rules they're there

00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,700
for a reason they make that playground

00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,950
much safer much more enjoyable for

00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,420
everyone involved I think we have to

00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,850
take that in I think we have to embrace

00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:12,070
those constraints and take our turn to

00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:14,670
go on the swings that's what I have

00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,670
thank you

00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,600
I believe we have just a few minutes for

00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:32,080
questions before the break if anyone has

00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:34,870
one yes the time tracking applet it's

00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,040
it's like a pomodoro app I can I don't

00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,320
know the name of it I can look it up for

00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,730
it yeah if you just go to like the app

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:45,210
store and search pomodoro you're gonna

00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:45,210
see it with the tomato guarantee it yes

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:51,910
he did yeah he escapes so the side story

00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,650
there when I was researching this talk

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,320
and thinking about it there was one

00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,880
episode where the writers of MacGyver

00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,350
suggested anyone could write in their

00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,510
ideas around something that they

00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,880
believed was was true that could happen

00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,710
in like that's an actual thing that you

00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,570
could do and one of those was that you

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,240
could plug bullet holes on a radiator

00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:12,100
with egg whites so that was like an

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,770
audience suggestion that the riders love

00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,750
actually tested worked and put into the
