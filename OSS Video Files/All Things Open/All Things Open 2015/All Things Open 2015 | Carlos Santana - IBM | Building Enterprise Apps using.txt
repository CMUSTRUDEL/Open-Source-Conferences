	00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:12,630
it starts to intro so that's that's when

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,849
I we're going to talk about more of the

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,289
experience a lot of people talk about

00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:18,180
creating an app and whatever I put in

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,949
the app kind of putting it is kind of

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,039
putting an Android I want to talk more

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,720
about the other aspects of creating

00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,960
creating an experience right you have to

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,640
think about the back end the data how

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,340
people how they app will connect is it

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,180
fast its briefs responsive does it run

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,360
everywhere and as I asked javascript

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,120
folks here is it easy to build if I know

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,370
just JavaScript and enough a little bit

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,450
of everything else can I build a mobile

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:52,070
app that that I can get to work by

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,530
myself even if it's a weekend project so

00:00:52,070 --> 00:01:01,590
my name is Carlos Santana that's my

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:03,840
Twitter handle I came from Puerto Rico

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,490
in 2002 so I've been living in raleigh

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,070
any guys outside from raleigh visiting

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:13,650
ok cool welcome I've been living here 13

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,070
years and I'm so hard for so far very

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,650
happy I have a wife and 11 year old

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,140
daughter went to NC State got my

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,290
master's there so any wolf packs and

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,950
house okay don't be shy there's also

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,900
other people I make a committer for

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,310
Apache Cordova Cordova is the same thing

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,460
as phonegap that's we're going to

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:39,180
discuss today and I'm an ionic fan so I

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,530
I found that I learned angular ionic is

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,829
an angular framework so I learned

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,990
angular through ionic so a very

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:51,750
interesting project and have got to meet

00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:56,700
the people behind it and they're pretty

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:58,979
cool that if you want to follow me look

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,530
for the guy in the Hat that's not me

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,469
that's the other ones if you hit this

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,829
one is not me so search for the other hi

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,869
other guy in the Hat that's me see

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,370
Santana

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:15,170
what's taken so i added PR their

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:19,730
architecture I don't have a lot of

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:22,010
slides so I like to build deal more with

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,440
code that slides so this is a short

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,420
short version of what we're going to

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,299
build today is basically we're going to

00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,400
have a social app where you can send

00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:34,610
messages to your friends everybody's in

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,730
a group chat everybody has a different

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,709
phone they have Android or iOS or

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,129
Android or iOS can that's kind of the

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:46,269
landscape in their market I'm going to

00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:49,220
talk about trig technologies nodejs

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:53,629
Cloudant which is a CouchDB based

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:55,239
database no sequel document base and if

00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:57,500
we have time we can talk about Watson

00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,859
one of the things that we're doing in

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,700
IBM and all that will run in the cloud

00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:06,379
so I couldn't leave an IBM presentation

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,530
without mentioning cloud right cloud

00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:13,010
needs to be everywhere and our cloud is

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:16,940
named IBM bluemix that's where we have

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:18,549
our cloud services so the first

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,480
technology we're going to talk about is

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:27,919
web sockets WebSockets is not where RTC

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:30,139
websockets help is an HTTP base the

00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:34,340
problem that is solving is HTTP wasn't

00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:37,459
created for this type of apps that we

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,500
want to build it always was about client

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,389
request response so there's always a

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,220
request as a response to that client has

00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:48,199
to start the communication there's

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,959
nothing when the HTTP what wasn't be

00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:52,790
bidirectional so that the things that we

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,370
want to build our real-time apps apps

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,609
that are connected fast like multi

00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,349
multiplayer games in this case we're

00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:02,660
going to do instant messaging app a very

00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:04,220
simple app where if somebody sends a

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,019
message you want to quick get it quickly

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,879
the same thing somebody's drawing

00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,359
something in there the browser everybody

00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,280
wants to see the the drawing or the

00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:16,160
pointer moving as the person speaks

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,919
right that's type of application so web

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,900
sockets you say it's a standard that is

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,970
established and is supporting almost I

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,740
think every every browser every late

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,560
lay the latest version of a grocer

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,500
support web sockets and i will say even

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,710
n minus one supports web sockets um can

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,930
can i use dot com it's a good website if

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,490
you google for can i use if you give you

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,530
all the browsers that support that and

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,449
for those that don't i'll give you

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,740
another project that will help in that

00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:50,460
area like I said web sockets is is it's

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,349
better for real-time obstacles you have

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,479
to establish a communication so that

00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:56,690
first client opens a request to the

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,130
server and he leaves that soak it open

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,840
by leaving the circuit open the server

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,690
can start communication back to that

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,090
client and start sending messages so

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,849
it's a message to even architecture and

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,830
then the the api's are very web what

00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:13,289
like you listen an event on you you

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,539
react on an event so you have a call

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,039
back in there so that's that's the

00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,470
beauty of web sockets and again

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,659
WebSockets is not WebRTC WebRTC is a

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,430
different standard which is more related

00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:26,099
to real-time communication like sound

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:30,419
and video WebSockets is it's a more

00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:34,380
basic protocol so web sockets in action

00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:38,820
this is a node node wrap nodejs app is

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:43,289
using the NPM package WS and as you can

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:46,740
see on the right side is the the web

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:50,550
client it's just establishing a

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,159
connection a WebSocket connection to to

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,310
the server one one thing that what

00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:59,370
sockets do is it's their responsibility

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,889
of the server to deal with cross domain

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,310
so the browser will doesn't care what

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:07,349
what domain you connecting to once you

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,419
establish a connection on the other end

00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:11,669
for for the server it's very simple you

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,979
listen on a connection you listen on a

00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:17,009
message and then to send a message back

00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:21,180
to that same connection you just send WS

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:24,240
and so I will say we 12 12 lines of code

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,110
you actually have a real app real-time

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:32,010
app up and working the other version of

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:35,310
it is socket i/o so can I oh is kind of

00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,569
what most people use it uses the package

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,909
WS

00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:41,249
sockets but it is more reliable because

00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:42,719
it deals with a lot of things that if

00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:46,949
you use web sockets you see kind of

00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:48,569
related raw raw metal like raw AP is so

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,719
good I owe helps you because it has a

00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:54,839
nice API of broadcasting to all clients

00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:57,719
are connected it also helps you for the

00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:59,309
heartbeat so when sockets are open you

00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:00,929
need kind of a heartbeat to let that

00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:04,860
server node that a i'm still out of life

00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:06,659
I my client with the just plain sockets

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,939
you have to build that in so the this

00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:11,339
project is very very popular because of

00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,770
that and the last thing that most people

00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:16,050
use it is because if you don't have a

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,539
browser or web view that supports web

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,639
sockets they do lon pooling so they will

00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,990
pull back to the server so you as a

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,449
developer you don't have to think about

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,089
like all these constraints it's ok dile

00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:28,860
solves that for you and their web

00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:31,099
sockets are implementing another web

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,179
server technologies not know Jas is not

00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:38,189
legit Java and other ones support this

00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:42,110
so like it like I said so can I always

00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:44,729
kind of a platform as a service solution

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,379
like web sockets is supported everywhere

00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:48,629
I think I mentioned all the other

00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,699
property so wat saket if you're going to

00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:54,300
go like use these in a business

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,979
production we have other types excess

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,339
solution so if you want to set solution

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:01,319
like more than 100 100 devices movie you

00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:03,449
don't want to manage all the messaging

00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,469
and cue the messaging and catch the

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:10,349
messaging and have fast responses around

00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:13,319
the world I'll recommend a data stream

00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:15,479
network and bob nobb is some it's a

00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,779
service that IBN collaborated with our

00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:22,319
cloud so you can get a that service

00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:24,959
through IBM bluemix or directly from

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,729
them but if you using bluemix as a

00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,249
crowdfunding app it's very easy to get

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:32,579
an account connect it and then use it

00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:34,229
inside your your runtime so we have

00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:38,039
different runtimes you can be no Jas or

00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:40,319
or Java or PHP we have a bunch of

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,849
runtimes so i recommend to look into

00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:46,319
poppin up if you're going serious of

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:48,920
building like a like a real real app for

00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:50,460
tuefel for a large large network devices

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,100
or if you

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,140
want to go around the world but for

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,940
simple simple projects socket i/o is a

00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,650
good starting point until you get some

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,270
MVP app right something that works

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,460
something that you can show value that

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,950
you can iterate on your user experience

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,500
and then he's swapping the api's it's

00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:10,350
like very very easy because it sits at

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,150
the end of the day but nub supports the

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,880
browser so you're using WebSockets the

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,500
browser doesn't have anything else that

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,240
is Magic to support web sockets this

00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,770
it's built into the into the browser

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,300
Apache Cordova is dollar side of the

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:28,500
application that we're going to show

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:31,890
today is a there was a actually a great

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,960
good talk to debut missed it they may

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,410
have a recording from John wargo he's

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,900
back there you can say hi to him he

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:43,110
wrote a book actually many books on on

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,720
Apache Cordova past record of ice if you

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:51,570
you may know it by phonegap allows you

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:54,240
to build apps you seen we put a lot of

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,070
people with html5 it's basically

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,910
JavaScript it's a JavaScript API

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:02,670
framework the thing that it gives you is

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,730
kind of dueling packaging a web view and

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,190
a JavaScript API to native Native api's

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,320
from from the phone it doesn't give you

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,260
that other things that other native SDKs

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,700
gives you like UI controls for lease for

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,350
buttons and things like that and that's

00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,720
that's where where people get confused

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,540
about Patrick Cordova saying well worse

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,020
where's the rest I just I just got this

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,570
and where do I build the white my apps

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,100
are slower this is HTML but it's for the

00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,760
mobile so how do I make it look like a

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,520
native app where Cordova is very good

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,040
it's being a rapper so other tooling

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,320
like I'm going to show to the ionic and

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,850
other frameworks use Cordova a building

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,370
block so it's a part of the passion

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,830
foundation open source project and

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,720
direct access to their native API so

00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,610
this is something that other projects

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,340
are taking advantage so Cordova's kind

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:56,480
of a good base for other other

00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:59,820
frameworks to build on on top of it

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,310
phonegap and Cordova slow so who have

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,720
heard that fungi apps are slow or have

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,270
that myth

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,430
okay I I heard too I'm for certain

00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,589
applications they are but for most

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,400
applications they're not and there's

00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:17,710
many factors to it one big one is

00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,470
devices are fast so the technology

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,750
dealing about web views or the web be

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,270
embedded with the phone didn't get

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,660
faster actually the phones get faster I

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:32,050
got a success and it has a dual core two

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:34,570
gigs of ram so people are starting to

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,510
get phones that are faster and not not

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:40,000
not noticing that another breakthrough

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:43,630
that that the Cordova project was

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,270
pluggable web views right now the

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:48,279
crosswalk is out is released is for

00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:51,130
android so this is a project from Intel

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:56,020
so Intel created a plug of wet view call

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:57,550
crosswalk and si si si it's a web view

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,430
that is built with the latest chrome

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,160
they package it and then you can run it

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,910
on old Android devices so for example

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:09,310
android 4.0 4.1 if you use the system

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,020
web view it's very slow and it doesn't

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,839
have the new AP is that you may want to

00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,400
use but we cross what you will not use

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,100
that web view and you will use the grass

00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,589
work across all these android phones and

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,450
will be fast and the API will be the

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:24,580
same and with the latest so that's kind

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,140
of a breakthrough that we did so you

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,110
will start seeing a lot of Cordova apps

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:32,290
just using cross work by default another

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:35,410
one that is kind of almost released its

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,770
there's plugins out there is WK WK web

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:41,770
view it's for iOS so the the web view

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,240
from Mobile Safari is faster than the

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,900
web view that you get inside a Cordova

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:50,050
app so with WK webview is a kind of

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,150
next-generation uiwebview for iOS and

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,820
the same concept applies when you can

00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:57,760
run the system web view uiwebview or you

00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,400
can run the stir this are tentative

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,160
DeLuca web view which is WebKit basis

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,930
the new one is app is going to go with

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,980
with that one going forward and I guess

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,720
the other one they're going to deprecate

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:13,000
it and the last one is performance and

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,070
optimization there's a lot of like

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,579
techniques that people using to create

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,689
web views they take into a

00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:19,879
count that they're running on a phone

00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:24,860
the feature detection so that makes apps

00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:28,670
faster ionic is a it's an angular based

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:33,100
framework i would say that there's a lot

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:37,429
of examples and out of the box tutorial

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:40,160
components or CSS or JavaScript that at

00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:43,220
least for me may very easy to learn

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,910
angular and I'm not an angular expert

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,549
but I can create a decent sample apps

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,929
using ionic without being an angular

00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:53,089
expert because there's a lot of

00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:56,149
declarative things that you do you do

00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:59,480
HTML so you say view model kind of

00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:01,879
framework and and the good thing that is

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,429
that's where the html5 comes in that's

00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,779
why I didn't say Cordova html5 these are

00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:09,379
the framework that builds on top of

00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:12,829
Cordova and give you the html5 so ionic

00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:14,360
has different tools the framework is one

00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:17,269
of them that you use a runtime another

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:22,519
one is a CLI so the CLI uses the cordova

00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:27,410
CLI are to create the apps so i'm going

00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:32,540
to show you a quick demo of the server

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:34,220
first so for the server if you all have

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,480
these lights and with the links

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:42,139
available so i have a github project

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:44,410
that is a structure as a ionic app or

00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:46,639
cordova app you have your dodo folder

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,009
you have the hooks folder you have your

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:53,239
platform folders actually the platform

00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:55,009
the plugins are empty but the thing that

00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:57,649
i did with this project is it can be

00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:59,269
also be used as a as a website so the

00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:02,449
same code that runs on the website will

00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:05,569
run on the phone and do to get it up and

00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:08,689
running and to the fastest way to try it

00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:11,600
out you can go to my github project and

00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:14,809
just click this button it will deploy it

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,839
will open in bloomix bloomix is you can

00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:20,419
get a free account in bluemix and click

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,999
the deploy button i'm not going to do

00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:25,809
that because the demo go God's maybe

00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:28,110
again against me but I'll show you a

00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:32,790
short video that I did

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:35,130
early today and it can take three from

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,870
three to five minutes basically what

00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,899
it's doing is taking that github project

00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:43,279
it has a manifest file and doing a gig

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:46,260
clone and instantiating a no Jas service

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,170
and in this version that i upgraded

00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,180
recently it also has a declaration for

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,540
our Cloudant which is the couch TV

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,600
database or casual couch TV base

00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:00,510
database and and literally in three

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:05,220
minutes which this one took around three

00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:06,899
minutes you have a live URL you I didn't

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,740
show that but you give it a name and

00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:13,709
then my case will be ionic my blue mixed

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,750
dotnet and and you can walk out of here

00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:18,269
if you do it now you'll be walking out

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:23,570
with a with ionic website that can that

00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:26,310
can work so that's that's the end of it

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,800
you you can you can click view your app

00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:31,170
which will show you in the bluemix

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,779
dashboard I can show that or you can

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,910
edit the code one good thing that I like

00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,370
about this not because this IBM but I

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,399
guess it does but other other aspects

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:44,370
other products that do this is they you

00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,890
can have a DevOps workflow where you can

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:50,579
change the code push the code into the

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,620
gate repository and you know in a minute

00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:56,550
that code will be live and running in

00:16:52,620 --> 00:17:00,000
that in that in that HTTP web site other

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:02,699
other tools do that and at least for my

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,280
workflow what I do is either have two

00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,630
branches one def and one production and

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,370
when I'm ready to put something in

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,280
production and just get push my

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:13,290
exchanges to the to the production

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,600
branch and its life in this particular

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,730
case what I have is a github so I do

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,679
development on github and we're ready to

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,049
have the app up and running and just

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,319
push the changes into the get that I get

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:29,850
for free through bluemix and my app is

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:32,640
up and running so let's say I did this I

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,559
can show you the dashboard that I have

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,130
and that this this is the one I did at

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,530
lunch so I got it I got a nap in here

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,490
and then if you run this app and you

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,309
guys can

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,160
can join your mobile phone or your

00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:50,280
laptop you will see that you can join

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,890
the conversation in here and I just took

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,850
a picture that's the other aspect going

00:17:52,890 --> 00:18:06,890
to show so i can say hello in here if I

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:10,350
open another window on doing with time I

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:19,530
can go to that website and chat with you

00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:24,450
guys can be Carlos staff I can log in as

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:27,380
Carlos legal and I can have a chat app

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:30,740
up in five minutes up and running so

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:37,350
anyone can tell me who are these avatars

00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:39,630
from what movie yeah ghostbusters for

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:43,410
some reason and guys like to use the go

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:46,590
busters avatars so it's instant so this

00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:49,530
is going through this https one thing

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,059
that I did I force https for this

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,530
connection and one of the reasons is

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:57,690
because the new iOS 9 or x equals 7 by

00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,290
default requiring you to have HTTPS and

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:03,120
i will see i will see in the coming

00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:06,840
months of years everything moving to

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,429
HTTPS so i got https for free and in

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:14,280
five minutes is up and running and i can

00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:17,880
i can test stuff so that's that's the

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:21,650
instant shot that you can have up and

00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:25,350
running in and the code is very small

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:27,630
you want to see the code i will use

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:31,710
Visual Studio code is this a good text

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:38,090
editor I'll show you here is the server

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:38,090
yes you see if I can show this

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:46,470
not make it bigger for some reason but

00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,980
the code that I show at the beginning is

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:53,250
this it's the same code it's not more co

00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,410
than when i get a message so there's

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,150
these that you can detect like you see

00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,520
some chat apps that says typing like

00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:02,730
somebody's typing something that's

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,490
dancing here you can you can detect

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:08,580
those those changes and send it but the

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:10,680
gutter it is about these ten lines on on

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:14,070
when you get a message you go ahead and

00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:17,070
broadcast it to to everyone you broke

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:19,260
ass broadcast that I made the new

00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,150
message to everyone and another thing

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,520
that I'm doing here is if the message

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:26,370
contains a picture I'm going to save it

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,370
to the database so that way i can

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:31,380
analyze it later or make it available

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:34,260
offline so that's that's the next thing

00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:37,400
I'm going to show and we catch the beer

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:41,940
or cloud and there's a NPM package call

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,570
i think is Cloudant if i have it here

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,910
yeah so if you look in npm for Cloudant

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,800
it's very easy to use the database you

00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,750
get an instance of your Cloudant you

00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,660
will use cloud foundry which is the open

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:57,390
source project to host our services in

00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:59,370
the cloud and you get your credentials

00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,380
from from cloud services so this is not

00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:04,410
IBM property Larry this is cloud foundry

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,390
a calendaring app so you can just take

00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:08,700
this this code and deploy to and maybe

00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:16,260
another cloud provider that that is

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:18,480
co-founder compatible so I have a a like

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,210
I did what that deployment did it was a

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,250
database I can save that image with a

00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,860
simple command in this case I'm just

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:30,600
doing a DVD insert and inserting that

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:35,700
data and saving it to Cloudant so that's

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:39,450
the know Jas a portion of it in terms of

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:46,310
the ionic app this same code has the

00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:46,310
ionic app so if I do ionic platform LS

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,899
see if it gives me the information it

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,720
does it tells me that I have a version

00:21:53,899 --> 00:22:00,169
of the ionic gap see you lie but you can

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,600
see I have ionic I have android and iOS

00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:11,049
those are the cordova platform-style

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:11,049
added to it if i do ionic plug-in LS

00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:19,519
these are some plugins i added to the to

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:21,409
the to the project so i have the camera

00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,990
have console which is comes by default a

00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:27,139
whitelist allows android to get

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:29,630
connections today to the internet as you

00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:31,820
can see here I have sqlite storage so

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,960
someone in the previous talk was asking

00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,700
like how do you how do you store

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,460
information if you want to make it

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,830
available offline to the phone sqlite is

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,889
a good a good storage solution he

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:46,309
provides web web SQL JavaScript API s

00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:51,049
and then I have an ionic plugging

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:54,500
keyboard so if you want to start with

00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:58,850
ionic very simple demo is if you create

00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:01,340
let's go to empty directory if you can

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,950
type ionic when you stop I anak you have

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,600
to install the cordova CA line but you

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,039
can use you can start with either one

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,649
you can start with the cordova CLI and

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,690
then I ionic framework or at start with

00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:14,389
ionic CLI and then basically that

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:17,210
creates your cordova app with a hello

00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:21,620
hello world template of ionic so if you

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:26,110
do ionic start let's say side menu or

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,110
just just start and the name of the app

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,159
see if it can this runs with the

00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:33,159
internet

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:47,250
and this we created cordoba app I think

00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:52,470
if you run it on a mac at you the iOS

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:57,390
platform by default if if you're running

00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:59,580
on on on windows I think androids but

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:02,299
i'm not sure but you can do a platform

00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:08,630
at iOS or android and i will add the

00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:08,630
project it's taking longer right

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,820
you receive this finished

00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,950
well let that go but at at the end will

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,480
create a app for the structure like this

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,880
one you have a platform folders a

00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,030
plug-in folder you see if you can see

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,280
that you guys can see that that better a

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:42,590
platform folder you see the Android and

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:44,960
iOS folder you get the CSS folder I'm

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:48,830
going to show added a few libraries to

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,840
devour or you can do ionic add so some

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:54,140
libraries that I have is of course

00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,750
angular but at a moment moment jess is a

00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,880
nice lava script javascript library I

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:02,870
found it's basically to print those

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,960
messages that I show I that it shows you

00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:09,830
how long this message was sent like a

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,170
day ago an hour ago a minute ago and and

00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:15,340
it will show you that very very cool

00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:19,520
another one is ng cordova ng cordova a

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:22,250
angular kind of like team or or helper

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,190
library to allow you to if you have an

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:27,140
angular app to equate services so it

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:31,120
gives you services to access the cordova

00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:35,420
plugins so i use this one for the camera

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,790
ng storage I think I yeah and you

00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:40,130
storage was a cig it's a little shim

00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:42,770
that allows you to with angular to do

00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:44,540
local storage or session storage so I'm

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:48,200
using that to save the avatar and the

00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:52,730
name of the person and then pouch DB is

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:56,510
a open source project that allows you to

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:59,960
create a database on the browser so in

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:02,990
this case using web SQL or you can use

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,010
index DB so i'm i'm configuring pouch

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:08,420
the pouch TV websites web SQL and

00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,310
remember that i was just in SQLite so

00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,130
instead of saving the information on the

00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:15,140
browser when you're running on the phone

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:17,480
you'll be saving it to sqlite on the

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,670
hard drive so you have more than five

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,000
max you can have up to like I don't know

00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:26,750
a gig or two gigs of information that it

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,840
can leave offline on the phone as simple

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:32,390
as a regular native app which sometimes

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,430
that's kind of like the bottleneck what

00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,840
the profit I people just native app for

00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,730
the wrong reasons sometimes they choose

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,860
native because I got there

00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:43,070
to save files or safe a lot of data on a

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,450
on a phone and with JavaScript at the

00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,640
end of the day you're building a native

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,160
app is just it's just you're accessing

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,470
those that information on that API to

00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,710
the JavaScript API so that's that's the

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:59,390
only difference so let's show how that

00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:01,580
looks received is finished this this

00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:06,860
didn't want to finish I don't know what

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:10,160
what happened but i'll show you once you

00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:13,640
create you create your project one thing

00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:21,320
that you can do is run it the way you

00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:24,320
run it run it here you can do ionic run

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:28,870
or ionic emulate or you can just open

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,870
the xcode project

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:41,000
and this is exco so at the end of the

00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:43,220
day you're building a native app but the

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,050
good thing is you start slow by using

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,790
web technologies where you feel

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,230
comfortable and little by little you

00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,030
start learning the tools and little by

00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:53,090
little you start learning like what are

00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:56,240
the heart of Android works how to use

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:58,070
the Android studio how to use xcode so I

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,190
give you capabilities on learning how

00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:07,750
these and native SDKs work if you click

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:07,750
play that she'll learn the simulator or

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:15,550
lunch it on my phone i think is lunching

00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,550
on my phone

00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:25,420
it created for me so when I do I only go

00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:28,060
up from ad so this this version I added

00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,710
a little bit of a halloween-themed so

00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,140
the idea is that I was brainstorming

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,510
this app with my daughter and we wanted

00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:37,510
to create an app that we can put in a TV

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:38,740
so where the guests are taking pictures

00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,290
of the kids are taking pictures

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,210
everybody can see them on a TV real time

00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:45,040
on also grandma at home which is in

00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,080
Puerto Rico she can also go to a website

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,090
and see the pictures of the Halloween

00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,740
party so that was kind of the background

00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,110
of why i created this thing and then

00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,940
said I well why not create a demo and an

00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,760
a and I presentation and show people how

00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,890
i did it i know it you also say it

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,920
shared the code so in this case i will

00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:09,190
log in and as you can see to see people

00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:11,740
already sending information if i let me

00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:18,580
see if i can bring that website back so

00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:26,140
i can show information see if the demo

00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:27,910
goats are in my my side today so every

00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:31,930
did everybody got that or somebody

00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:36,960
slogging or nobody's logged in and then

00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:42,810
if oh the other thing is i'm using the

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:45,520
camera plugin let me show that code so

00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:48,640
to use the camera in cordova it's very

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:54,100
simple i have a service which is just a

00:29:48,640 --> 00:30:01,360
javascript function in here i have where

00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:04,090
is it yeah so in here i have so if i'm

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,830
in the web I'm just in a web view I will

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:09,690
take a real picture if not i will take a

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:13,450
fake picture but this is kind of the API

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:16,270
I say get pictured you pass the options

00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,370
that you want and you get back depending

00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,580
of you asking for data URI of Phi you're

00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:25,870
right you get that information back and

00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:28,840
then we saw we solve it that's that's as

00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:31,420
simple as it gets to take a picture for

00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,400
the UI if you want to show something

00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:40,970
like

00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:43,520
for example want to show you want to

00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:47,060
take a picture you can click the picture

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:53,360
button click picture and then take a

00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:57,280
picture of the room say hi or John you

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,280
want to take a selfie just to finish up

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,220
sorry

00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:14,549
what's the question sorry oh come over

00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:23,789
here so come to the front to take the

00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:25,109
selfie oh if you're you're using a

00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:32,909
website so you don't have the cordula

00:31:25,109 --> 00:31:35,190
plugin so come come here John too so in

00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:38,009
this case the website doesn't have the

00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:42,869
the picture but this one has so I can

00:31:38,009 --> 00:31:44,669
take the picture like that and it has a

00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:47,039
selfie button so you quit the Cordova

00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:52,289
plugin you can put it which which camera

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:56,190
do you want to use so that's what you

00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:59,659
get when you click the click the picture

00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:02,789
so you can create a a selfie button so

00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:05,129
with a new 3d touch of the iphones you

00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:08,279
can create a listener and create a

00:32:05,129 --> 00:32:14,700
selfie button basically and we could /

00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:16,259
have that working and since it wasn't a

00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,169
lot of time today that's that's

00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:21,149
basically it but just clicking that

00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:24,059
button give you a website if you

00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:25,559
download the code and run the ionic CLI

00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:31,200
you should be able to put it in your

00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:34,589
phone and oh the last thing was let me

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,440
show this so since I'm using cloud and I

00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:40,339
if I'm disconnected I can show my apps

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:45,960
the photos that I've been using already

00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:47,399
we see this one okay this one so from

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,289
today these are pictures that are safe

00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:52,830
in my Claire entire base so this is was

00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:54,690
early today with Chris and these are

00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,339
these are photos that are offline so I

00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:00,419
can disconnect and I have access to

00:32:56,339 --> 00:33:03,779
these photos so and that's using SQLite

00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:06,599
and pouch DB cloud and is coming has a

00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:09,269
cloud SDK coke cloud and sync for native

00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:11,369
iOS and native Android they're working

00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:12,989
currently i would say in a month or two

00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:16,320
that will come out with a Cordova

00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:18,570
plug-in with cloud NSYNC and that way

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,610
you can replace pouch to be with carbon

00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,260
sink and we

00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,460
you want to do that or you may want to

00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,770
do that is because it will provide

00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:29,679
encryption so you want to save sensitive

00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:33,200
information on the phone encrypted and

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,260
and synchronize so the API basically the

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,220
API to synchronize this data is one

00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:42,770
command is it's just replicate so it's

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,240
replicating the cloud database to a

00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,070
database on your phone so you as a

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,140
developer you're dealing with a database

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,910
locally on the phone and you cannot tell

00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,440
if it's the remote one or the local one

00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,240
all the synchronization happens in the

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,500
background and all the data get

00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,500
synchronized so if i delete something

00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,030
from the cloud it when next time it

00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,919
replicates it will delete it from the

00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,309
local device so it's a copy of the

00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:06,980
database on your phone that's kind of a

00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:09,290
kind of nice to have SDK that you get

00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,690
with this and I think the last thing I

00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,980
wanted to show was if you have an app

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:15,409
and you're saving all these pictures

00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,639
these pictures are structured data so

00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,720
that's the last piece I want to show

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,780
with with Watson Watson has some visual

00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,490
api's said you can take a set of

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,139
pictures not just one picture you can do

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,840
it with one picture and that's the

00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:33,290
picture recognition API this one is the

00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,149
visual inside so if you have a a like an

00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,399
app like here and you're collecting

00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:40,429
pictures from from a group of people or

00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:42,200
one person for business reasons or for

00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:44,210
entertainment reasons you can analyze

00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,250
those pictures and tell you more insight

00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,050
about the unstructured data in this case

00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,240
our pictures so if you go to this

00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,830
website you can play with the demo and

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,080
select these are two collections of

00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:56,659
pictures I didn't do it with this ones

00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,630
because basically we will say faces and

00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:01,310
selfies right that's not interesting but

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,930
in case like you have a group of folks

00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,700
talking about a certain topic or

00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:07,550
interested in certain topic you can

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,020
serve ads or you can serve services or

00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,630
you can learn more about your users

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,640
where were the people having that

00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,310
instruct on structured data talking

00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,859
about and if you hit it analyzed

00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:21,109
basically this API is like one post you

00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:23,480
send a post with a archive of the

00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:26,450
pictures safe in cloud and safe in

00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,609
another place and i'll give you inside

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:32,510
information on what they found on this

00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:33,710
picture so there's 46 pictures were

00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,230
around 50

00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:38,660
pictures in here and you can tell that

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:43,460
is there's a lot of outdoors blue sky

00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:45,770
there's animals there's fashion natural

00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,290
science so looks like this picture is

00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:51,109
about maybe a somebody going outside

00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:52,790
camping trip or people that like that

00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:54,770
type of things and this are maybe that

00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:57,680
the type of persons you want to target a

00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:59,570
certain ad or a certain feature or know

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,270
more about the type of usage they're

00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:05,720
doing on your app and again you get

00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:11,180
Jason back it's a REST API and it's very

00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:15,820
simple to use so with that the kind of

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:18,200
destructions are in the the slides

00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:21,010
decide the software requirements and

00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,359
then you want to get into into it to do

00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:25,070
Cordova development but it's very simple

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,040
one thing that is interesting you don't

00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:30,109
have to pay their $99 anymore to put the

00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,570
app on the only physical device on

00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:34,430
iphone I exco seven remove that

00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,410
restriction so it now it's nice and cool

00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,859
to to try it out things in the real

00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:41,780
device this is the demo that I did

00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:43,430
basically you click one button and the

00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,380
app is up and running on the website so

00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,510
you can start you can send that link to

00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,760
anyone a family member or something and

00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,410
you can start chatting or sharing

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,910
pictures a pictures don't have to be

00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:55,730
saved in the database the first version

00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:58,190
of this app I did it without saving any

00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:02,390
data just just using nodejs as a

00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:07,430
transport protocol this is the example

00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:09,980
for the ionic app and the visual insight

00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,920
and this is just in case there was no

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,260
Wi-Fi connection so that was the other

00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,150
the other set of pictures that I did so

00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,780
the other one has a lot of outdoors and

00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:25,520
animal and fashion there was a dog with

00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:28,130
sunglasses so yes fashion I think that's

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,380
it our pigs doing this all pics there's

00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:33,230
a conference going on October 19 and 20

00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:35,839
all things open so you're there go to

00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:38,390
that one podcast that I that I listen I

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:40,580
like to listen a lot of tech podcast my

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:45,140
favorite ones are JavaScript cover which

00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:47,330
I'm a JavaScript like fanatic and a

00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,040
vectors in angular if you like a

00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,570
her this is a good podcast you will

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,870
learn a lot of things going on right now

00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:56,060
for angular 2 if you are into that blog

00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:59,900
post Raymond Camden now worked for IBM

00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:02,870
if you follow Raymond he say I blogger

00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:06,950
and a developer advocate for many years

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:11,150
in Adobe he moved to IBM this year and

00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:13,700
he currently works not with me but he we

00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,500
collaborate a lot cuz I answer a lot of

00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,080
his questions around the mall offers and

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,490
the mall was gay landscape and open

00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,030
source and a Cordova and like the

00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:24,650
clinical things that is writing about

00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,690
one thing that John mentioning his talk

00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:30,050
is one way of the getting help is we're

00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:32,240
now telling people in the Cordova

00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:34,850
community to go to stark overflow but at

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,100
the same time we're using slack a lot so

00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:39,920
we're trying to to be more active in

00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,650
slack so those are the two slacks that I

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,110
currently monitor one is for ionic and

00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:47,060
184 Cordova so if you have questions on

00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:49,010
getting started or finding teen so what

00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:51,290
is the latest version of something going

00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:53,990
and sign up for for slack it's open to

00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,250
anyone unjoin and ask questions I think

00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:58,460
that's like it's becoming very popular

00:38:55,250 --> 00:39:00,560
with using in IBM so it's very very fast

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:06,230
to get feedback and collaborate with

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:09,160
folks and I went over yes I told you any

00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,160
questions

00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:50,560
so that the question was around how how

00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,599
it is to customize is using SAS so that

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,290
that thing that you did you saw like

00:39:52,599 --> 00:40:00,340
orange and purple it was a two liner so

00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:03,430
they have a theme-based SAS variables so

00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:08,770
it's very easy to to do I think I have

00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:10,630
it under SCSS we go in here you can see

00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,340
if you can see that i have one a

00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:14,980
halloween-themed and i have a bluemix

00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,390
wing and just change that and it changed

00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,550
everything else like the buttons the

00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,980
bars and everything so you can give it a

00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,680
cure your own look and feel for your app

00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,540
so that's I wanted to try it out to see

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,580
how difficult it was sunny it was very

00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,890
simple you do this and then you run gulp

00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,690
gulp task and then generate you a nice

00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:36,000
ass and the other question about the

00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:39,000
desktop you saw that this is I show the

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
website

00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:59,790
ionic this this the JavaScript the

00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:03,220
Oscars web-based so they work for

00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,869
desktop and one example is ionic lab if

00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,720
you go to the ionic Wayne work and

00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:10,359
download ionic lab is a desktop app

00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:13,990
built with ionic framework and it's a

00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:17,650
desktop app to kind of use ionic I runs

00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:19,990
on using electron Jas and you don't you

00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:22,750

00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,339
it feels native installs natively it

00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:28,030
launches natively and you cannot tell

00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:30,130
that it's a web app and use various

00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,589
