I'm gonna start seconds early just

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,280
because can someone close that back door

00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,120
that's what Todd's but do you not to get

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,070
up and do it there's some of the back

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,480
room that can do it oh she's leaving

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:21,720
okay all right so my name is John wargo

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,660
I am I'm a principal analyst at

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,310
forrester research and the topic of

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,070
today's conversation is Apache Cordova

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,700
and apparently I wasn't very enticing in

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,960
my in my title they asked me if I want

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,460
to come present on the topic I'm like

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,809
what do you want me to write about what

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,280
it is what it does and how you use it

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,910
they go yeah that's fine so I made that

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,079
my title um I wasn't kidding when I said

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,899
this is going to be kind of whirlwind

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,219
because I took an hour presentation and

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,809
scrunched it into 40 minutes but there's

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,190
a lot to it and I know a lot and so I

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,899
just thought if you're interested to

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,760
come then I'll share about your cool

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,899
information with you there's my agenda

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,579
okay everyone got that so then the first

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,809
he might ask is well why is there a

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,370
principal analyst from Forrester

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,899
Research talking about Apache Cordova is

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,340
because Forrester really loves Apache

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,780
Cordova no no not so much but every time

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,600
i say patch cord over Carlos is going to

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,340
clap so so look just a little bit about

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,830
me I'm a professional software developer

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,369
as you can tell i'm also a propeller

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,070
head geek I've written six books on

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,590
mobile development and one book on

00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,090
soccer referring and then until recently

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,130
I was a contributed Apache Cordova

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,100
project I guess technically I still am

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,229
but I just it's a question of time I

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,000
haven't contributed code I contributed

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,590
the docs and then through my books well

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,210
we'll talk about that so I'm the reason

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,409
why I'm here is because I've written a

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,869
few books so I wrote the first book on

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,780
blackberry development and then I wrote

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,610
it wasn't the first book on phonegap but

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,439
it was the best-selling book on phonegap

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,509
the reason I know that because it was

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,229
translated into Chinese as well as

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,880
Korean okay unfortunately this book is

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,250
still available and people are still

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,390
buying it I like to check I get every

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,840
six months but at the end of the day

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,649
this is about phonegap to don't buy this

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,739
book I wrote Apache for over three with

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,629
three programming which is pretty cool

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:13,540
api cookbook and then my most recent

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,879
book as if actually

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,590
for programming and so with Apache

00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,750
Cordova for I wasn't kidding about the

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,670
parting gifts with the patchy koro for

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,459
programming this is 500 pages the API

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:29,010
cookbook is 300 pages it's 800 pages on

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:31,900
Apache Cordova so that's why I'm here I

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,420
may or may not be an expert on Apache

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,609
Cordova and there's my soccer referring

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,189
book and I also being an old developer

00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:42,069
I'm IBM lotus notes and domino guy and I

00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:43,780
wrote 22 articles for lotus notes and

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,099
developer magazine about how to all the

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,470
possible ways I can figure out how to

00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,750
mobilize Domino and they published 18 of

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,400
them in an anthology so if you weren't

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,030
convinced before that i'm a geek now you

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,010
know so so what is the patchy cordova

00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,260
and this is from the web page

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,290
essentially it's a open source framework

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,859
for building cross-platform mobile apps

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,069
using html5 actually you can cross the

00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:11,620
word mobile off because it now supports

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,359
well it supported windows and OSX for

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,730
some time right so it started as a

00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,019
mobile-focused framework but now it can

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:22,000
kind of support anything although the

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:24,209
the OSX support disappeared and it

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,549
started back in two thousand eight

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:31,449
something called iphone dev camp by

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:33,459
company called nitobe and they built iOS

00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,040
and then they quickly added android and

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,449
blackberry support basically a bunch of

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,489
geeks got together for a weekend and

00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:40,810
they they wanted a way to do cross

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,979
platform in the easiest way they can

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,930
figure out how to do it was just to use

00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:47,169
web and then have a native runtime for

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,049
each in 2011 they donated the project to

00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:52,150
the apache of patchy foundation the

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,530
first they called it call back so if

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,299
your JavaScript developer you know why

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,269
then they called it device ready and

00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:59,879
then they switched it to Cordova anyone

00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,560
have any idea why it's called Cordova

00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:08,979
anyone anyone for price except for

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:10,870
Carlos anyone no no so it's that it's

00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:14,259
the name of the street that nitobe was

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:18,789
on in porto vancouver and then so

00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:20,229
literally the next kotov oh yeah well it

00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:23,099
depends on how the vancouver ian say it

00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:25,990
vancouver ians how those people up north

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:27,370
so um very quickly literally I think the

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,260
next day they donated

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,190
I nitobe got acquired by Adobe and so

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,510
really pretty interesting how they how

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,400
well they support it but ultimately I

00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,160
think happened was at the time IBM was a

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,500
big investor in Cordova roll phonegap at

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,449
the time and I think they had the

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,210
donated to Apache so that IBM and the

00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:48,550
other companies were comfortable with

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,160
adobe buying nitobe that's how I see it

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,990
and then originally the plan was for

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,820
Cordova or phonegap is what was called

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,040
at the time the plan was for it to make

00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,990
itself obsolete so the idea is that

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,720
we're going to build this interface and

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,639
largely build web apps to talk to native

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,510
API but then once the browser has those

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,520
capabilities and they're all coming

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,410
they've all pretty much shown up over

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,630
time then Cordova is going to disappear

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,930
on its own well that didn't happen and I

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,400
can explain why in a few minutes was i

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,710
okay about the energy level was I right

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,729
about the level I give you okay so

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,229
what's interesting is that the

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:22,840
smartphone industry is heavily involved

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:26,590
in Apache Cordova okay pretty much

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,300
everybody but Apple is involved no it's

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,780
funny but it's also sad at the same time

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,289
right but so adobe has 10 people or so

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,139
iBM has 10 12 people working on it five

00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:40,150
well they've been more before Google had

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,650
a team like six or seven people so these

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,120
companies have made investments and then

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,039
what's the most interesting thing for me

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,240
I don't have it up here but intel has

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,039
made a huge investment they've created

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,050
an entire toolkit for Cordova

00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,090
development which is awesome and in

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,280
Microsoft it's just I mean you heard the

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,050
keynote this morning that your Microsoft

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,060
is involved in so many aspects of open

00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,620
source they've built that as far as I'm

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,880
concerned the best tooling for Cordova

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:07,030
for iOS and Android development

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,610
Microsoft it's really cool so let's talk

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,930
about the geeky tech stuff so I

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,699
mentioned it's an open source framework

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,900
and basically what happens and the

00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:15,520
reason why I'm kind of telling a story

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,310
this way is I believe that a lot of

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,110
people misunderstand Cordova okay so I

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,419
tell you I build a web app and it runs

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,949
in a native app people believe weird

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:25,900
things about what that means so this

00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:27,580
this is verbatim Carlos will correct me

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,500
if I'm wrong but this is exactly how it

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,680
works you build your application in web

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,620
technologies you run some sort of

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,510
packaging process that takes those web

00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,430
assets and builds them into a native app

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,070
and then out comes

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,990
a native app now there's people that

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,760
think that there's some sort of trains

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,380
piling that happens or somehow the the

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,720
web content is converted in a native

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,600
stuff absolutely not the web app is

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,000
running inside a native container

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,790
nothing else okay and you might say well

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,730
big deal right am i moving around too

00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:03,070
much for you you might say big deal

00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,650
because I have the browser but basically

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,360
what happens is the webview is that so

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,760
the whole UI is comprised of maybe I

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,560
mainly a webview that web content runs

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,180
within the web view and then Cordova

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,370
does some interesting things to enable

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,820
that web application access to native

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:24,220
api's so in one point three minutes that

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:26,710
is exactly what Cordova is so what's

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,120
interesting is you monitor the devilís

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,440
and you look on tech overview and people

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,970
are like you know can I use this

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,710
framework with Cordova can use this

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,110
framework yes the answer is always yes

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,630
because it's a webview running HTML

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,030
content okay and then the next question

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,820
people ask is you know what kind of you

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:46,480
I capabilities does Cordova provide the

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,370
answer is none it's simply a mechanism

00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,530
for web applications to run in a native

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:55,270
container and for that web application

00:07:50,530 --> 00:08:01,830
have access to native api's okay all

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:05,590
right what's interesting too is that the

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:08,500
the webview has been challenging over

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:11,260
time mainly because on some mobile

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,020
devices the the webview is not the same

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,730
browser as the browser right and then in

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,110
the case of iOS for a while there Apple

00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,400
was deliberately lobotomizing the

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,930
JavaScript rendering engine in the

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,610
webview so the performance was

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,670
automatically slower in the webview than

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,650
it was in the browser all of those

00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,210
things have been fixed okay which is

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,250
really good news and in the meantime

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,100
Intel created a project called crosswalk

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,960
and crosswalk is an embeddable webview

00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,000
that is compatible with older versions

00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,290
of Android so if you're building a

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,810
Cordova app and you want it to run on

00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:43,150
multiple Android devices including older

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,650
ones use crosswalk and you can do that

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,200
and one other thing that's cool because

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,850
all of this is cool of course but the

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,370
development team the Cordova team has

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,440
built or started implementing pluggable

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,820
web views so you can use the

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
build in webview you can use crosswalk

00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,180
Carlos and I were talking this morning

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,100
about their looking and adding the

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,340
ability to do react native through a

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,570
plug-in so if you think flexibility in

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:09,460
Cordova in the same sentence you're

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:14,050
doing really well okay so any compatible

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:16,300
framework there are some hybrid specific

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,670
frameworks ionic is the one the Carlos

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,650
is going to talk about later okay but

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,020
the industry is starting to respond and

00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,820
seeing this is a good way to do things

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:28,420
so basically when the Cordova project

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:32,590
started the Cordova app was a webview

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:34,510
and then an API interface in JavaScript

00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,660
and then a bridge that connected to

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,040
native ap is okay and I apologize that

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,820
this is hard to read I was expecting a

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,260
bigger screen with Cordova three what

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,910
they did was they completely replaced

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,860
that so basically the Cordova container

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,930
contains no functionality except that

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,180
webview there's a couple little api's

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,890
like console and so on but pretty much

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,330
nothing and what they've done instead is

00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,030
they've implemented a pluggable in a

00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,770
pluggable architecture for Cordova so

00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,390
now what I do is I create a project and

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:04,090
then I only add the plugins for the

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:07,090
native capabilities I want and then the

00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:08,470
beauty that is is if I want some

00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:12,460
functionality that Cordova doesn't

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,720
create for me write a plug-in so if you

00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,090
remember a few minutes ago I said that

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,070
the curt over projects purpose was to

00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,840
make itself obsolete I said that went

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,760
away well went away because as the

00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,230
browser has added these native

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,260
functionalities like camera and

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,090
geolocation all that stuff the pluggable

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,770
architecture of Cordova gives it

00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,570
longevity because if I have some weird

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,310
API created and I don't want to do

00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:38,560
native development I can do it in

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:40,120
Cordova just make my own plugin all

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,530
right so from a tooling standpoint

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,839
what's interesting is two years ago when

00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:47,050
I first gave this presentation the

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,360
answer was there's none well two 3 years

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,700
ago Cordova has had an interesting

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,339
history but beginning with Cordova three

00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,620
they created the CLI the command line

00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:58,360
interface and so being an old guy going

00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,320
from doss to windows and back to the

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,300
command line has been kind of

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,650
interesting right but ultimately there's

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,900
a set of command line utilities there's

00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,250
two of them plug men in the CLI that

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,209
give you complete control over Cordova

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,970
project

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:12,009
and then in you would use the CLI to

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,139
Korea project manage plugins manage the

00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,970
project and then but you would use the

00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:19,240
command line to build the project or you

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,480
can use the Ides you can use Android

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:28,089
studio for Android xcode for iOS and so

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:30,670
on okay and then there's also is that in

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:32,319
it yeah third-party tools so there

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,790
weren't a lot of tools available in the

00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:35,290
past but now the vendors have really

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,209
stepped up and you need to give these

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,490
tools a look so on the on the visual

00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:41,290
studio side with visual studio you can

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,089
create a Cordova project it's a free

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,769
plug-in to visual studio and it works I

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,910
think with community version so visual

00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:48,339
studio is free in that case as well

00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,589
create a new project add an Android

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:53,079
target add an iOS target add your

00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,699
plugins to it and then when you debug it

00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,139
would launch the android emulator do

00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:58,600
live JavaScript debugging through the

00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:00,399
android emulator in visual studio yeah

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,749
it does you're shaking right yeah no

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,240
absolutely does but wait there's more

00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:06,550
but wait there's more the coolest thing

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,319
and it was amazing at phonegap day last

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:12,819
year where Microsoft came and presented

00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:16,389
on a macbook anyways is that you can do

00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:21,129
live debugging of an iOS app through a

00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:24,490
mac macintosh so you load a node module

00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:26,769
on the mac you give visual studio the IP

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,959
address and when you do a build for iOS

00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:31,899
it opens the connection that machine

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,819
passes the project files invokes xcode

00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:35,410
through the command line builds the app

00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,269
launches the emulator or launches a

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,939
physical device and does live JavaScript

00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:43,569
debugging in visual studio can I have a

00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:46,350
hell yeah yeah yeahs dimension is free

00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:50,220
and the company is doing this is

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:54,100
Microsoft I'm impressed super impressed

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,389
and then my favorite tool of choice for

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,610
web development and it's becoming my

00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:00,279
favorite tool for node development and

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,799
Cordova development is webstorm from

00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,559
jetbrains it has built in understanding

00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,540
karova in phonegap and I think ionic

00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:09,069
even and so it you do all your

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,879
development live debugging is really

00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:15,669
freaking cool things like f guyver which

00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,740
is um it's light I don't have much time

00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,689
and then gap debug is a commercial

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,310
debugging tool it's free it's really

00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:23,370
cool

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:27,029
and so the packaging process involves

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,440
the native SDKs so for platforms so

00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:30,779
platforms that don't have native like

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,910
Firefox OS for example you just make a

00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,290
zip file with the web archive or the web

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,080
content but if the other ones you need

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,850
access to the native SDK okay so if

00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,350
you're building iOS app you need a

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:45,420
Macintosh there's no getting around it

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:46,980
don't ask don't ask me for any

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:52,339
alternatives you not got to have a mac

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:55,680
okay anyways hope I didn't break that

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:57,000
but then one of the things that Adobe

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,740
did was they created phonegap build

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,720
which is a cloud-based build service for

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,850
crow at well for phonegap apps and I'll

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,839
talk about the difference in a minute so

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:09,180
you can build in the cloud but for those

00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,920
of you that are smart and and went wait

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,240
he's lying you don't have to have a Mac

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,700
you do you still have to have him back

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,740
to make the signing certificate that the

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:23,550
cloud needs to build in so you have to

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:26,130
have a mac I had uh well nevermind okay

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,839
so this is getting better over time it's

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,790
a lot better than it used to be there's

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,290
a table on the cordova website that

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,420
lists api support across multiple

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,070
platforms so as you can see there's some

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,020
pink areas where there's not full covers

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,970
but in general most of the api's you

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,730
want are supported on all the platforms

00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:44,430
if there's a pink eye there which means

00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,460
incomplete for a platform that you want

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,800
to use that's great download the code

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:56,940
fix it submit it and then that pink will

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:59,460
go away we get questions all the time

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,890
about the app stores can I put micro app

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,410
in a web store absolutely because it's a

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,959
native app so at native apps go on the

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:09,780
App Store and it complies with Cordova's

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:14,040
or Apple's guidelines because it's a web

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,930
app there are platforms that allow you

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,770
to replace the content in a Cordova app

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:21,150
over-the-air the phonegap build has

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,380
something called hydrate which is not

00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,570
supposed to be for production but it

00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,980
allows you to publish new version the

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,140
server and it gets deployed over the air

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,790
to the device I used to be product

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,890
manager for the essay p mobile platform

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,290
the hybrid SDK and it has a capability

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,079
allows you to do a pop to

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,579
over the air so um it's really cool you

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,810
can build an app to pull it and then

00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:43,190
update the web content later without

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:47,570
doing an app store update that Apple has

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:49,370
a problem alright so I mentioned

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,819
phonegap versus Cordova here's the

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:55,190
difference phonegap while the initial

00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:57,589
name for this project phonegap today is

00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,029
a product from Adobe and it's

00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:03,560
essentially a distribution of Cordova

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:06,230
until recently until about a year ago

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,579
the phonegap CLI was different than the

00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,529
Cordova sea lion which is really

00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:12,230
confusing because the documentation

00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:13,670
wasn't different but um that's kind of

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,620
been fixed so what they've done is

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,410
they've they've taken Cordova they've

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,449
added some extra special sauce to the

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:23,089
CLI they've added the build service

00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:24,440
there's the developer app there's

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:28,339
something called phonegap enterprise

00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,899
there's just some add-ons that Adobe

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,459
sign the kind of brand phonegap as it's

00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:33,620
on but essentially the two are

00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:35,149
interchangeable in my mind are you okay

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,850
with that is it in your mind the same

00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:40,519
thing yeah unfortunately I mentioned

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,440
earlier that I have OCD I refer to as

00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,630
Cordova causes Cordova the world kind of

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,010
calls Cordova phonegap so you'll one of

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,880
the reasons why this book isn't selling

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,380
is because people are looking for

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,569
phonegap books and they can't find this

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,569
which is why I have free copies here oh

00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:01,699
and also Adobe offers of enterprise

00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:04,280
support so if you wanna adopt phonegap

00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:05,659
cordova for your mobile apps and one of

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,919
the ways to do it with support is to buy

00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:11,890
support from Adobe alright so let's talk

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,089
about the anatomy of a Cordova app

00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,970
because this again this is something is

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,429
confusing for people i answered a post

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,689
on the google groups the other day where

00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,880
someone was asking about I've got this

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:26,240
node server app I've built how do I run

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,500
in Cordova well you can't okay the way

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,850
this works is remember I said in that

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,350
earlier picture that it's a web app

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:36,110
running inside a native container so to

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,260
do a Cordova app I build an index HTML

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,600
file I package it into a native app and

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,620
tada Cordova app is there anything

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,970
Cordova ish about this everybody say no

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:50,870
yeah no there's not it's just

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,400
HTML oh and by the way I forgot to put

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,620
this in the slides but you can build a

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,169
Cordova app that simply launches a

00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,090
remote web page in the container there's

00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:01,909
a configured XML setting of the launch

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,230
URL I just put the Earl there and it'll

00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:05,980
pull down a remote web site in the

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:11,570
container apple doesn't like that either

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,650
they don't like much they used to not

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,659
approve it I don't know if I still

00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,860
approve it I worked with a bank Carlos

00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,960
is nodding his head so I guess they will

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,220
but I worked with KeyBanc many years ago

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,620
that's what they did they build a native

00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:25,130
app that launched their website and it

00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:27,980
got killed so all right so this is hello

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:31,789
world to all this code is up on github

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:35,539
if you're interested github / John

00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:38,659
worker so this is a simple whole world

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:41,450
to basically I've added well actually

00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:46,640
not I've got animated effects what am i

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:50,720
doing tada so you add a script tag that

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,549
launches cordova at jas and then you add

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,780
an onload event we don't have to do

00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:57,020
onload there's other ways to do this but

00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:00,350
basically you want an event to fire and

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,720
so what I do is I create a and if i add

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,460
an event listener for device ready and

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,230
basically when the device ready event

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,539
has fired the crude / container has

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,600
finished initializing and the cordova

00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:13,159
capabilities are available to the app

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,210
all right so you can add the cordova

00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:15,919
api's and you can run them through

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,909
javascript code but if device ready is

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,970
not fired none of it works and the

00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:26,690
cordova app javascript errors it fails

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:27,980
silently so you'll yeah you'll you'll

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,750
put all this code in you'll forget to

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,090
add the plug-in for the for the code and

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,799
it'll run and nothing will happen yeah I

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:41,630
love that failed silently thing just

00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:45,289
love it all right and then hello world

00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:48,440
three so this is a different version the

00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:51,169
app I've added this this paragraph

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,929
calling an F input app info and then in

00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:55,880
that on body load event I have access to

00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:58,640
the device API so I've added the device

00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,470
plug into the to the app and I have I

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,890
can poll device at cordova device that

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,720
platform

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,120
device that model and device dot version

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,360
those are examples of some of the API is

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:12,530
exposed okay so as long as I run this

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:14,330
code after device ready is fired I will

00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,570
be replacing the content in that

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:22,220
paragraph tag with this do you believe

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:23,870
me okay let me show you anyways so there

00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,380
it is this is a really old screenshot

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:31,520
that's blackberry 10 and then here it is

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,530
on their platforms okay so that's just a

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,630
super simple example of how you do this

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:40,280
is there anything fancy no it's just

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:43,970
JavaScript api's all right so let's talk

00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:47,210
about these ap is so originally when

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:49,460
they did this originally when they did

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,020
this um they were custom API so the

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,110
camera API on Android was different than

00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,750
the camera AP on iOS great and over time

00:20:54,110 --> 00:21:00,140
they've they've standardized it they're

00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:06,080
trying they used to try to standardize

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:09,380
on the device device API w3c gap device

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,000
API proto anyways they were trying to

00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,350
standardize around what the w3c was

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,930
doing in the meantime they've kind of

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:17,510
abandoned that but they have undergo

00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:19,910
device api's working group but now

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,440
they're supporting the neighbor api's

00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,180
that seemed to make sense and then they

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,440
deprecated them when the capabilities

00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:30,040
become available in the browser and

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,200
pretty much all of them are plugins now

00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:36,230
there's a documentation it shows you all

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,040
the api's and so we're just giving

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,050
example to use something more

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,840
sophisticated in android if I wanted to

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,430
oh no sorry here we go so this is the

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,800
process to create an eight to create an

00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,050
app I open a terminal window or I do it

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,700
through some sort of IDE i create my

00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:51,830
projects and then i add a plug-in for

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,890
the particular capability so here I'm

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,820
adding the camera plug in this

00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,730
identifier org that I patching at

00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:01,610
cordova camera is changing or maybe has

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,920
changed they move to NPM for everything

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:07,270
and the the plug-in names are changing

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,770
and then basically I make a single call

00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,390
navigator camera died get picture and I

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:14,269
pass it some callback functions and so

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,159
on and that's basically how I invoke the

00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:18,739
camera and then what happens on the

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,959
native device varies based upon the

00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:23,119
native device in general the camera app

00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:25,729
opens you take a picture and you approve

00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:28,399
the picture and so on there's a camera

00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:31,639
options object its adjacent object it's

00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:34,489
jason not JSON Jason's just a word Jason

00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:35,809
it's adjacent object that you populate

00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:38,389
with different values that you can

00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:43,580
control that camera function when it's

00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:46,279
taken ok you don't want there's a camera

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:49,159
destination of a raw file format for the

00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:51,879
image don't ever use that because the

00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,909
JavaScript engine can't handle the the

00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:59,179
capacity of that image file as raw data

00:22:54,909 --> 00:23:01,459
so and then basically it here's an app

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:04,009
that takes a picture it brings out the

00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:07,219
camera app you take it and then you

00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:09,289
either retake or pick it and then in

00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,419
this case i pass back a file Earl to the

00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:16,549
to the app and then I can do whatever I

00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:18,709
want with it makes sense ok so to

00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:20,299
install it basically you need one or

00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:22,309
more mobile development environments on

00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:23,599
your workstation unless you're going to

00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,849
use phonegap built in which case you

00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:29,479
just need whatever you need to make the

00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:31,309
certificates it used to require get I

00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:33,529
don't think it requires requires get as

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:36,499
much but who doesn't need get other

00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:39,229
machines you install nodejs and then you

00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:41,419
run npm install cordova or you run npm

00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:45,709
install phonegap and a few minutes later

00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:46,940
you're done and then basically here

00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,909
tonight creating a project it's kind of

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,609
hard to see but basically I did Cordova

00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:53,989
create lunch menu and I pass it a couple

00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:55,820
different parameters so it created the

00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:57,499
project and what it does is it creates a

00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,359
project folder and then I seed you to

00:23:57,499 --> 00:24:01,159
that project folder and then I add

00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,489
platforms so in this case i've added

00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:07,789
Android and Windows I think so I do

00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:10,429
Cordova platform add Android space iOS

00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:12,679
face windows and it'll create a separate

00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:13,820
folder for each of those targets and

00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:15,829
then populate with the appropriate

00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,869
project information I'll show you this

00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,639
in a minute and then I add plugins so

00:24:17,869 --> 00:24:21,019
here I'm adding the device plug in which

00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:24,559
gives me access to that device API

00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:27,260
Cordova plug-in add and then I added the

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,020
dialogues which is dialogue

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,340
and then the console which really isn't

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,160
needed from any platforms because the

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,530
consoles building natively and that's it

00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:40,040
and when i get done basically what i

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:42,170
have is this project folder here so

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,610
there's a config xml file that has

00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:48,020
specific information about the project

00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:50,780
and then the www folder has basically an

00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:53,570
html5 application project there's an

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:56,060
index 2.html up a folder for javascript

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,200
CSS and so on what traditionally what

00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,430
you do is you whack this stuff and

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,120
replace it with your own thing or you

00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:07,640
just open this up and go so if i go here

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,040
here's my config xml it's based upon the

00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,530
widget specification and the crowd over

00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,640
team has been fighting for years about

00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,410
diverging from that but they're trying

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,830
to stick with as much as possible so you

00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:22,790
define here's where you define trying to

00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,960
do as my glasses there's a I can't find

00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:26,360
it there's a way where you specify this

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,430
start here source equals index 2.html if

00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,530
you replace this with an external Earl

00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,670
then when the app launches it'll go out

00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,970
to the web and pull that page in a

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:37,190
rendering and there's stuff around how

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,510
to manage intense how to handle

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,830
whitelisting all that stuff is I'm not

00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,930
gonna go in there we got go in four

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,640
hours the HTML is just that this is a

00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:47,380
boiler paid app that they include but

00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:54,980
it's a standard it's just standard stuff

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:56,900
oops all right so all right so if you go

00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,090
out in the wild and look around of the

00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,170
phonegap website has a database of a

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,960
bunch of different apps out there that

00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,250
have been built with it ultimately

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,530
because of the robustness of the

00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:09,440
JavaScript engine and the robustness of

00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,730
the third-party HTML frameworks my

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,990
personal opinion is you kind of can't

00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:17,690
tell it whether it's a native app or a

00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:19,160
web app okay you can probably tell but

00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,650
at the end of the day who cares right

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,020
can I can engage with my end user the

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,210
way I want to in a way that makes them

00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,620
interested in still using my app yeah

00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,620
okay so it works

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:38,429
uh who trying to figure my time I

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:40,919
finished up early there anything else I

00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:42,059
want to say yeah look good there all

00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,090
right so there's a bunch of resources

00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:46,710
available to you the you can access it's

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,750
actually Cordova de io is a quick way to

00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,190
get there it's the Cordova website that

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,840
the reason why I wrote that first blue

00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,160
book was because I taught myself Cordova

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,030
and I realized that the documentation

00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:59,160
was horrible and it's gotten much much

00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,110
better it's really a lot more robust

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,799
than it was so I wouldn't worry about

00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:08,010
the docs it's all pretty much there that

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,650
there used to be a Cordova support was

00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:13,230
done at google groups and what's

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,700
interesting was there was a Cordova

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,380
support area and there was a phonegap

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,270
bill or as a phonegap support area and

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,559
phonegap build support area and people

00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,390
kind of blurred the lines and it got

00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:22,590
really ugly but about a year and a half

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,630
ago two years ago they just pointed

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,400
people at stack overflow so stack

00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,900
overflow has i'm at categorization of

00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,059
Cordova in phonegap so they all kind of

00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,370
group together you'll find me there when

00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:35,940
I'm bored or drunk and I got nothing

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:37,320
else to do the devilís is really

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,700
interesting that's where Carlos hangs

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,240
out I used to hang out there but now I

00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,020
got a job that consumes all of my time

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,840
that's where the development team

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,900
discusses everything is Cordova do not

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:53,280
hop on there and ask questions about how

00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,929
to code Cordova you two things are going

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,580
to happen either you'll get ignored or

00:27:54,929 --> 00:28:02,190
you'll get flamed one of the two and you

00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,120
never know depends on who's on well one

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,500
of the things I was going to say what's

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,669
interesting was i used to have a slide

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,770
in here that called cordova the

00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:09,570
fastest-moving open source project on

00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,789
the planet because they were on a

00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,260
monthly cadence they were doing a

00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:15,289
monthly release as a Cordova it was

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,570
really pretty amazing so they would do

00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:21,620
version 3 and then a month later 3.1 3.2

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:23,880
it was really pretty amazing but they

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,280
discovered that they had were not really

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,190
following the apache way and so they've

00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,190
they've slowed down dramatically Carlos

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:37,700
is laughing that's an understatement but

00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:41,580
they so it used to be that Cordova was a

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,650
unified package of stuff so when I

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,760
downloaded Cordova and it's been

00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,020
since version 3 that you could really

00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,000
download a version if I downloaded

00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,370
version and extracted it in a folder I

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,960
had everything so I had the container I

00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,030
had the library's I had the tools at

00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,130
everything well when they went to the

00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:58,410
CLI and everything became modules and

00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,820
what's interesting is the first the

00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,020
modules weren't get and then they moved

00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,670
here and then they moved here and so

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,530
they've been a lot of changes in the way

00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:08,100
they do things but ultimately they've

00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:13,340
disconnected all of the parts so the CLI

00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:16,350
is released on its own schedule the core

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,090
platform specific stuff so Android iOS

00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:21,450
and so on is that its own release

00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:24,120
strategy and then the plugins are on

00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,040
them so it's dynamic as heck and the

00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,780
coolest thing was just weeks after

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,650
releasing Cordova for programming the

00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:33,960
book behind me they released version 5

00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:37,110
weeks but what's interesting was they

00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,940
released version 5 of the CLI the core

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,730
code for Android for example is still at

00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,590
four so anyways so there's this whole

00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,030
issue around how do I know what version

00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,430
I have and there's things are doing to

00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,110
manage dependencies and so on so I would

00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:51,450
I wouldn't lose a lot of sleep over it

00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,250
at the end of the day it's HTML running

00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:59,480
a native container and you just deal

00:29:53,250 --> 00:30:03,090
with your plugins if you find a problem

00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:05,400
submitted as a ticket in JIRA okay so if

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:06,870
you if you find a bug then just don't

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,730
don't complain about it and don't wait

00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,430
for them to fix it tell them about it

00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,080
and then then again then as soon as you

00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:15,000
tell them about it then download the

00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,510
code fix it submit the change and then

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,100
we'll all be good well I used to work

00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,780
with this team that we we created a set

00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,610
of plugins for Cordova and we would

00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,290
constantly run up against issues that we

00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,460
that weren't fixed we found boggs and

00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,750
then the developer just sit back and

00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:33,270
fold his arms no no fixit fixit

00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,440
two-minute that's the world we live in I

00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,610
don't you can see this or not but

00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,230
they're excellent Cordova books

00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,530
available John mortgage on where go bucs

00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,530
calm

00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:48,360
all right one of the cool one of the

00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:53,100
coolest experiences for me has been

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:56,120
phonegap day so the Cordova the the core

00:30:53,100 --> 00:31:00,570
Cordova guys are from Vancouver and

00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,160
apparently they really like beer am I

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,110
right Carlos Carlos is not a set yeah

00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,050
they really like beer so if you attend

00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,730
phonegap day everyone rushes through the

00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,790
morning presentation so they can start

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,830
serving beer earlier and so the beer

00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,150
comes out of 11 30 or so but anyways so

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,950
it's a phonegap day is a one-day

00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,780
conference a lot of the Cordova

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,310
committers are there a lot of the

00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,660
corporate sponsors are there as well and

00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:24,390
there's just basically a day-long

00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:26,670
presentation of different cool things

00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,750
people do in Cordova so last year last

00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,730
couple years has been in San Francisco

00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,680
they've done one in Europe as well this

00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:34,080
year I saw they didn't have one this

00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,260
year this year's event is next year it's

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,050
in Utah so apparently one's going skiing

00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:43,830
what's interesting is when I went was it

00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:46,110
wasn't last year's two years ago I it

00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,930
was the drunkest presenter I've ever

00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:51,300
seen in my entire life if you go to John

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:53,310
Walker calm and search for drunk

00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,460
phonegap Day presenter you'll you can

00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:58,830
see the you watch the presentation but i

00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,780
have never ever seen a less professional

00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:03,630
presentation done in a conference so its

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,760
roots worth watching the other thing

00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,500
there's a woman by name of liza danger

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,110
gardener she's one of the authors of the

00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,990
mobile first book on html5 and she did a

00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:14,550
presentation on how to craft a Cordova

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,260
app that spot on beautiful it's

00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,580
absolutely wonderful it's super fast

00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,860
you're gonna have to watch it twice to

00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,440
figure it out but she just talks about

00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,210
her mental progression that she went

00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,430
through when she decided to take a nap

00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,310
and put it in Cordova is really was

00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:34,350
fascinating Liza danger yes her middle

00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:36,870
name is danger Gardner and then I just

00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,280
added this today all this fun about my

00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,840
books and stuff is just it's just an

00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,910
interesting sidebar you can tell i'm

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,900
passionate about cordova the reason why

00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,270
i put this in here is because my

00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,620
publisher took the chapter 2 for my

00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:49,020
latest book and it's available free

00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,270
online so if you want to see the hello

00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,890
world 1234 that i did here but broken

00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:55,910
out and explain better its there's a

00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,910
free pdf you can download

00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:05,490
and my publisher has set up a discount

00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:07,170
code so if you go to for mighty calm /

00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:10,440
open source you can get thirty-seven

00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:12,630
percent off using that code outsource 37

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,610
so I'm sorry almost forty percent off on

00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,680
a book actually forty percent off on

00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:19,650
multiple books is worth at least

00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,210
spending an hour with me right I would

00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:23,100
pretend that this code is only good for

00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:31,890
this week but I think it's good for the

00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:35,000
rest of the year so all right and that's

00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:35,000
