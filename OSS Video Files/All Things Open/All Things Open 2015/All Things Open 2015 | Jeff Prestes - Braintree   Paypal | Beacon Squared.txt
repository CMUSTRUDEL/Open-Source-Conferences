so thanks for coming I'm Jeff prestas

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:19,189
developer advocate for braintree and

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:23,789
paypal interested because the o the last

00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:27,449
presenter was soccer referee looks like

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:31,410
he had a song you lock it a soccer right

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:34,079
oh that's great because I'm Brazilian so

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,660
let's do it we need to we need to talk

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,090
about selfie whether I don't stand here

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,059
in the States why people say football

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,340
but they don't use it feed it something

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:49,770
that I really don't understand so far

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:52,440
however no worries uh that's but ok I'm

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:58,800
Brazilian so there we use used to play

00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:03,390
soccer a lot and and I'm also we viewed

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,180
some good no mobile applications and I'm

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,460
very interested about beacons and I've

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,450
been researching about beacons for two

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,850
years so that's that's the reason of my

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,530
talk here because I got very excited

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:23,009
about edge stone and also about physical

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:27,930
lack and this is their two topics that

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:33,210
we're going to talk today there and so

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:38,520
the idea is I did this new specification

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:42,990
I can give an URL to all objects that's

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:46,320
the main idea of the you know the ad

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:50,399
stone and a physical appt and that's

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,149
really excite me so first of all what is

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,060
it so what is add stone I don't know for

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:01,170
camera zoom in here and here ok so what

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:06,119
is add stomp Eddystone is a google

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:09,569
specification for beacons data period as

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,190
in the past we had apples ibeacon and

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:17,050
specification later

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:19,420
uh some guys I'm not quite certain but

00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,870
if they are all from google or not but

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:25,540
they created you are beacons but later

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,620
they work the improve the specification

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:33,630
and rename the project for ads Thom so

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,890
but what is good for us it's open

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,110
because in general Apple Jenner

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,410
sometimes creates very good stuff but

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,810
they it's they are preparatory right so

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,750
what it gets the good stuff about edge

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:51,790
stone the beginning it's open if you

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:54,130
could go to the github website and read

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,130
the specification you know create your

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,110
own implementation and no royalties you

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:05,340
don't need to pay into any words to

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:08,740
anybody okay so and what it was compose

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:12,940
headstone it has the headstone

00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:17,980
specification has three items still trm

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:22,060
for telemetry you basically could you

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:25,930
check okay it's my become working okay I

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:29,230
because and in those following this

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,739
specification your beacon device times 2

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:35,500
times keep sending information oh I

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:39,400
broadcast the information 200 times

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:42,850
since I was activated for instance is

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:47,350
one information that you can send using

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:51,430
the telemetry the telemetric format also

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:54,940
you can use the UID this debate most

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:59,110
basic big construction ality is there

00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:04,180
the device ID that's way ok I'm getting

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:06,940
close to the beacon with IDs 11 for

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,480
instance of course the format is some

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,790
little bar as is more elaborate but it's

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,040
basically what is it so all I mean when

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,230
I'm close I'm close to this divide this

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,700
become device or that another one beaker

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:24,669
device so if you're just interested in

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,570
about proximity if your clothes are not

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:30,400
close to

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:34,810
some to some bacon device headstone eid

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,480
feet fits a service your problem but

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,570
what more is the most interesting and

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:46,980
for me let's make the ad stone much

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:54,970
different of I become as the URL so

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:58,870
using the headstone URL okay using your

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:03,850
headstone URL you could broadcast you

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:08,140
could assign an URL for advice item or

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:11,470
anything okay so the reason you should

00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:14,260
use it is because first is open source

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,820
it's an open specification you can

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:21,880
create your own and it's unlimited

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,030
because you can you know as you're out

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,360
stands for you know in five the resource

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,610
vocation it's universal and also is

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,930
unlimited you can create it in as much

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:40,420
as you value you want and you can give a

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:43,450
URL for every device for anything so

00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,750
that's the reason I I recommended you

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,480
should use it and the Eddystone URL is

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,880
try to try to look for it and try to

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,650
still it study that's the why we are

00:05:51,880 --> 00:06:00,460
here for this presentation and this is

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:04,000
the headstone URL a specification so

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:09,160
first and you have here's a byte offset

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:14,020
oh I forget a very important disclaimer

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:18,370
I'm not electron electric or electronic

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:20,530
engineer so I'm the mobile developer so

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,140
there are some details electronic

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:26,350
details if I miss please apologize me

00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:29,640
and I ask for support for Alette for any

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:32,740
electronic or electrical engineers okay

00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,550
because for instance here and attacks

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,330
and then TX power is something that is

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,250
very tricky

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:45,289
that everybody complains about beacons

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:48,979
Jeff I want to know if I'm very close to

00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:51,219
some bigger device or not I want to I

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:54,919
want to use beacons to track people

00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:59,210
among the room among my office you know

00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:02,870
my store that's the physical problem

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:06,110
okay you must remember beacon as a radio

00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,800
is emitting radio cynos so we have it

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:13,159
interfere and a lot of interferences so

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,080
that's the problem so this is going to

00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:18,680
be a problem if you want very exact

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:23,030
exactly information so how close you are

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,789
for something bigger maybe maybe not the

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,360
best device for it but if you want

00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:31,669
enough to know okay the beacon is

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,819
telling me that is burning Cassidy diet

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:37,969
that his data with this amount of

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:41,659
decibels and i'm receiving here my

00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:47,500
device in this decibels ok you could

00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:51,620
infer how close oh how far you are your

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:55,580
customers device is far or close to the

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:58,639
beacon device but guys please I ask you

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,370
don't trust a whole percent on this you

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,469
have some limitations here physical

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:08,509
limitations but here in an ad stone URL

00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:11,180
specification in this beat you define

00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:15,949
okay I'm in meeting the the big house I

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:21,379
know and this video with this power so

00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:26,060
for instance i have here nice to mode

00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:30,110
beacon and of course the most if i

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:33,560
increase the power my battery goes you

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:38,750
know the last minute last minutes or if

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:43,789
I decrease the the power the the battery

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:45,769
lesson you know let's more so ah so

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:49,250
laughter this is this is more important

00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:51,949
you have a day URLs you are a schema to

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,670
save you know some bites you have some

00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:56,300
table

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,760
schemas that you can for instance there

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:04,160
is a code for HTTPS there is a code for

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:07,970
HTTP and others and others schemas and

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:13,630
now in here you have the encoded URL it

00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:18,110
supports that's the limitation only 17

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:23,330
length so you need to use I encoded URL

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:27,740
okay but with a beach IL I and others

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:30,820
you know and other others the code that

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:35,300
your URLs you can you know easily have a

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:38,450
lot of URLs available for you in more

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:45,530
details you can get here on the github

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:47,840
of a project so the guys the Creator

00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,750
they say they saw old kid there are

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:55,490
there is a lot of petition petition on

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:58,580
this I can you know for commerce for you

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:02,750
know to give the product information to

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:07,640
you know I its endless situations for

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,800
instance I can I can give for process I

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,360
can that they our them or use the case

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:17,290
for demo is you go to a theater and you

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,420
have several different movies you know

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:23,660
and that instead of for instance you

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:26,120
look for a paper you know and to see the

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:29,780
details about movie why not when you get

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,860
close or do you get inside of the the

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:36,110
theater you open your open application

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,410
we have the physical web application by

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:43,250
the way it's a open source application

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:45,830
it's for free you can you customer could

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,470
download for app store or from Play

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:52,310
Store for free you can download the code

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,820
and change the source for your needs ok

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:58,790
so when it open see the list of the

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,530
movies available in a theater and the

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,920
customer could okay let me see the

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,440
synopsis let me see all I if you want to

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,920
see the trailer

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,750
and you don't need to give feed piper or

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:14,290
you don't need to give it have some

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,930
employee gives them some information the

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:21,190
cosmic could see yourself several people

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:26,070
come to me say Jeff does physical appt

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:30,730
is the kind of is evolution of care code

00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:32,730
for some stuff might be you know your

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,450
broadcast information about your product

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:39,520
but you don't need to go to close and

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:42,040
shut a picture you know that was the

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,190
problem of maybe the camera you know

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,680
could be is not so good you keep up

00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,990
people keep trying you know to set a

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,300
picture of the cure code with physical

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:59,950
appt it'll have this problem anymore and

00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:03,460
the good part of physical AB is a

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:06,310
headstone is based on edge stone

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:10,510
specification and as edge stone

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:12,730
specification it's open we have we have

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:18,490
several implementation different

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:21,100
languages for instance I of besides you

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,110
know like headstone beacons or any other

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,540
because that we have available in the

00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:29,470
market instead of besides of those

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:33,640
devices I can take a linux machine or a

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:38,310
Mac machine or a windows machine and the

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:43,900
machine could broadcast I had stone URL

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:46,360
so i can create atoms you know with and

00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,520
i can create ottens with more

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,480
sophisticated information or something

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:55,000
like that that it could it could

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,380
broadcast the URL it could broadcast

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,450
information using add stone so i'm going

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,600
to show you here for instance i have

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:07,510
here implementation node but there are

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,910
some presentations in java and the

00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:13,510
python

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,770
a node I know I don't know if have a/c

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:19,780
shop so far but I've seen some guys

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:24,940
trying to create an implementation but

00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:26,740
so I but one thing is for I have a what

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:30,550
happens in sure that works in the

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:33,550
Raspberry Pi I have one West Bay pie and

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:37,750
I stole the package over there and I run

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:41,140
by I start to broadcast you know an URL

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:45,220
using i just bought a small bluetooth

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:47,970
USB dongle that follows four dot zero

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:53,680
bluetooth specification and then I

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:56,470
started to broadcast an URL so this is

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,470
the wii and they're also week inc with

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,060
unlimited use of cases these are some

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,810
using cases the people are starting to

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:09,790
work with and one one thing that I I do

00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:12,220
here for this is a paypal dummy if you

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:15,910
go to paypal dummy if you have a paypal

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:18,070
account you can create your own URL for

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,850
instance I have my own RL paypal da meat

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:24,910
/ jet prestes anyone can go there and

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,190
then if you liked my presentation if you

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:30,100
maybe you cannot give my five stars of

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:35,290
review but it can give my dollar I don't

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:38,920
know whether I prefer but ok so and that

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:44,350
here in this device here I'm in birthing

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:48,760
Cassidy's URL so of course you can

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:51,850
create our webpage so and also using our

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:56,020
dropping component that is for mobile

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,330
web pages you can use dropping and the

00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,940
customer came by for instance I now will

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,700
use case our demo the customer by the

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,660
ticket of his the movie though he wants

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:10,960
to watch and the mobile device because I

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,060
broadcast a web page the access the web

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,880
page in them you know mobile application

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:20,560
and sorry in a mobile the mobile browser

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,300
and I can make others actions over there

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,649
and what is good because a lot of people

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,119
come to me say

00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:31,420
Jeff is become safe okay if you

00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:33,430
broadcast on URL there is the

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,259
information where is that transaction

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:39,220
happens whatever things happens in your

00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:42,309
server and your web web servers so I

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:46,119
hope in your web service is behind a

00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:50,529
fire oh and the replication is it's well

00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:54,339
was very well coated safe coded so it's

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:57,449
a barrier for threads so no harm you're

00:15:54,339 --> 00:16:02,589
just were to cast in URL nothing else

00:15:57,449 --> 00:16:05,439
okay so this is this bring security for

00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:09,220
for your application you don't need to

00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:12,189
rely on beacon because it's opening so

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:15,029
anybody could can they're very well but

00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:18,009
to make some operation make something

00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:21,939
the customer is doing the the

00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:27,449
transaction on your web server it's

00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:30,189
secured so also with this with a

00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:35,230
headstone you can bring you know

00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:38,949
security for your beacons operations ok

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:43,990
here is going to start our demo but

00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:48,999

broadcast do remember that my to

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:13,530
remember my idea of a movie theater I'm

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:21,000
going to show you how to broadcast on

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:23,240
URL using node let me see okay let me

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,240
okay

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:44,650
okay Chris the oops

it's always tripping amerigas

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:16,910
okay are you guys able to read okay so I

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:26,680
just before to show the code you just

00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:40,780
ran the road that's not Jes ok so if

00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:47,360
everything runs ok oops 222 ok Lambie ok

00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:49,010
ok so you see I don't know maybe the

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,860
guys in the back you're not able to

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,990
capture the this I know but I'm sure the

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:57,260
guys here in front are able to capture

00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:01,670
in there your devices because i'm using

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:03,740
what I'm use my Mac I'm use the

00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:07,370
bluetooth of my mac to broadcast this

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:10,640
your real ow I know it's also in a linux

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:16,160
is it for knew that if you have a

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,350
computer with bluetooth for dot 0 that

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,140
supports 40 specification are you able

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:25,420
to do this in linux and also a no meters

00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:28,790
10 if you are able to do the same so

00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,950
what's the idea imagine if your i came

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,170
to the theater for instance i said is

00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:36,170
nice you're talking about some guys i

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:39,170
will be more older than I and they say

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:43,370
okay I want to see Benny over there and

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:46,250
when I open here and I push you see just

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:51,980
go to our web app up to a sorry to our

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:54,290
web page and the Wi-Fi downs if a wife I

00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:58,580
don't doesn't kill me it's going to up

00:22:54,290 --> 00:23:00,800
the web page here ok so but the day is

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,260
ok you're broadcasting yo you your

00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:09,110
customer your visitor whatever goes to

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:11,840
the URL and access the content ok quite

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:17,150
easy huh that's one something that I

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:19,400
love and this it's simple easy but in

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,690
your canes callate you know with

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,070
Angela's possibility

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:26,720
you see he okay now we have the page and

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:30,530
you have hit the synopsis blah blah blah

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,830
nikka too and here for instance I can I

00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:36,880
have a checkout page using the brain

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:39,800
trained up dropping I can come here

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:47,170
because we could put a credit card data

00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:50,900
and say okay confirm the payment and

00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:55,280
after the so everything is happening

00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:57,410
what in my server so it secures not

00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:02,270
happening on the customer device is

00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:05,000
happening on the server okay and so I

00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,680
don't I can make a / and you know money

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,980
transactions I can make some more

00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:13,340
complex stuff and I don't have to be you

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,290
have to be to have a fear of the

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:18,770
customer device was installing or

00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:20,870
someone broadcast the same URL okay it's

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:29,260
going to broadcast in this case a movie

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:32,090
and no harm there's no risks ok and ok

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,220
why it's working i'm sorry about my

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:39,020
internet connection my phone something

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:44,090
is happening so but and how in what is

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:52,430
the code i mean let me see if see if i'm

00:24:44,090 --> 00:25:06,160
able to oh ok wow ok my connection drop

00:24:52,430 --> 00:25:15,050
it I'm sorry let's do PCD ok node

00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:20,570
headstone URL ok and if I my VI works

00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:28,190
correctly I remember to city code and

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:29,670
not that good ok let's go to sublime ok

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:38,000
Oh perfect

00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:38,000
let me just suggest the size of a frog

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:54,380
are much better I'm trying to be a Coty

00:25:49,370 --> 00:26:00,520
hero in front of you but I have here the

00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:05,390
Oh much better okay so what what is it

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:09,200
you have you hear it they have a module

00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:12,950
called ed stone beacon it's available on

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,460
NPM you just go there npm install edge

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,160
stone beacon and in your application see

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:22,400
is quite easy just you quite a model

00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,820
create an object here you put some

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,980
options and the power level that I told

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:31,310
you that you want to broadcast that you

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:34,370
want to use the tiller mail count ok so

00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:37,340
I broadcast two times the real well

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:42,230
later I over to catch someone tell em

00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:45,530
information and two frames are ever 10

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:50,780
of I'm sorry for 10 advisement so okay I

00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:53,650
send ten times the URL later eyes count

00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:57,410
two and then I said oh and tell em

00:26:53,650 --> 00:27:00,260
information for telemetry and here i

00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:08,420
define which real well I'm going to

00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:10,730
advertise and then nothing more so if I

00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,370
don't out Jeff I want to only use the

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:16,640
standards for me there's no problem okay

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,590
just with three lines of code you can

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,780
broadcast you can broadcast information

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:25,820
on your beacon you could create your

00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:29,360
beacon okay Oh GFI so i can use my my

00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:33,320
raspberry pi yes you can i can use for

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,550
instance i can for if I want created for

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,590
instance I can use Raspberry Pi to

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:40,760
create a taught them you know input in a

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:43,130
mall for enough for him maybe forgive it

00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:47,060
firm a sh about my project my product

00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:50,690
yes you can you know so you can create a

00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:55,520
lot of stuff but now you can ask me okay

00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:58,660
Jeff I i have this I have how to

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:03,530
broadcast but I want to

00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:07,550
how can i detect how can i how can i

00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:11,960
receive the information okay is any

00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:16,010
android developer here right hand okay

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:19,160
is everybody is more iOS developer or

00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:23,210
web developer right ok because but i

00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:26,120
assure you the codeine and java code for

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:28,510
android but i tell you the how the

00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:33,410
logics because it works the same way on

00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:37,130
on on projective see the thing is when

00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,840
you start you need to adhere so a page

00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:42,020
that show you start the bluetooth

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,679
manager for android okay you get the

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:48,559
resource for from android later you

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,740
start you in the Benin and Android you

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,140
start a service because in android the

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,809
the physical I pin your droid device it

00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:01,250
to Brazil and then back and in the back

00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:04,520
and so it doesn't if the customer close

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:09,800
the app it we close the app but it keeps

00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:13,790
running on background okay and after

00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:18,230
this you start this the p wo wo

00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:22,040
discovery services and you start to low

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:24,020
energy scan so you ask for for you

00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,940
android device k pleases care for me

00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:30,740
each the know using Bluetooth Low Energy

00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:34,940
you know specifications can the device

00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:38,150
that is nearby and after start you

00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:42,040
noticed this and you start to receiving

00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:46,190
a call back call that here on el

00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:50,240
low-energy scam you start to receive you

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:52,070
know the device is your mobile your

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,040
mobile phone there'll be co device in

00:29:52,070 --> 00:30:00,490
mobile phone you know the Tecton and a

00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:03,440
region okay and here as I told you the

00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:09,200
headstone you know this library is open

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:11,779
or your I beacon library the library so

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,710
when you start your parse the data

00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:18,679
and here what do you what do you do you

00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:21,469
check if that the you check the you know

00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:24,769
they remember the specification of Eddie

00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:28,210
stony aroused in the data here was a

00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:34,129
method that they called the URL for you

00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:37,099
ok here get the schema so it's very

00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:38,869
detailed I'm i think i said don't have

00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:40,690
here a lot of android developers that

00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:42,559
don't need to go into the taste but just

00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:47,029
implementation of course if you go to

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:49,999
the github you are able to find they are

00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:55,429
the objectives implementation but the

00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:59,419
logic is the same ok so you see here the

00:30:55,429 --> 00:31:03,559
network oops here the table that show

00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:06,139
you the uri schemes and also for the

00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,659
codes this is for save you have only a

00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:12,379
few bites available so what the guys did

00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:18,080
ok let's create some bites that ok if

00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:21,710
the bite is to is HTTP if the bite is 0

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,919
https double double W dot so it saves

00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:27,440
you know it's for saving for saving

00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:34,219
bites and when you're broadcasting data

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:37,269
and ok so that'd be sad you have here

00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:39,349
and of course you can get this code and

00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:41,539
customize and create your own

00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:43,489
application because you can say okay

00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:45,919
Jeff but I want to offer something more

00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:48,979
than the standard physical web

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:53,589
application okay go there take the code

00:31:48,979 --> 00:31:58,549
and adapt it for your needs okay so

00:31:53,589 --> 00:32:03,499
that's so that's them I really excited

00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:05,839
so you can use the again you know Keir

00:32:03,499 --> 00:32:09,919
codes anymore you don't need any more

00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:13,219
care codes with that you can start to

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,639
have a remote you know remote sales you

00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:20,089
can create for instance you can put you

00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:21,830
know left some items or something some

00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:24,290
products and maybe on a shopping mall

00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:27,560
and people can go there get in

00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:30,950
permission if they what they came by you

00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,480
know alone so you don't need to have an

00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,060
employee there give information about

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,830
the project this is something related

00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,960
because of course I work for brain

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:42,230
trader paypal we are very focused on

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,440
Commerce but if you need for other

00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:47,060
applications for other situations I feel

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,790
free to create any solution that you can

00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:52,430
it's open this is what I most like is I

00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:58,640
can you know I can create whatever I

00:32:52,430 --> 00:33:05,140
want so guys that's it it's quite simple

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,140
and i'm here for questions ok you

00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:31,710
I would out love I would love to have

00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:35,610
this I agree view I don't know why they

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:38,070
don't have this but I when I talk to

00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,650
some guys in Google and for Android that

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:46,050
I'd more have some contacts they don't

00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:50,190
have plans for Apple only God knows you

00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:52,830
know nobody knows and but I I i agree

00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,930
view it would be amazing it would it be

00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:58,500
a lot of people because you see it just

00:33:54,930 --> 00:34:01,740
a very simple app why not come as

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:16,320
standard you know I agree with you but I

00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:20,610
have no yeah i think if you just come

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,350
the cosmic could activate okay if is not

00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:24,900
a people go there and activate something

00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,150
like that i agree is not some privacy

00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:30,360
the customer decides the level of

00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:33,150
privacy he wants and a other application

00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:37,560
that I I forget to mention but for

00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:41,100
instance if you have an Android in the

00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,560
you if you have in a wearable as much

00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,020
watch and androids might watch and this

00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,480
application for Android also sends you a

00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,550
notification if you want you if you if

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,330
you'll you know gives you're signing it

00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:56,940
says it shows you here oh it showed a

00:34:54,330 --> 00:35:01,560
your router broadcast and so doing a

00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:05,370
