	00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,450
so we're going to do the show of hands

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,990
thing how many people in here are

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,839
designers I'm not going to test you on

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,920
that so don't be too scared how many in

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,210
here would consider themselves a

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,529
developer okay do we have anybody else

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,060
do we have management who would not

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,939
consider themselves either okay we got

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,990
handful of those anything else that

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,279
pretty much covers it right we got a

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,109
couple seats up here guys if you want to

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,309
come down we got some people have

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:33,870
scooted in so there's even chairs on the

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,989
edge you don't have to crawl over

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,020
awkwardly or anything so quickly about

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,329
me um I was the lead designer on

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,550
brackets which was a fun open source is

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,079
still a fun open source center here in

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,730
brackets user yeah there's always like

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:54,570
three so it's an open source editor

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,520
built in HTML CSS and JavaScript for

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,660
building web applications that's what

00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,850
it's designed for it's got some really

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,530
fun stuff in it some innovative ideas

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,719
and the team that I was able to work

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,489
with that adobe on building that the

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,010
brilliant some of the smartest people

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:13,530
I've ever worked with so that was fun I

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:17,280
was also a developer on top coat and I'm

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,990
still working on that one it's a CSS

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,270
framework because we don't have enough

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,710
of those so yeah and then right now I'm

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,080
actually the front-end lead for phonegap

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,060
which is not an open source project but

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,030
it's built on Cordova and the team is

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,700
active participants in Cordova so that

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,979
we kind of get an open-source ticket

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,079
that way we're running out of seats guys

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,170
we got a couple down here in front got a

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,880
couple back there and apparently they're

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,780
recording it so if you have to leave I

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,070
won't harm you or anything all right so

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:55,020
originally I was a designer I moved into

00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,630
coding for a few reasons mostly because

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,479
I like coding but also I realized I can

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,200
make more money which is a sad fact

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,180
developers make more money than

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,649
designers for the most part that's just

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,209
a generalization and it's sad but it's

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:11,009
oftentimes true and then also I also had

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,360
a hard time I was not a good designer I

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,530
had a hard time working with developers

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,790
sometimes because they

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,069
be like oh we can't do that and I'd be

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,810
like screw you and then I'd go and find

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,640
a way to do it right that's not

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,200
necessarily great communication or

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,760
collaboration that's not necessarily a

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,040
good designer it's a very junior

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,250
designer type of move which I did all

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,980
the time so I found myself coding more

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,630
and more and then I started with

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,250
brackets turns out I've also worked on

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,800
Adobe flex which was before where it is

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,480
now Apache flex so I've kind of worked

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,900
on open source projects for a long time

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,519
but it wasn't until topcoat and phonegap

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,790
that I actually understood what real

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,100
open source was so I was doing some

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,070
pseudo open source Adobe would do things

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,440
like they take down the code base for a

00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,730
few days before a big release because I

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,790
didn't want anyone to know what was

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,550
coming that's not really open right and

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,580
then they stopped being able to handle

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,560
bug fixes because there was too many

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,970
coming in so they're just like yeah

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,000
we're not doing that in it that's not

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,290
open so they there were some growing

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,079
pains there and it's in a lot better

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,760
place now but because of some of the

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,769
mistakes that I made I actually helped

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,680
start something called the open design

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,239
foundation and it's a small little thing

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,790
but it's just trying to help encourage

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,700
more designers to get involved in open

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,290
source it's really the end goal there's

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,400
actually some stickers out on the

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,070
sticker exchange if you want them

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,180
because yeah oh nice aren't you got went

00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:43,620
on there thank you but yeah we want to

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,620
get more designers involved in open

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,049
source and where we can we'd like to

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:52,200
help developers to understand design

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,549
better in open source so I'm going to

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,450
talk about three things real quick we're

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,329
going to talk about the big picture

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,359
stuff which is the current state of

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:01,980
opens designed an open source right now

00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:03,450
and how we need to change things and

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,670
then I want to talk about some more

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,500
specific discussions of best practices

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,750
for working with designers in your

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,269
current projects and then how we can

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,070
bridge the gap between what we have in

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:19,440
what we need in the future going forward

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,940
so how can design help open source there

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,789
are three main areas that we really

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,520
could use design help user experience is

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,230
the biggest one and somewhat because it

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,580
encompasses

00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,220
everything else you could say that

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,840
everything every time a user interacts

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,200
with your project on any level it is

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,990
considered user experience okay that's

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,760
kind of a vague blobs term then when we

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,720
use it like that but that's how some

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,130
people do use it branding I'm going

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,780
through this right now a project was

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,520
just given like a cease and desist type

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,890
of thing and they're like I'll crap

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,470
we've got to rename our project and you

00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,180
would not believe like the thought

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,650
process that's going through the project

00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,120
right now like we're just grasping at

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,470
straws sometimes we're like all right

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,600
what if we turn it upside down what does

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,120
it look like then right like it's not

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,980
necessarily like a process it's just

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,400
kind of throwing stuff and seeing what's

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,080
going to stick branding is important and

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,450
there is a process to it if you want to

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,190
do it and then obviously the visual you

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,930
I when we think about design that's

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,330
oftentimes what we come to that's what

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,490
we think of we think oh this is pretty

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,180
this is whatever the other terrible

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,280
words that we use are like sexy or like

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:33,050
it's smooth it's butter I hate all this

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,430
stuff all right so stuff that usually

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,470
just what we're looking at and that

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,710
visual you I really is the least

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,930
important out of the three it is

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,370
important to get me wrong but if I had

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,350
to pick one I'd stick with user

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:50,360
experience and as a second maybe

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:54,170
branding so some examples of projects I

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,770
just want to point out real quickly SAS

00:05:54,170 --> 00:06:00,260
is amazing it is it's fantastic right

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,180
and it's got a beautiful logo it's got

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,390
excellent documentation who in here love

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,920
sass right lots of people the community

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,350
is really inclusive they're doing a

00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,550
great job anybody in here love and sat

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:16,580
less sorry we got less people okay last

00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,860
four less part of it a little bit is I

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,300
feel like they're missing a little bit

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,700
of the design there's a little bit less

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,200
documentation and that it's kind of a

00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,640
chicken than the egg type of problem

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,360
right if you get enough people someone's

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,240
going to start writing more

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,590
documentation so the more popular

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,090
projects tend to get better

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,710
documentation but if you have better

00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,260
documentation you tend to get more

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,260
popular so it's kind of a chicken in the

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,820
egg and then anyone in here love stylist

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,000
that's my people right there all right

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,910
so it's a really lesser-known used

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,340
project right now I really really really

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,570
enjoy the syntax but it's highly

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:56,150
polarizing and it does not have an

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:58,550
amazing logo I don't know what that

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,790
thing is or what it's doing nothing

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,800
wrong with it but compared to what I

00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,560
feel like SAS is communicating I just

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,870
don't feel like it's quite as strong and

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,280
the point of this talk is not to tear

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,140
down projects i'm not trying to tear

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,970
down if the stylist designer is in here

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,700
who designed this logo i love you thank

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:21,050
you for your contribution but we're not

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:24,190
done so what is the current state of

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:28,100
design contributions and open source

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,930
right now open source design it's it's a

00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:35,720
lot less common place and they're a

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:38,690
couple reasons for that the first is I

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,360
well the first is I think we lack

00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,100
tooling around design when you're a

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
developer you have all of these really

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,220
nice tools that developers have built

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,980
for themselves to improve collaboration

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,470
right we don't have the github for

00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:54,290
design pixel apps tried using that

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,020
tagline for a while and it's probably

00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,760
closer but I'm not forking and merging

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,220
designs anytime soon like that's not

00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,760
happening unless I'm copying and pasting

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:07,190
layers from Photoshop documents so

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,110
toolings just not there but I think

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,640
that's a weak excuse because to be

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,800
honest tooling hasn't always been there

00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,060
for developers either like this is

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,630
pretty recent stuff that we're dealing

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,400
with good collaboration tools I think

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:23,690
the bigger problem and the harder one is

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,760
one that deals with culture design

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:29,090
hasn't had the people like Richard

00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,910
Stallman or Linus Torvalds who will be

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,770
pushing open source and this

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,880
collaboration I think on top of that

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:40,550
design school design schools and

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,680
managers in the workforce they encourage

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:46,190
competition designers are encouraged to

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,900
compete with each other on top of that

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,420
designers are often overworked and

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,120
underappreciated so you have a designer

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,130
who is on three projects at work and

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
to switch tracks all the time between

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,830
these projects as soon as they get home

00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,690
they're not going to be excited about

00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:02,600
contributing to a fourth project in

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,220
their free time and those things aren't

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,320
exclusive to designers but I feel like

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,150
those problems are worse with designers

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,550
than they are with developers yeah I

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,200
when I worked it in the agencies almost

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,720
all the agencies that I've been a part

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,779
of that were serious about development

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,200
they were the designers were outnumbered

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:28,520
at least like four or five to one at

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,020
least and you'd have like a small core

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,670
team of designers who are working on

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,460
everything and not really doing any of

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,690
them perfectly they're just kind of

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:39,560
trying to tread water on all the

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:41,270
projects at the same time but we do have

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,380
some designers already involved in open

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,600
source and we appreciate those

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,150
contributions that we do get what other

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,770
whatever format we can get them but it

00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,870
usually falls into one of three camps

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,400
the first one is usually the designer

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,430
that's the buddy of an open source

00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,250
project owner who is tricked or cajoled

00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:01,610
and somehow pressured peer pressure

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,650
right for a positive use hopefully but

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,180
usually they're peer pressured into

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,250
doing something that they wouldn't have

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,440
otherwise done there's the other one who

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,560
is the designer who's a corporate

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,430
sponsor usually they are a paid employee

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,900
of a company that wants to contribute to

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,890
an open source project or a company that

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:25,190
owns an open source project anybody in

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:27,230
that camp in here okay they're getting

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,400
paid to do open source work and that's

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,279
great and I don't think we should lose

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:35,720
that at all and then the third one is

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,060
the designer who happens to also be a

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,860
developer so a developer who is already

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,779
invested or interested in open source

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,279
and they realize hey this design works

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,110
not getting done someone better do it

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,490
I'm the only one who has the skill here

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,220
to do it I might as well do it until we

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:52,970
find someone better okay so those hybrid

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,529
people which is great anybody else feel

00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,540
like there's anybody outside of those

00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,779
realms is there any designer who doesn't

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,339
fall into those camps okay I think this

00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,200
is this is pretty accurate there are

00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,209
other talented designers who are making

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,920
contributions to other projects but that

00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:08,660
aren't specifically open source

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,070
and I think it might happen on

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,529
open-source once in a while but it's

00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,180
rare and they're not long-term

00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:19,300
participants they're usually swooped in

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:21,500
do something and leave again okay so

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,389
kind of switch tracks and I kind of want

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,389
this is kind of to explain why I think

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:28,910
this is that we're lacking some of these

00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:33,980
designers and it's a bit of a personal

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:35,540
story but on July first of 2014 my

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,050
daughter was diagnosed with type 1

00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:41,480
diabetes and we actually moved in part

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:44,690
to Idaho because of that but diabetes is

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,940
a auto immune disease type 2 is

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:53,089
different type 2 is caused by age and

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:55,760
oftentimes genetics and also lifestyle

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:57,170
so people will be like oh my grandma had

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,430
diabetes I'm like yeah that's it's a

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,430
little bit different actually it's

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:04,339
extremely different but that's great we

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,420
can relate on something I'm sure but

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,949
type one on the other hand it's an

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,810
autoimmune disease it can happen at any

00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:10,310
stage in life it used to be called

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,949
juvenile diabetes because it happened

00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,390
early often times but it doesn't have to

00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:16,490
their people who women who are pregnant

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,930
and then afterwards gestational diabetes

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,820
for some reason turns into type 1

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,260
diabetes and they don't know why they

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,730
don't know the cause of this disease it

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,320
just kind of happens but what it does is

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,199
it shut down to the insulin-producing

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,540
cells in your body and so once you don't

00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:32,000
produce insulin anymore your body cannot

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,279
use the sugar in your blood so my

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,130
daughter at this point in July first her

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:39,380
body was eating was consuming sugar and

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:43,339
the sugar was near the cells in the

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,500
blood but was not able to be utilized by

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:48,800
those cells so my daughter was starving

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:52,040
even though she was eating regularly and

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,240
then you run into some other issues but

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,949
so yeah we'll move on quickly but the

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,560
one of the problems is that we have the

00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:03,709
problems with insulin and blood sugar of

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,290
highs and lows your body if you don't

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:08,839
have type 1 or type 2 diabetes if you

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,060
get too much insulin and your body uses

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,560
too much of the sugar your body will

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,149
just release some more sugar that it's

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,250
been storing so it's not a big deal with

00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:18,470
my daughter for some reason her body

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,120
doesn't do that so she can go either way

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,570
she can either go too high for too long

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,060
which caught

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,100
long-term damage or she can go too low

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,550
if she gets too much insulin and she's

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,650
overdosed and eventually her body will

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,750
just kind of shut down and that one can

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,390
be very quickly can happen very quickly

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,550
and it's very dangerous but one of the

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,490
hard parts about diabetes is the lack of

00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,560
data so six times a day this was the

00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,180
week after she was diagnosed six times a

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,610
day we would have to poke her finger

00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,280
with the needle get the blood out of her

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,710
finger put it on a testing strip and see

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,170
what her blood sugar was we would do

00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:57,650
that before well when she first woke up

00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:00,320
so before breakfast before lunch before

00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,120
dinner right after dinner or close to

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,930
bedtime and then we would do it at two

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,850
in the morning right so it looked like

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,170
this this is I'm giving you a lot more

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,300
education you probably expected that

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,430
this wasn't in the description so this

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,930
is a this is the hundred this is

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:20,150
milligrams of glucose / deca leader deco

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,840
later deciliter deco leader deca liter

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:25,880
of blood so weird measurement because

00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,020
I've never seen a deciliter for blood we

00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,940
haven't we don't need that much of it

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,970
but anyway that's that's the goal line

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:35,740
is 100 anything above 160 is considered

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:38,540
high anything below 70 is considered low

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,910
so this is actually a real data from

00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,280
that that day where I was holding her in

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:45,550
that picture the problem with it is

00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,500
those were the only points that we have

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,990
and so you might expect it was doing

00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,800
something like this in between but it

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,270
could have been doing something like

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,260
this it could have been doing something

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,580
like that and this one's really

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,230
dangerous because it two in the morning

00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,180
it would have looked like she was high

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,500
and I would have ignored anything else

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,630
after that but she could actually been

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,100
coming down really quickly so just a

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,390
high number by itself doesn't show any

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,560
direction or anything like that yeah you

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:10,270
guys are smart you know this all right

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,040
so we just didn't have enough data so

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:15,260
they have invented what is called a

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,570
continuous glucose monitor it's a little

00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,250
strip that goes into your skin it

00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,410
doesn't check blood sugar it checks

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,360
sugar in the interstitial fluid in your

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,460
skin which is similar but not quite the

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,560
same and then it transmits it to a

00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,090
receiver and you can see there it's gets

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,210
a lot more data right every five minutes

00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:33,379
it's got a new data point but one of the

00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,359
downsides this is

00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:38,599
that there's a little receiver on the

00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:40,399
skin we get about 20 feet distance right

00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:44,720
I've got to keep that receiver 20 feet

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,849
away from my daughter who is 10 that's

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,319
not really useful to me when I send her

00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:49,669
off to school her school is a small

00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:52,189
school she doesn't have a nurse there

00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:55,099
who knows anything about diabetes they

00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:58,519
don't yeah they're learning a lot which

00:15:55,099 --> 00:16:00,199
is great and so it's not practical for

00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:01,369
my wife to like follow behind her 20

00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,519
feet and be like all right she's doing

00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:06,919
ok so at ahs con last year or two years

00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,089
ago yeah two years ago now somebody said

00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:12,549
hey you should check out nights count

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:14,809
and night scout is a project where a dad

00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:17,299
realized that there was a USB port on

00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:19,189
this receiver and that you can get the

00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:20,779
data it's designed to get that data off

00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:22,369
of that receiver and so the first

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,859
iteration what he did is he just had a

00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:29,209
computer a laptop that he took with his

00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:32,089
daughter to two I think it was daycare

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:33,829
and it was constantly pulling the data

00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:37,609
off of that receiver and then uploading

00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:41,419
it to the cloud it's moved on since then

00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:43,189
they now use cell phones so my daughter

00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:44,659
carries around she's the only ten year

00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:46,869
old I know whose parents are like yeah

00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:51,220
we're getting you a cell phone alright

00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:53,989
so yeah it uploads it to the cloud and

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,959
it's really nice in fact they've

00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:59,389
actually added a pebble watch app so my

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,979
wife can check or watch the only

00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:02,539
downside is people think that she like

00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,709
has somewhere to go because she checks

00:17:02,539 --> 00:17:06,379
it once in a while and they're like oh

00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:08,799
she's really impatient she's like now

00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:11,809
I'm just making sure my daughter's alive

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,789
and they've actually what was

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:15,949
interesting is dexcom who makes this

00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:19,250
receiver they have to go through all the

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,679
fda stuff with all of the health

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,539
regulations but this is an open source

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,679
project we don't have to do any of that

00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:29,629
for doing it for ourselves and so they

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,919
came out with a new version of the the

00:17:29,629 --> 00:17:32,539
transmitter or the receiver that

00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,279
actually uses bluetooth to communicate

00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:36,740
to a phone and they went through all

00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,450
this fda stuff and within a day of the

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,700
developers getting it in their hand they

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,710
mimicked the exact same behavior and

00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,320
took full advantage of the bluetooth

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,550
stuff with the android phone which decks

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,680
comes doesn't made an android

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,290
so it's really interesting like within

00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,150
just hours of getting their hands on it

00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,790
the open source community was we're able

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:58,580
to work so much faster than all the

00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,950
other stuff so oh and we also have an

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,720
Apple watch app because you got to have

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:04,220
an Apple watch app right it's actually

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,630
not as good it's one of the times where

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,240
I can say no the pebble is totally way

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:11,570
better because I have to wait like five

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,610
minutes for it to process the data yeah

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,340
right there Oh see that's not going to

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,320
work alright so but what I wanted to

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,840
show is is the power of open source with

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,680
this and more than that is what we found

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,270
with this project becoming a part of it

00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,250
this is not something I would have been

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,720
involved in at all before my daughter

00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,920
was diagnosed it wasn't something that I

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,240
would have been like that's really cool

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,750
that those people are doing that good

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,530
job right and I would have moved on

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,540
suddenly though when my daughter was

00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,700
diagnosed I have a vested interest and

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,040
you've got people who you might consider

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,370
to be soccer moms or less technical

00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:50,030
people who are forking repos on github

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:52,580
who are deploying nodejs applications on

00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:55,730
Azure and on Heroku who are utilizing

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,910
MongoDB because they have to set it up

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,460
themselves otherwise we have to get the

00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,020
FDA involved and so people are doing it

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,660
for themselves obviously there's great

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,790
documentation and they're getting a lot

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,980
of hand-holding wherever they can but

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,050
these people are interested in the

00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,100
outcome of this project and they're

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:17,450
heavily involved and it's because they

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:22,600
have a sense of community and they have

00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:26,420
this motivation we don't have that

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,430
necessarily with designers we don't

00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,670
necessarily we haven't created that

00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:35,300
atmosphere for them yet enough where we

00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:37,310
feel like they can feel like they are a

00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:41,780
part of a community to be honest open

00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:43,220
source can be highly exclusive that may

00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,750
not feel that way to you if you're a

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,970
developer involved in open source

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,530
projects but if you are ever on the

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,600
outside of open source people doing

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,970
their first pull requests on github it

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,500
feels pretty daunting and it feels like

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,630
it's a cool kids club that they're not a

00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,840
part of sometimes or maybe a really

00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,860
nerdy kids cuz I don't know

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,270
but also they need to have the

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,790
motivation they need to have a good

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,470
reason for contributing somebody at one

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,429
point with the open design foundation

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,080
we're like hey we're looking for

00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:11,090
projects that need design help and we

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,220
got this this flood of projects and some

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,230
of them were like we're checking the

00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,570
health of packets that are being sent

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,980
across and I'm like I'm sorry you're

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,720
probably never going to get design help

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,850
with that because the designers never

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,770
going to care about that I can't you

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,450
might find that one that one who was

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,220
like yeah I really care about the health

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,900
of packets a crowd I don't even know

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,950
what the project was to be honest I

00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:36,140
couldn't get through the readme so yeah

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,120
we need to we need to cut help that

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:42,350
motivation help people to help designers

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:47,360
to feel motivated what time are we going

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:49,929
in til three o'clock we're just gonna

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,340
keep going until someone makes me stop

00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:54,770
310 all right we're still we're good

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,020
okay so what do we go what do we do

00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,090
until we get those designers we're

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,190
working on that the open design

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:03,559
foundation is working actively to try

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,910
and help designers see the benefits of

00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:07,280
participating in open source and

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:10,190
recruiting and encouraging and getting

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,690
people to do those things but it's going

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,070
to be a slow process it's going to take

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,360
some time we could use your help if you

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,970
want to get involved in the open design

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,370
foundation we'd love to have you feel

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,410
free to talk to me afterwards but we

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:24,320
can't wait for them either so what do we

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,419
do until then we had a lot of developers

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,850
in here right okay I am officially

00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:31,880
deputizing you as designers you are now

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,710
officially junior designers because code

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,179
is hard why don't you just drop pictures

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:39,470
all day that's way easier to do and

00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:41,809
there are some real benefits if you are

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,059
the junior designer you get to use

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,560
helvetica and feel condescending about

00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:48,060
it right

00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,920
you get to use words like kerning you

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,990
get to say ah that kerning seems off

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,310
there you don't have to know what it

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,440
means that's totally cool there are a

00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:59,130
lot of people talk about kerning they

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,260
have no idea what it means and you are

00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,840
allowed to go on to dribble and get

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,880
inspired by other people's design work

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,710
and take it wholesale and do whatever

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,280
you want with it because that's what

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,080
designers do just so you know I can't

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,350
really give you a full crash course on

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,090
how to do design we don't have that much

00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:21,450
time in fact even if I had the whole

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,310
session is dedicated to small aspects of

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,860
design we wouldn't have enough time I do

00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,390
have a couple crash courses I do have an

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,810
interesting deck and I'll tweet this

00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:33,690
stuff out but what this deck in this in

00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:35,820
this deck would I go through is what is

00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,550
UX design I go through what is a persona

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,970
what is a wireframe what is a site map

00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:44,670
or a user flow how do we how do we make

00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,770
prototypes that are usable right like

00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:48,480
these are all really important UX things

00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,160
that often times when you don't have a

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,480
designer there to remind you of how

00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,980
important they are they get glossed over

00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,870
and then you run into real problems

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,370
later on in the project so yeah if you

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,990
have any questions again about that feel

00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,950
free to talk to me and I can I can help

00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:06,510
you out but what I should say there are

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,810
a few things that you should remember is

00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,760
that design is a skill and if you care

00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,930
about design and obviously you care

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,900
somewhat because you're here in the

00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:18,480
session if you care you can figure it

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,970
out you can grow that skill just like

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,890
any other skill that you might have but

00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,480
it is discouraging it's hard so you're

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,790
going to have to not give up and you're

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,650
going to have to keep practicing which

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,890
means you can't be stuck by paralyzing

00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,210
perfectionism you can't go look on

00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,710
dribble or wherever else you go to get

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,870
inspired and be like I've never made

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,060
anything good in my life right and give

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,560
up you have to say hey I'm not good

00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,980
enough yet but I'm going to keep working

00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,810
through it which means you can't ever

00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:50,400
stay satisfied with your current quality

00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:53,210
of work ultimately you can do it I

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,070
really believe that all developers or

00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,780
anybody if they care enough about design

00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,870
can at least make incremental

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,290
improvements in there

00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:06,280
own design ability or ability to design

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:08,200
design abilities not to work does anyone

00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,640
have any questions or they anybody have

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:14,100
any problems that you currently are

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,100
facing with design in your projects yeah

00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:39,460
okay excellent write that as an

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:43,480
excellent point are you a designer or we

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:45,580
are you a developer designer ux okay so

00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,760
if you came to a project and you said

00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:55,840
hey how do I actually help out with that

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:59,140
ah dang I miss I lost the history well

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,600
we have a I helped out with a get up

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:09,100
with sorry with Jade they needed a new

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:10,720
logo so we ended up of course we can't

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,760
ever find the issue that we wanted all

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,290
right here we go so it started out with

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,140
somebody saying hey is there an official

00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:21,070
logo for Jade so if you are a designer

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:23,320
you don't have to contribute code but if

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,330
they're already using git or github i

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,920
would say jump on github and start going

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,050
through the issues that's it awesome

00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,460
place to get started with design because

00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:33,760
really what you need to do is start

00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,380
designed discussions we we sometimes get

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,670
an open source projects designers who

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,520
are like here's your design see you

00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,260
later right I got that's helpful once

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,360
but it really doesn't help change

00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,280
anything so what we really need is

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
people to come in and start discussing

00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,620
things asking the right questions the

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,570
ones that you ask in meetings when the

00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,800
when the the decision makers like yeah

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,090
we don't like that because it's purple

00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,410
and we don't like purple you're like all

00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,080
right let's talk about that a little bit

00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:01,330
more so I got that a little bit I put up

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,559
some logos for Jade some ideas and I did

00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,630
exactly what I told you you shouldn't

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,460
feel and I just post it there and said

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,440
like yeah and they're like please not

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,019
rabbits right like that was the first

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,579
response I got

00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:15,079
which because I did such a bad job with

00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:17,209
with just posting it there that's

00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,829
totally a valid response and so then I

00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:20,809
started going through and I said

00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:22,099
obviously I made stickers before I got

00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:25,190
approval right because you got to make

00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:26,509
signature so I started going through and

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,489
saying hey let's talk about what

00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:29,959
branding means and let's talk about

00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:34,839
comparable projects that have some

00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:37,969
really fun and and illustrative almost

00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:39,079
brands that are in the same place then

00:26:37,969 --> 00:26:40,579
somebody else said hey they don't like

00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,989
the blend modes that were being used i

00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:43,549
said hey look there's other examples of

00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:45,109
other people using blend modes I wasn't

00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:46,969
trying to just say other people are

00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:48,499
doing it we should do it too but I was

00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:50,899
at least progressing the conversation

00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:53,479
and we started going further with it and

00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:54,979
and the project owner was like hey I

00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:58,519
feel like it's too rough let's make it

00:26:54,979 --> 00:27:00,019
smoother and so then when they start

00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:01,429
asking for too many things like you just

00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:03,229
start throwing all the options you can

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:08,599
and then you turn it into an animated

00:27:03,229 --> 00:27:10,159
gif right and it just it was it was a

00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,049
good conversation and then it ended up I

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,839
ended up posting it on on dribble and

00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:16,849
dribble has a feature where you can

00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,889
rebound posts is the first rebound i

00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:21,019
ever got somebody took my design and the

00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:23,239
source file that i attached to it they

00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:25,789
made a slight change and they posted it

00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:28,489
back up as a rebound so that's the final

00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:30,049
logo that we've gone with and there's

00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:32,509
still more work to do because the logo

00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:35,749
is not the final project but it's a good

00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:37,069
start so anyway this was an example if

00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:39,079
you're a designer and you want to get

00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:40,999
started screenshots are awesome in

00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,529
github issues like I said that handles

00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:45,769
animated gifts what more do you need

00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:49,399
right so starting the conversation there

00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:51,469
I would also recommend I do it all the

00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:53,899
time though nobody seems to really care

00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:55,399
too much but I I post all of my design

00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:57,979
files when i'm working on open source

00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:59,899
projects i posted on pixel apps pixel

00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:02,989
apps will allow people to download those

00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:05,149
files and make changes it also has

00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:06,969
version history in it so it doesn't have

00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:09,199
everything I can't even log in right now

00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:11,119
it doesn't have everything that github

00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:13,069
has but it does have version history so

00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,979
people can go in and annotate individual

00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:18,199
parts of a design through the history of

00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:21,109
it so it's fun pixel apps was recently

00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:22,219
acquired by Dropbox I have no idea

00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:24,330
what's going to happen to the future of

00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:25,890
this project because of that I liked

00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,159
so I hope everything's going to be okay

00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:30,419
with whatever happens but they haven't

00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,890
made any new feature since the

00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:37,429
acquisition which is pretty normal as

00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:37,429
well any other questions about yeah

00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,930
right

00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,220
Oh

00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:06,429
Oh

00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:17,520
isn't that what the designer inside a

00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:20,300
company almost cutting a designer from

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,300
the equation

00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,510
I would hurt I think that's a good point

00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,000
I think that is something to take into

00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,950
consideration but I would say first of

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,720
all there are a ton of open source

00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:46,350
projects that do not have any sort of

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,090
corporate sponsor at all so for open

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,330
source projects there are a lot of

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:52,890
hobbyist open open Sorcerer's but the

00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,210
majority those hobbyists open sources

00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,560
are amateur open source whatever you

00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,300
want to call they're not getting paid

00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,400
but I wouldn't calm amateur either some

00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,070
of them are extremely talented amateur

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,170
denotes that they're not but we don't

00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,760
have enough designers for those projects

00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:08,730
so that's the first one they're not

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,680
taking anybody's job by doing that the

00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:14,580
second one though for those projects

00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:16,170
that do have corporate sponsors I would

00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,420
say it's just the same as developers

00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:20,670
when we have developers who are working

00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,170
on corporate sponsored open source

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,730
projects we're not worried about getting

00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,890
so many contributions that those people

00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:29,100
aren't going to have jobs anymore like

00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:31,050
that's not a problem that we face if

00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,700
anything the more contributions you get

00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:35,970
the more important those people's jobs

00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,740
are to be able to their job changes

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,450
they've got to be able to figure out how

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,640
to work with people making pull requests

00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,530
and how to keep the code clean and a

00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,080
cohesive project while you have so many

00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,520
different people working on it and the

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,640
designer's role would change as well

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,400
ultimately every project would have a

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,050
creative director on it it doesn't have

00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,790
to be a full-time job for that project

00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,050
but ultimately that's what it should be

00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:01,020
should be able to have people making

00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:03,240
design contributions and somebody in the

00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,830
role because you don't want designed by

00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,390
committee so you should have somebody in

00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,730
the role of saying hey you know what

00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,320
that works this doesn't work let me

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,790
mentor you through this so that we can

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,310
make it work together and now we have a

00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,810
cohesive design some people have told me

00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,840
that open source design can't work

00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:20,190
because designs not modular like

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,240
development is you can have three

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,440
different people working on three

00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,690
different sides of a project on the

00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,560
development thing and that designs not

00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:31,830
that way I think that's a lie I think

00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,510
that you can set up guidelines design

00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,790
guidelines and then from there you have

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:40,350
plenty of people that could help fill in

00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:41,880
those gaps so yeah I don't think we have

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,240
to worry about designers taking away

00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,910
jobs by contributing to open source

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,290
if we get to that problem I would love

00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,690
that problem that would be an awesome

00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:56,050
problem to have because that means we're

00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:56,050
getting a ton of contributions yeah

00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:13,900
it's it is it's an uphill climb I think

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:15,520
a lot of its going to be we can borrow a

00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,070
lot of what the development community

00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,470
has done and apply it to designers I

00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:22,600
think it will fit a lot of the times it

00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,030
can be things like extending invitations

00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,920
where it makes sense in whatever format

00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,570
designers want to that's thing if you're

00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,309
an open source project owner and you're

00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,929
looking for designers to come contribute

00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:33,910
and somebody comes in and gives you a

00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,860
PSD file you don't complain hey that's

00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,650
not working for what we're doing you say

00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,030
thank you very much in the future if

00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,770
you'd like to use github this is how we

00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,750
work but we appreciate any contribution

00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:46,660
we can get right like that's how that's

00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:48,130
how we that's how we welcome new people

00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,840
we don't just say hey you're not doing

00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:53,530
it the right way and close their pull

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,809
request you make comments on it so same

00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,309
thing with designers you you say thank

00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:00,010
you for what you're doing we invite you

00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:02,110
to continue to participate and then you

00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,940
do your best to pay them back and

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,380
oftentimes that's in recognition if

00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,550
you've got a Twitter account for your

00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,350
project that you got a ton of people

00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,090
following you say hey this person

00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,620
designed this they did a ton of design

00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,510
work they're huge contributors to the

00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,300
project we're very grateful I know who

00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:17,559
the designer is on the sass logo because

00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,929
the project did a good job of saying

00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:21,610
thank you we really appreciate all the

00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:25,530
contributions you have made please

00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:29,670
continue to do so that's what we need

00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:29,670
get them giving them the warm fuzzies

00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:34,470
anybody else any anybody else having any

00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:37,470
problems with design in their projects

00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,470
yeah

00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:44,620
so we are designers developers to maybe

00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,900
jump into something like sketch which is

00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:49,660
much easier for I guess says to also

00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,760
have that kind of collaborative and a

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,860
component to it with them even given

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,450
suggestions and ideas not course within

00:33:53,860 --> 00:34:00,700
the guidelines right that we appreciated

00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:03,850
think we appreciated that we can use

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:07,450
tool we're constantly changing but

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:09,960
design teams that we encountered are you

00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:13,090
locked into Photoshop or illustrator

00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,919
there's really it's really a struggle to

00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,780
try to get that open until you think

00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:19,240
knowledge I don't know you know better

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:22,659
ways of course my kind of culture to

00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,950
where they're open I would say back off

00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:27,159
of them a little bit and see if you can

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:28,780
take stuff off their their plate or see

00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,280
if you can hire more designers so

00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,869
they're not feeling so strapped if you

00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,399
got designers who are strapped or

00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:36,310
developers as well they're not going to

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,570
try new tools if they're too busy just

00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,950
trying to keep up with their workload

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,629
they're not going to be like oh that's

00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:44,590
sweet let me try something that takes me

00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:46,450
ten times longer to do it in right that

00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,040
being said I do as part of the

00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:50,440
open-source design foundation we

00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:54,100
encourage designers to get involved in

00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,869
coding at least HTML CSS and JavaScript

00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,369
because the majority of projects that

00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:59,410
they're going to be involved in probably

00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:01,810
need that as their format and the reason

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:03,220
that we're encouraging that not so that

00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,140
they're writing production code but a

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,180
prototype written in HTML CSS and

00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,400
JavaScript is much more useful to a

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,470
developer than a PSD file so they're

00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,710
better at communicating that way also if

00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:16,420
you if you're designing in code even if

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,690
it's rough gross code that's totally

00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:21,880
cool you get all the benefits of the of

00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,740
the co decoders workflow right you get

00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,490
all of the benefits of these tools that

00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:29,859
developers have built for collaborating

00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:33,430
you can also try and push SVG more just

00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:34,930
so happens to be a text-based format so

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:38,200
you get some benefits out of it that way

00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:41,109
though we do have github has just added

00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,030
a large file support which is

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:48,850
interesting and again you've got things

00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:51,290
like like pixel apps but trying to force

00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:53,390
designers into a specific workflow

00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:54,800
usually work out very well you've got to

00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,480
somehow convince them why that's

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,800
important or why it's useful but the

00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,180
same thing happens with developers you

00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,790
can't be like hey developers you're now

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,710
using grunt and they're like ah but gulp

00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:05,120
is so much better right like you're

00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,160
going to get that one guy who keeps

00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,400
introducing a gulp file you like stop it

00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:13,900
right like we're doing grunt so yeah

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,900
just something that you gotta yeah

00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:42,339
as possible if you want to ask your

00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,380
design team to switch to other tools

00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:46,299
that's the thing is it's not about the

00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,130
the tooling of the tooling would be nice

00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:50,439
if we had open source tooling it would

00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,179
be nice i'm going to i would totally i'm

00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:54,179
on board with that in fact i would love

00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:58,509
if adobe tomorrow said hey you know it

00:36:54,179 --> 00:37:01,329
we're now using PSD x right like an open

00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:02,619
file format for PSD's like that would be

00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:04,659
awesome i'd be totally on board with

00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:06,039
that they've got weird licensing stuff

00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:08,619
that they'd have to sort through and

00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:11,999
that's not my department so can't make

00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:11,999
that decision but yeah

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,770
yeah if we if we there are some

00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,570
interesting workflows that we could work

00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:33,340
through I don't think anyone has

00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:36,190
successfully done the whole fork emerged

00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,960
in the paradigm or in the in the aspect

00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:41,650
of design like no one's been able to

00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,240
really figure that one out so I think

00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:45,010
there's definitely room for disruption

00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,810
right there like if you want to call it

00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:51,070
that go start a start-up make some

00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:53,650
t-shirts but yeah we haven't we haven't

00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:55,570
quite solved that yet but there's a lot

00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,640
of stuff that could be utilized right

00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:00,730
now a Photoshop actually has no j/s

00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,380
running in it it's got something called

00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,780
generator if you wanted to that you

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:07,270
could go and build extensions for

00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:13,690
completely open source it's really

00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:18,220
interesting and I think we'll see some

00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:19,240
more functionality coming out we're

00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,040
going to record it I can't talk about

00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,230
anything all right but i would say check

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,730
out generator generators awesome if

00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,020
you've got people who are using

00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,240
photoshop i'm not actually a photoshop

00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:31,150
user i'm an illustrator guy i like

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,680
sketch nothing wrong with sketch um but

00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,200
I still I feel most at home an

00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,180
illustrator personally but generators

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,800
awesome so you might find some solutions

00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,800
in there yeah

00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:58,840
yeah like yeah I think I think we'll

00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,850
start to see some bleed over from there

00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,680
I think sasses is an interesting point

00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:04,360
where people kind of jump in designers

00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,400
who are told about the benefits of

00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,450
preprocessors and specifically SAS or

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,370
like this is the greatest thing ever

00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:11,320
like an it's open source and I'm like oh

00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,850
what's that right so they're learning

00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,010
about some of the stuff in an

00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,780
interesting way but it's useful to them

00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,520
it's part of their workflow and that

00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:21,730
provides the motivation so they're

00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,740
already excited about doing it again if

00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,690
you're developing an application that a

00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:29,410
designer will never use it's a tough

00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:32,080
sell to get them to contribute to it we

00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:33,430
have no time so if you have any

00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,560
questions feel free to come up and talk

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:37,150
to me I don't want to run over on the

00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,450
next person but thank you so much for

00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,450
