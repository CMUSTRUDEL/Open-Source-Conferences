all right now we want to just take a

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,490
quick moment to welcome you and tell you

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,559
a little bit things about open source

00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,449
com be added a chance to stop by the

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,250
booth yet I like to describe open source

00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,410
com as an online community and

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,240
publication talking about and

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,560
highlighting how open source is changing

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,669
the world and we like to collect your

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,230
stories and we're going to tell you

00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:26,230
about ways that you can contribute

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,450
and they're quite a few ways you can

00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,880
contribute you can actually ping us on

00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,580
any of our social networks if you have

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,950
questions you can email us at open at

00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:42,110
open source com you can submit we have a

00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,700
web form online that will ask you a few

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,220
questions and help walk you through the

00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,340
process of drafting them an outline idea

00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,960
and it's open source com / story and you

00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,730
can also find us and some of our

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,920
community moderators hanging out in

00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,920
freenode IRC on open source com

00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:02,540
so a few reasons why you should

00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,890
contribute we've had stories of people

00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,940
that have written for us that have

00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,800
gotten a job because of what they were

00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,900
in so that's really cool you can elevate

00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,820
your own personal profile grow your

00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,310
network we do a lot of interview series

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,300
on the site and connect you with with

00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,190
people throughout the open source

00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,530
community it's a different way to

00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,590
contribute back to open source a lot of

00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,580
folks kind of default to thinking that

00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,990
most of the contributions have to be

00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,940
code related so this is a way to

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,970
actually help market your projects and

00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,160
get some more visibility on to them our

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,190
team provides editorial services so if

00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,780
your English is not your first language

00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,840
or if you don't feel like a strong rider

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,270
we can help improve those improve your

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,190
writing a couple folks think that we're

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,740
lovable we get hugs at our booth very

00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,850
often and we just think it's it's really

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,970
easy to write for us so I think the

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,229
biggest barrier that we see with with

00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,160
getting contributions as people just

00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,130
don't know that they can contribute

00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,850
their story

00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,260
and so oh uh quick success stories

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,180
hopefully most of you were here

00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,710
yesterday to hear Jim Whitehurst the sea

00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,450
of red hat talk about his book the open

00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,119
organization we saw a great opportunity

00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,280
to expand our editorial content and talk

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,140
about open source and leadership and so

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,420
we've launched a new section earlier

00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:17,860
this year that's talking about a lot of

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:20,380
the principles in the open organization

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,270
we had a community called be code that

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,970
published an article with us in January

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,890
of this year and their project was

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,420
basically their investors of the project

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,360
weren't going to open source the code

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,680
base until they hit 10,000 users so you

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,050
can see on the graph here where they

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,420
would we publish the article and their

00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,700
user ate a skyrocketed and so their

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,840
investors actually decided to to

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,490
open-source the code base because they

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,660
had so much momentum now we can't

00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,520
guarantee that for every single project

00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,420
but here's a great example of a

00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,700
successful one

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,989
we're also able to cover a nice wide

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,940
range of stories and contributions from

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,800
people from all around the world one

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,200
story we did a couple months ago was an

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,599
interview with Patricia Torvalds her

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,130
father is the creator of Linux in case

00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,989
you haven't you're not familiar with

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,220
lenis torvalds and but she just

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,319
graduated from high school recently

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,480
she's attending Duke and we sent her an

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,459
interview and it was really interesting

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,380
to see her answers because as a high

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,450
school or she gave us some perspective

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,670
on what's actually working that we don't

00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,769
hear about sometimes for example in her

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,120
interview she told us that and being

00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,160
acknowledged in high school and getting

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,260
an award for some competing science

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,330
project that she did and then having

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,819
access to network of other women in tech

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:34,100
had really worked well for her and then

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,750
to follow up for that story I have been

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,730
to several events since then where

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,350
attendees I've overheard them talking or

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,790
they've come up to me and said how

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,180
inspiring it was to see the next

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,769
generation and you know testifying that

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,540
these things that we're doing that we

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,850
never hear the results of are actually

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,319
working and so this is one of the many

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,990
success stories you'll find on our site

00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,640
and we'd like to hear more of yours also

00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,010
so that's what we have for you today I

00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,990
just want to mention that in addition to

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,120
the send-off social at beck's bucks car

00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,920
this evening we will have an open source

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,320
com meet up there starting at 9pm so

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,170
come on over we'll have some game tokens

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,370
and maybe a few extra t-shirts so thank

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:17,180
you and enjoy the rest of the lightning

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:19,880
talks thank you thank you ricky and

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,420
Jason so we're about to get started

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,730
folks seatbelt sign is lit go ahead and

00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,260
sit back and get ready the first person

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,220
that I want to introduce is Daniel

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,660
Farrell who is going to be talking about

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,520
introduction to vagrant you got five

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,600
minutes hello everyone plus one to the

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,940
seatbelts we're gonna be moving quickly

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,920
we got our slides ok my name is Daniel

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,710
Farrell I worked for red hat under the

00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,900
R&D office on the SDN team I'm deeper

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,030
la7 everywhere uh and you find my

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,710
clicker

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,910
which brings me to I just tweeted out

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,800
these slides so if you want to find

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,160
those that's how you would do it DFA or

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,930
our e ll 07 so what's vagrant jumping in

00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,340
we have very little time quickest way I

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,020
can put it simple swag and put it as

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,670
it's a tool for working with virtual

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,960
machines in fact it's a modular

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,130
framework for working with virtual

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,410
machines which we'll see more of in a

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,190
second it all starts with a vagrant file

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,810
and it's kind of all orchestrated

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,220
through that vagrant file so they can be

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,020
very simple you'll see more examples in

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,000
a second and then very simple commands

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,520
so vagrant up vagran SSH and then we

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,990
have a shell that's cool but we've been

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,670
able to work with vagrant or with

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,830
virtual machines to the CLI for a long

00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,180
time so vbox manage creat vm we could

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,580
wrap scripts around this and have

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,530
similar functionality for a very nice

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,570
rant that Mitchell went and did on

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,920
hacker news for us we have some insight

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,110
into sort of the harder problems that

00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,340
they solved with vagrant it you know on

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,740
top of what could be done with shell

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,270
scripts a lot of that is around cross OS

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,860
support so vagrant is across iOS

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,680
platform you can use it without sex or

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,850
windows or various linux distributions

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,930
it also does a lot of networking out of

00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,190
the box where you so as soon as you

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,680
stand up your vm all have your networks

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,300
working and that's cross OS it also does

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,830
a lot of synced directory work for you

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,690
so the directory that contains your

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,550
vagrant file automatically gets synced

00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,140
into your box and vice versa here i'm

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,000
showing the contents of root vagrant and

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,770
then i'm creating a new file root

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,300
vagrant foo and then I'm logging out of

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,110
the VM and showing that it's been synced

00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,400
back to my local system finally it

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,170
solves all these problems in a modular

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,130
way which will show in a second which

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,740
would be very difficult for shell

00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,810
scripts so here's a really important

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,400
concepts Zola and difficult thing there

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,200
are two really important keywords here

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,630
in vagrant world provisioners and

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,020
providers provisioners and providers

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,370
provisioners and providers key concepts

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,990
jumping in provisioners or sorry

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,790
providers provide virtualization support

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,500
essentially they magic VMs into

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,410
existence there are two types of

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,150
providers local and remote local

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,450
providers are things like VirtualBox

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,860
lipford VMware docker yes docker so you

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,690
can manage containers not just virtual

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,100
machines when I said it's a vm

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,610
management tool there was a slight white

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,770
lie there

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,129
also remote providers things like

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,590
OpenStack digitalocean AWS second major

00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:57,110
P word for vision errs provisioners

00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,960
provision the vm or they do shared

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,340
repeatable configuration against the vm

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,810
there's some simple on-ramp provisioners

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,370
like the shell provisioner you can do

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,680
just in line commands you can point at

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,360
shell scripts nice little way to get

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,650
started they're also powerful options

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,229
for people who need things like that so

00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:17,180
ansible roles puppet puppet chefs all

00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,560
public modules you can mix and match as

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,389
a vagrant partitioner you would then go

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,500
in mix-and-match provisioners and

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,270
providers based on the knowledge that

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,979
you have to sort of solve the use case

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,599
that you need let's see that through

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,340
some examples here's kind of the most

00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,409
minimal example we're saying vagrant and

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,180
knit dash mne the name of the box that

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:34,879
creates the file that we're catting out

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,110
in the second command here the file says

00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,729
that we want to start with a fresh Intel

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,310
seven environment and do no additional

00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:42,110
configuration we can then boot this

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,909
virtual machine with vagrant up that

00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,860
downloads our base box if we don't have

00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:47,810
it cached locally already it boots the

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,210
VM and it does our cross OS networking

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,099
and synced folder or magic we can then

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,979
connect with vigor and ssh and huzzah we

00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:56,839
have a shell on our new machine a second

00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,069
example quickly this uses the shell

00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,719
provisioner so we have the similar

00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,400
configuration on the first line in this

00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:03,199
case we're starting from a fedora 22 box

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,029
and then we're saying we want to run

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,199
this in line shell command which in this

00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:08,779
our case installed some system

00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,909
dependencies using dnf we can boot our

00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,500
box with vagrant up again we do the same

00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:14,270
networking and shared directory magic

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,379
and then we run our shell / visionary

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,050
which will install the system

00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:20,539
dependencies as we'd expect third

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,710
example this one uses ansible so a first

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,009
line similar we're starting with a

00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:27,110
vagrant base box that's for door 22

00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,849
second trunk is the configuration for

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,900
the ansible provisioner basically what's

00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,219
going on is that we're pointing at a

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,419
playbook file which is kind of an

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,979
ansible thing that you don't really need

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,169
to understand but it's pretty simple

00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,789
we're saying for all hosts as root

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,500
install open daylight which is a project

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,610
that I contribute to accept all the

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,190
defaults

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,410
when we do our vagrant up we do the same

00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,970
magic around networking and such and

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,620
then we run our ansible provision air

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,000
that installs opendaylight we can

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,589
connect to our box with vigor and ssh

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,120
and then use sudo system control as

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:55,060
active opendaylight to verify that our

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,589
open daylight system d services running

00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,209
so concluding with some sort of

00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,529
high-level points about why I think you

00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:02,029
should use vagrant why it's an awesome

00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:03,470
tool it provides well defined

00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,910
environments that you understand right

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,779
so you know what you installed you know

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,040
what's configured in this environment

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,320
you can go back and reference that

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,430
easily it's also easy to share those

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,320
environments with your team members

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,970
though this can be like your individual

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,260
team members in a company particularly

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,700
powerful for open source communities

00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,670
though I will attest as we use it all

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,019
the time in the upstream the vagrant

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,640
file that sort of defines all of this

00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,690
has done is in version control so

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,880
there's lots of benefits around that

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,700
looking at the history the contributions

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,519
going back in time being able to review

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,440
code as it's changing and such it also

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,519
replaces binary vm artifacts which is

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,769
sort of the traditional thing that we're

00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,329
switching out here so bmv and blobs have

00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:40,850
issues around figuring out what software

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:42,230
is installed in them and copyright

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,459
things that follow from that so this is

00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,170
a nice win for open source projects as

00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,399
well your environment and code shipped

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,959
together so when you get pull your

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,190
repository you also get the vagrant file

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,320
that defines the environment of how to

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,329
run it you're able to reuse existing

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,100
logic around configuration management so

00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:57,320
if you have a complicated project that

00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,820
you've solved the deployment with an

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,410
ansible role or something you cannot

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,690
duplicate that effort and just consume

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,490
it in vagrant your local deploys and

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,140
your remote deploys look very similar so

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,910
if your dev working on software on your

00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,320
local bars and you're not you have an

00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,820
ops person as well their deployment

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,769
pipeline will look very similar to stand

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,070
up in tens of these pieces of software

00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:15,900
in production

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,430
that's all I have and I'm out of time my

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:22,830
name is Daniel Farrell again d fellow 7

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:25,310
everywhere thank you for your time well

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,310
done

00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,790
that was impressive thank you very much

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,650
so I'd like to introduce now Jen Krieger

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,140
who's going to be talking about common

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,350
misconceptions using agile in open

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,350
source

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,939
hi everybody I'm Jen Krieger and I'm an

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,740
agile coach at Red Hat working with the

00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:55,319
team's developing project atomic and

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,389
open shift earlier this year Fedora

00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:59,639
project leader Matt Miller asked me if I

00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:02,069
would go to Bruno and do an agile talk

00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:03,689
for dev com my talk went through a few

00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:05,939
durations but it winded up somewhere in

00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:08,339
the space of how project atomic was

00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:10,589
delivering software using agile

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,319
principles and practices I worked really

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,059
hard on that talk and I thought I did an

00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,889
excellent job however when I returned to

00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:18,509
the states a few weeks later I received

00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:21,509
what I classifies the most epic

00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,850
conference feedback ever your talk was

00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:26,660
boop

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,610
I was dismayed but in reality it

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,670
solidified a thought that I had for a

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,899
while which i think is a large problem

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,870
with the way that we talk about agile

00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,149
which technically is exactly that the

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,560
way we talk about agile a jal's have

00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:40,540
failed to deliver the message in a way

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,279
that the open source community

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,980
understands because let's face it the

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,110
current market for agile is essentially

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,050
an executive or a manager looking to

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,300
purchase training to help help their

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,819
team solve their problems so i'm here to

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,529
give you to the 5-minute rundown of how

00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,880
we can get around the marketing of agile

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:00,980
and to get to the truth of what it

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,600
really is intended to be and the way i

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,819
like to have this conversation is simple

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,730
i'm going to talk about four things that

00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:09,170
i have heard recently at Red Hat and if

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,180
you notice somebody blushing in the

00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,490
audience chances are it's that person

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,589
who said it

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,470
angela has two weeks prints that would

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:22,010
never work in an open source community

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:24,590
agile isn't hot scrum scrum is about to

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,560
expense but it doesn't always have to be

00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:30,140
what you use in fact scrum is one of

00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:34,400
40-plus methods that suggests how people

00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:37,420
could work together however XP konban

00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,560
the scaled agile framework lean

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,630
large-scale scrum Spotify squad

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,460
ification method DevOps these are all

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,590
things that are aligned with agile and

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,230
they kind of suggests how you can be

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,810
agile however i'm hoping the majority of

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,000
you have on you know maybe heard

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,520
released early release often which was a

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,400
philosophy that was popularized by eric

00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,840
raymond via his essay the cathedral in

00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,690
the bazaar bazaar was basically

00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,000
publisher on 1997 which was largely

00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:07,600
written based on observations of how the

00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,920
linux kernel colonel community worked

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,860
and although i don't think the original

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,140
signers of the enema angela manifesto

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,640
you know stoled from open source i think

00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,550
the intention and spirit behind it was

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,470
actually very similar agile is all about

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,980
speed forget design quality security and

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,380
documentation

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,660
agile is not always about speed but it

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,100
is about fast feedback loops so whatever

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,899
method you choose the intention behind

00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,600
the implementation is that you get

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,490
feedback and basically on what you're

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,800
working on the code you're writing as

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,120
soon as possible great a duelists know

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,649
that the way to get feedback is tap

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,660
version control in place continuous

00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,760
integration delivery automated testing

00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,290
you name it similar the way that open

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,000
source communities could potentially use

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,160
github and Jenkins to provide feedback

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,790
on a PR that is potentially going to

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,860
merge

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,540
agile only allows for one person to

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,910
define the product requirements the

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,790
product owner so who is this mysterious

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,500
product owner anyway the product owner

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,540
is a role that is basically defined

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,220
within the concept of scrum basic this

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,110
person is responsible help guide the

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,210
development teams to make sure they stay

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,010
on track and generally they work with a

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,540
product manager to understands the

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,000
market or understands where the product

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,740
needs to go consider the concept of a

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,060
product owner very similar to a core

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,730
maintainer within an open-source

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,990
community commentators are generally

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,270
someone who is going to review code

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,420
provide comments or eventually merge

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,560
functionality that is intuitive or

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,690
respectful of what it is they want their

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,940
project to do so I would say well the

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,070
names may be new to some of you it's not

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,660
a concept that is actually new at all

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,360
it's probably something that you're

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,370
already doing abs or acquire is people

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,420
to be in the same place I get the

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,490
impression that when we talk about

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,960
kool-aid co-located teams everyone is

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,680
thinking that it looks something like

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,050
this I assure you having everyone close

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,760
helps with communication but it's not a

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,650
hundred percent necessary in terms of

00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,970
doing agile it's just one of those

00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,190
things that makes things a little bit

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,600
easier and I would argue that open

00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,370
source community already knows that true

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,310
because the evidence is a here in this

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,500
room conference is like all things open

00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:11,260
bring communion members together to help

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,240
us make that face-to-face relationship

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,190
before scattering off to the wind and

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,960
using old school forms of mass

00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:20,770
communication that we're used to using

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,290
and so while many agile trainers are all

00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,670
about having teams in one place and they

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,830
say that's pretty much the only way to

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,690
do it I would say be aware of what your

00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,190
community needs to be successful and

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,760
adjust the way that you're doing to bend

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,440
around those needs

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,700
and please don't bulk because someone

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,850
said the term agile to you and you were

00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,850
like a instead think agile just forked

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,130
the open source community and used it to

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:47,350
use to create software and add it a

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,350
little bit more code to it thank you

00:15:54,329 --> 00:16:01,019
thank you kindly alright so moving right

00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,569
along our next speaker is Steven jayvon

00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:07,850
Nichols he's going to be talking about

00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:07,850
Linux through the eyes of a journalist

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,399
hello hello are we do have power hi my

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,310
name is Steven jayvon Nichols I write

00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,420
about this stuff

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:30,450
Wow there I am in my old office I have a

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,510
much nicer office now so how does

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:35,670
someone with a Liberal Arts degrees and

00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,279
who you know i'm an english and history

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:41,790
guy how does someone like me end up in

00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,850
linux well I'll tell you how once upon a

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:48,120
time there I was a newly minted PhD in

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:53,010
history with all those job offers just

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:55,470
pouring into me geez what could I do

00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:59,160
well I'll tell you what I could do i

00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:01,650
discovered that i could read good scale

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,709
reading don't you think i could write

00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,470
and I could do research I also

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,630
discovered and this I did not know I'm

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,630
one of those people who I just get

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:16,620
computers

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:22,199
so so the little clicker doesn't work

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:25,920
little clicker there we go and so there

00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:29,070
i was i could get computers i could read

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:32,460
i could write i actually ended up in

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:35,809
guess what computer science and in

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:41,610
technology and i started out actually

00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:45,210
working with IBM 360 mainframes my first

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:47,730
language was IBM 360 assembler

00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:51,299
you don't want that to be your first

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,600
language you really don't and then I

00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:56,000
found

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,480
PDP 1170 and when what was running on

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,320
that PDP 1178 come on folks you should

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:06,559
know this basic history unix that's

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:10,039
right and I thought jeez this is good

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:13,700
stuff I can use this and so I started

00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:16,100
picking up unix and now I discovered

00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,789
that technology still doesn't work

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:22,400
aha there we go and from there I

00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:26,059
discovered you know what I like this

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,960
enough I want it on a desktop say hi to

00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:34,130
my first unix desktop anyone anyone else

00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:37,309
here use this thing yeah it ran system 5

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:39,260
released three point two eunuchs back in

00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:42,530
the day and that's where I picked up

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:44,929
that and it was nifty and it was neat

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:48,260
and it got me thinking I can also

00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:52,770
besides speaking see I could speak

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:55,650
English that's a rare combination

00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,840
and so it was I started writing about

00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,880
this stuff first just to other

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,870
technology people and then I discovered

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,690
I could translate from C to English to

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:09,690
people who think that C is a letter in

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,390
the alphabet between B and D and that's

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:15,450
all they know and so it was that I

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:17,520
started working on things like open

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,010
desktop anyone here used to work with

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,830
that one good old open desktop also

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,140
known as open death trap because once

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:28,200
you're in it terrible things could

00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,360
happen to you terrible terrible things

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,510
at the time though there were other

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,460
people who were doing things on the

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,500
shell level and goodness knows i know

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,860
she'll and i remember when the big user

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,270
interface it's based were between c and

00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:45,450
bourne shell and then eventually

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:47,550
something called born again shell and so

00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,530
I was doing all this I was starting to

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,950
write about it and making a living at it

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,650
and then along came this Fang called

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:59,090
Linux

00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,680
and I remember back when gosh I forget

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,050
what year it is now but we're about

00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,780
going on 25 years of Linux were getting

00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:08,900
close to that and i discovered that

00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,820
linux was actually need that this little

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,060
finished graduate student with a really

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:16,430
funny name on the MINIX news group was

00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,500
on the thump team and so i started

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:21,920
working with Linux starting with the

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,110
release 0.03 which Lennon's will tell

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:28,910
you what's the first one that really

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:31,700
worked and so it is I took my background

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,790
of liberal arts reading writing and

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,400
research added to it my ability to do

00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:40,880
interesting things with computers and on

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,290
top of that i added what i think and i

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,510
think most of us in this room would

00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:47,900
agree is still the most powerful

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,930
operating system today as it gets near

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:54,110
to its age it gets near to its first

00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:57,080
quarter century and that's how it is

00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:59,030
that someone who really studied east

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,100
africa and diplomatic history and

00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:04,850
english renaissance drama and i'm not

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:07,490
making that up ended up making a living

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,890
about writing about linux and using

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,570
linux because it's not just for

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,060
technical people it's not just for

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:17,420
engineers it's also for people like me

00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:19,730
who just really like great operating

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,360
systems in great tools thank you very

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,360
much for your time

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,380
thank you

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,809
Oh Thank You Stephen all right moving

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,540
along quickly our next speaker is going

00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:41,520
to be the inestimable Jamie Duncan who's

00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,450
going to be talking about gleaming the

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,450
cube Janey

00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:51,059
hey everybody how you doing all right so

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,670
you can take your seat belts off I've

00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:56,250
got like five slots

00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:59,710
so first and foremost the important

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:02,020
question I have to ask who gets the joke

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,880
you know when no one has ever seen

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,200
Christian Slater's epic gleaming the

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,510
cube

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,090
all right well that's lost on all of you

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,409
and I feel bad about that so a couple of

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,480
months ago I guess it was a couple of

00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:15,429
months ago I was down at the Red Hat

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,200
user group down near the Red Hat tower

00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:18,549
and Jason hibbett says hey do you want

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,760
to come talk about Cooper Nettie's in

00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:22,670
five minutes

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,010
and I laughed and I said no you can't do

00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:29,060
that that's just quite simply impossible

00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:32,720
so okay cool I'll do that so me not

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:35,540
being a very smart man so you can't do

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,830
how Cooper Nettie's in five minutes we

00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,240
can talk about it being written in go

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,190
and we can talk about it being a google

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,690
project and we can talk about at CD and

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,160
we can talk about all the other

00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,470
components and bits and stuff and I'll

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,750
run out of time wait before we get to

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,880
anything meaningful but the one point I

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,260
can't make in five minutes at least i

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,700
hope i can try to make in five minutes

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,130
we can know why Cooper daddies

00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,890
I miku benetti's is a tool that exists

00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,590
it's part of atomic it's part of core OS

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,480
it's part of most most modern

00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,650
application Cindric or most modern

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,920
container syndra Kapalua tools out there

00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,720
why why did why does it exist well and

00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,540
and I'd this next slide this is the one

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,970
that I hope gets the docker guy not to

00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:21,090
want to beat me up but containers are

00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,860
really just colonel parlor tricks and I

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,860
say that and I and I say that earnestly

00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,530
but I say that to try to make the point

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:31,440
what containers are are things that live

00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,150
only inside the colonel they only live

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,020
inside the Linux kernel that's the only

00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:38,160
place they exist if you are Thomas's

00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,410
container and security talk of you at

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,140
the core OS talk yesterday you had a

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,930
really good really good introduction

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,340
into what containers are containers are

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,260
Colonel control groups containers are

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,669
selinux and containers to Colonel

00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,799
namespaces

00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:55,649
so if they're everything that a

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,840
container is is inside the colonel how

00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:59,820
does it know when I want my application

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,489
to span three servers or three data

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,559
centers or three planets or whatever how

00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:07,230
does it know what past that and the

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:11,159
answer is it doesn't containers only

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:13,379
exist inside the colonel that's it so to

00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,450
have to be able to scale out a modern

00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:17,909
highly resilient all of those fun

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,070
buzzwords application we have to have

00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:22,080
Cooper Nettie's we have to have a tool

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,759
that will take my kernel and take four

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,830
other kernels or 40 other kernels and

00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,989
glue them all together and let me see

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,909
them as one abstracted out whole that's

00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:32,039
what it does and that's in the rest of

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,779
it is bits and they're fun bits that i

00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:36,059
wish i could get into we could i have

00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,950
two minutes and 19 seconds left so we're

00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,960
not be able to do that so colonel

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,470
containers are awesome colonel parlor

00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,620
tricks they really are

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:48,880
the Korres guys not here today is he did

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:52,299
he leave if good cuz he's probably gonna

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,059
want to beat me up after I say that so

00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:56,950
what kuru Nettie's does do is it takes

00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:58,390
all of those colonel constructs and it

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,220
lets you make the highly available apps

00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,950
and do all sorts of fun things and

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:05,679
that's what it's there for

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:08,019
so I guess in if I had a submarine I

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,549
really don't have a summary that uh but

00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:12,970
in the how we can't get into but the Y

00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:14,350
Combinator's is one of the most

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,019
important tools out there I think today

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,789
I'm containers are parlor tricks but

00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:20,919
they're also revolutionising the data

00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:22,419
center containers are changing how we

00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,250
think about technology and I'm not gonna

00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:26,950
say DevOps but i'll go ahead and say dev

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:29,289
ops they're really making us rethink you

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,090
know there is a new mode to IT and the

00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:33,039
whole bimodal thing people kind of

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,350
cringe and especially in this room

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,149
probably people cringe a lot but it's

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,380
making us rethink how we do software and

00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:41,260
it's making us rethink how we deliver

00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,639
software so we have to have a tool

00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,799
that's gonna get out there and let us

00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:46,419
let us make that next step and that's

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,649
what kuber Nettie's is I think it's a

00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,649
really good I think it's a really good

00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:53,110
start to it so so that's the point I

00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,370
wanted to come up in May that we have to

00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,169
have kuber Nettie's because we have to

00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,830
have containers and containers can't

00:25:56,169 --> 00:25:59,570
think outside the colonel

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,750
and that's what I've got I have 50

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,520
seconds left

00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,200
I wish we could have questions but if

00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,150
anyone wants to rough me up I'll be

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,150
outside thanks

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,450
all right Thank You Jamie that was

00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:18,220
fantastic so moving along I want to

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,710
introduce to you sara khan who's going

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,880
to talk about five ways to make a more

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,880
inclusive event

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:35,120
alright is this mic working yes alright

00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,160
i'm sara khan i am a co-leader of our

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,200
local chapter of girl develop it girl

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,330
develop it is a national nonprofit that

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,280
provides technical education for women

00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,350
we do coding classes we do social

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,660
networking events we try to connect

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,929
women with jobs and technology and we

00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:53,220
get a lot of email

00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:53,220
let me see if the clicker works

00:26:55,049 --> 00:27:00,600
there we go okay so one of the questions

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:03,419
that we get asked a lot is how do we get

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,009
more women to come to our events and the

00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,809
thing about that is women are in a

00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:08,850
monolithic group women are people and

00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:11,549
they have different reasons for doing

00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:13,139
what they choose to do or not to do but

00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,360
pretty much the only thing we can do is

00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:18,299
encourage them if you want more women to

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,970
come to your event make it friendly and

00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:22,679
so I'm going to go over five things that

00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,239
I've learned in my two years being a

00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,309
co-leader they've worked pretty well for

00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:28,489
us and hopefully they could work for you

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:28,489
too

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:35,570
okay so the first thing this seems like

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:37,250
it should be common sense to make sure

00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,289
that your event is in an accessible

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,360
space but with tech meetups sometimes

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:43,610
they're in old conference rooms and

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,240
upstairs and places that are strange are

00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:49,659
hard to get to and accessibility also

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,610
includes digital spaces it includes

00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:54,470
things like letting people know that

00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,539
they can opt out of having their picture

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,919
taken and posted in the case of women

00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:00,740
maybe they have an abusive ex they're

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,659
trying to hide from make sure that

00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,690
basically just make sure that people

00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:07,100
understand that you're open to meeting

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,110
their needs and that you value their

00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,600
participation so that they don't just

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,049
quietly opt out and never tell you that

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,049
it was a problem

00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:20,390
going along with that I want to give

00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,919
kudos to all things open for having such

00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:23,690
a prominent and excellent code of

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,120
conduct basically having a code of

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,860
conduct just says this is the community

00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,919
that we are these are our values and we

00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:33,820
will enforce them and that can encourage

00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:33,820
people to come participate

00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:40,499
another thing you can do is to branch

00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,539
out beyond the usual suspects Aztec

00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:43,889
people it's really easy to think that

00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,659
once you've posted something on Twitter

00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:48,330
everybody knows about it and that's not

00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:49,879
necessarily the case for girl develop it

00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:52,619
we've had great success in reaching

00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:54,600
underserved communities and we've done

00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:57,690
things like partner with community

00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,090
colleges and post to library bulletin

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,759
boards and there are people who still

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,590
read paper and print media so just try

00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:07,590
to think outside the box and reach out

00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:10,279
beyond the easy easy usual suspects

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,279
kinds of things

00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,660
and going along with that build a

00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,320
network with community organizations and

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,509
organizations outside of technology

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,730
reach out to community colleges and

00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:24,230
places where people who are trying to

00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,970
come into technology through a

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,120
non-traditional path may be coming from

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:31,610
and they there are people out there who

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,889
have grant money who have a stated goal

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,480
to get people into tach and there's kind

00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:37,730
of a there can be kind of a disconnect

00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,320
between the tech community and people in

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,330
traditional education who are trying to

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,860
get people into technology so finding

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:45,070
ways to bridge that gap is really

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,070
helpful

00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:52,390
and last but not least studies have

00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,160
shown I don't have the citation for the

00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,280
exact study but I know that a study was

00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,050
done that if you invite somebody to come

00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,550
back or to come participate in your

00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:03,070
event they're more likely to come and do

00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:06,220
it go figure I know that I personally

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,810
have attended events in the past where I

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,550
may have felt a little out of place but

00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,080
when somebody from leadership reached

00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,790
out to me and said hey we noticed you

00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,100
were there and we were happy to see you

00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:17,350
we'd like to see you come back then I

00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,660
thought oh okay well I belong here I can

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,870
come back it seems really simple but it

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,870
works

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,830
and I'm running a little early so that's

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,870
good we'll get some time back girl

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,840
develop it we have a booth downstairs

00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:34,610
we'd love to chat about this stuff you

00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,770
can find us on Twitter you can email the

00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:39,620
leaders at rdu at girl develop it calm

00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,750
and we run all our events on meetup so

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,280
if you want to get a list of classes and

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:46,510
events that we have coming up find us on

00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,510
meetup thank you

00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:55,310
thank you

00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:59,570
thank you Sarah all right moving along

00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:01,760
our next speaker is from Penn Manor

00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:04,070
sorry brain cramp Penn Manor Charlie

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,300
Risinger is going to talk about rewiring

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,300
generation Z

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,570
thank you all right let's see how my

00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:19,640
karma is today with the clicker OOP

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:21,140
slides oh there we go cool okay great so

00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,780
ladies and gentlemen I need to bust a

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,970
myth about students these days it's the

00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,309
myth that generation Z it's that

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,919
generation after the Millennials it's

00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:33,289
the myth that they're digital natives

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,720
that these kids somehow have these great

00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:38,240
computing skills directly wired into

00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,570
their synapses from birth

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,870
here's the truth though for all of the

00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,890
time that these kids spend on technology

00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:48,110
they're really not that great of

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,660
computers

00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,880
and it's strange though because there's

00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,799
this wildly popular digital native myth

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,860
right these get these kids are glued to

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,780
their gadgets 24-7 and all that social

00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,549
media and that gaming skill must be

00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:04,309
translating into great computer skills

00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:06,710
right but the truth is is that as their

00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:10,010
devices become more simplified and in

00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,690
many ways sealed our kids are becoming

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,549
further and further disconnected from

00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,960
understanding the art and the science of

00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:17,630
computing

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,029
now I've watched their skills disappear

00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:22,399
for the past several years

00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:24,559
but it really struck me this past August

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,379
when I was working with a group of

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,090
incoming 7th graders digital natives who

00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:31,099
were having trouble figuring out how to

00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:33,979
take a file and save it into their home

00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:36,139
directory some of them had no concept of

00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:39,019
what a file type was and a few of them

00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:41,809
were having trouble with closing and

00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:43,759
opening windows now unfortunately these

00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:45,229
low technology skills are not just

00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:46,879
unique to my school district the

00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:49,309
research is telling us that across the

00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:51,799
country kids are losing their computer

00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:55,099
skills and school board practices

00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:57,830
amplify this problem as schools are

00:32:55,099 --> 00:33:00,469
purchasing tablets instead of computers

00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,509
and simultaneously cutting the budget

00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:04,879
for elective computer science and

00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:07,399
technology classes we're left with a

00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:09,259
generation that is a tablet and screen

00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:10,789
tapping generation that is never

00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:13,070
learning to unlock the true power of

00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:14,599
technology so I think we need to do

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,219
better for our kids and here's how we're

00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:17,820
changing that story at Penn Manor School

00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:20,130
District

00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:23,970
we've launched a unique one-to-one

00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:26,790
laptop computer program every kid in

00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:28,380
grade 7 through 12 receives a laptop

00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:31,230
loaded with linux and open source

00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,970
software exclusively and our kids are

00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:37,560
trusted with root access on those

00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:39,540
laptops that's 2,500 kids unpowered with

00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,240
an unrestrained and unlocked full

00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,920
computing device

00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,420
now these laptops are daily

00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,340
instructional companions in the

00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,590
classroom but with that trust and that

00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:51,280
openness we're finding their learning is

00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:53,710
exploding in ways we never expected

00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,990
for example when we first rolled out the

00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,850
program our kids immediately took to

00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:00,580
figuring out how to get spotify running

00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:04,240
and netflix playing inside linux now two

00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,610
years ago you know this wasn't so easily

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,560
done right it was the first time that

00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:10,030
many of our kids had to get down and

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,800
gritty with the command line and figure

00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,990
out how to get netflix working there's

00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,940
no app install they had to take a little

00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:17,619
expedition into a terminal for the first

00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,450
time

00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:21,700
and we're seeing all kinds of little

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:23,440
surprises for example kids experimenting

00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,329
with alternative desktop environments

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,470
which is really cool to see but there's

00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,849
something else really cool that's

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,950
happening that people didn't expect

00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:32,130
we've had zero discipline issues with

00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:34,470
giving our kids root access

00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:37,050
to support this entire project we've

00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:40,320
created a unique helpdesk program this

00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:41,730
is a high school course we're 21 student

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,330
apprentices are working side by side

00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:47,580
with my IT team and I these kids are

00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:50,640
providing peer support for their fellow

00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,140
students there resolving tickets they're

00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,550
writing documentation they're getting

00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:56,550
out in the classrooms and providing

00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,920
training they're building excellent IT

00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,570
skills but more importantly they're

00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,710
learning how to build a community of

00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:06,410
tech support for their peers

00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:09,140
and there's one other key factor in this

00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:11,630
program we don't exclude students based

00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,339
on their Rockstar technology skills this

00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,240
course is open to every student no

00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:17,030
matter their level of technical

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,300
expertise the course prerequisite for

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,250
our helpdesk is curiosity

00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,430
now again many of the digital natives

00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,750
are finding they can do this and for

00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,370
many of them it's the first time that

00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,950
they've ever thrown together a shell

00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:32,210
script or replace the logic board for

00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,890
some of them it's the first time they

00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,130
ever held a side or a soldering iron in

00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,650
their hand

00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,509
and I think it's these first moments

00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,299
these first learning moments that to me

00:35:39,509 --> 00:35:44,609
are so magical and so transformative for

00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:46,500
our kids I love to watch when a student

00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,630
realizes for the first time that she can

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,940
use technology to do her bidding that

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:54,380
she can control the technology she can

00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,380
use it to rewire her universe

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,500
but I think there's a question that we

00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,730
need to wrestle with and school boards

00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,340
and schools need to wrestle with and

00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,660
it's very simple and that question is

00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:06,900
which side of the command line should

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:09,210
our kids be on do we pre wire the

00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,850
learning environments and ask our kids

00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:15,120
to learn inside a sandbox or do we

00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:18,150
embrace open and give our kill earnest

00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:21,740
our kids the skills to rewire and change

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,740
the universe thank you

00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,740
thanks charlie I always loved listening

00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,710
to him speak sorry about the brain cramp

00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:40,200
earlier so our last speaker is the

00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:43,609
inestimable Joe no bacon Joe no come on

00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,609
up and talk about hacking humans

00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:54,470
hello everyone I'm terrified about

00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:58,220
getting through this in five minutes so

00:36:54,470 --> 00:37:00,780
I'm going to be a bit quick all right so

00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,820
as many of you know I'm very passionate

00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,950
about this community and figuring out

00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,270
how we can build strong inclusive

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:08,220
effective communities that build really

00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,600
cool things one of the things I've

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,020
learned over the time is that it's

00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,460
really complicated and it's a mixture of

00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,290
people and process and technology and

00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,690
all this kind of stuff a while they got

00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,010
my best friend this guy called Stewart

00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,560
language who lives in England was

00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,600
visiting my wife and I in California and

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,700
he showed me a TED talk by this guy is

00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,230
called Rory Sutherland he is the most

00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,720
English person on the internet you will

00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,730
ever see he basically works in

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,140
advertising and he talks about

00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,700
behavioral economics Jim white hers

00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:40,020
talked about this the other day and this

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:41,580
is essentially the the science of how we

00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,650
study irrational people and how they

00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,420
behave the problem with economists is

00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,340
that they believe that everything can be

00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,780
put into a spreadsheet and that's not

00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,820
the way we tend to work as human beings

00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,920
so behavioral economics is essentially

00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,750
how do people really work how do they

00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,690
how do they think and how do we study

00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,010
that so

00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,390
I thought this was really interesting

00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,670
because it effectively provides a

00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,720
scaffold in a science backed scaffolding

00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,970
for how we can actually build

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,200
communities instead of the kind of

00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,369
figure it out and try to figure out best

00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,800
practice that I've been doing for the

00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:11,650
most of my career so what's interesting

00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,200
here is that we've all got one of these

00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:16,640
varying sizes and different people and

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,530
within our brain we have two types of

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,780
thinking and the first type is called

00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,819
system one this is basically immediate

00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,550
gut reaction to something 1+1 2

00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:27,890
immediate system to thinking is

00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,210
essentially more thought-out processes

00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,859
so if you're going to buy a car what's

00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,290
going to be the right balance of

00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:35,660
features and and and lifetime and all

00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:38,300
the rest of it and what's interesting is

00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:41,630
that system to is kind of like the press

00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,819
office for system one it's the we often

00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,460
react just immediately to various things

00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:47,780
and within system one and behavioral

00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,910
economics is figuring out how we

00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,560
naturally react to things and then using

00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:54,260
that as a means to make based decisions

00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,339
so within behavioral economics I believe

00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,079
there's basically three things you want

00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:58,550
to do the first thing is understand a

00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:59,990
rationality and there's actually a lot

00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,810
of common things that we do when we're

00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:04,400
at as a rational human beings so what

00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:06,410
are the things that we tend to do how do

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,420
we how do we react to various stimulus

00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,800
the second thing is behavioral economics

00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,480
is fundamentally about building a choice

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,790
architecture it's saying i want to get

00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,200
from here to here and you might want to

00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,520
give people a bunch of different options

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,349
that all will get to essentially the

00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,640
same point and then what we do is we

00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:22,400
build interfaces tools and processes

00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,410
that in that essentially build that

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,490
choice architecture that helps

00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,500
irrational people to get into the right

00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,670
direction the problem with this is with

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,230
behavioral economics is that it's

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,609
fascinating but it's very difficult to

00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:35,510
figure out how to actually apply it to

00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:37,550
real things so i discovered this guy dr.

00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,230
david rock he's a brain scientist and

00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,760
he's done a bunch of experiments with

00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,890
animals and he came up with something

00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,630
called the scarf model which are five

00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,190
really practical things that you can do

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,780
to actually

00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,190
bring behavioral economics into

00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,320
community so I'm going to quickly run

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,240
through this he actually published a

00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,910
full report in this that's pretty heavy

00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,950
but it's really interesting first thing

00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,780
is status this is all system one

00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:02,390
thinking as human beings we really care

00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:05,390
about status we care about about our

00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:07,670
position in the group and any ambiguity

00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,320
in terms of status is unsettling for us

00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,700
so helping people to really understand

00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,100
where they fit we often see this with

00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,940
developers and committers and

00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,230
recognizing people were actually part of

00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,630
a community as opposed to people who are

00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:20,090
just fans of a community to clarify that

00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,880
relative importance the second piece is

00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:26,240
certainty system one thinking gets

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,350
freaked out by insecurity and things

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,910
that aren't particularly predictable

00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:31,280
this is why when there's big significant

00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:33,290
changes at work the company gets kind of

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,850
weirded out by things so we have to plan

00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,230
for certainty and actively make sure

00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,820
that people don't have that level the

00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:42,160
level of ambiguity the third thing

00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,770
is autonomy and this is about choice

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,990
architecture as human beings we

00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:49,060
inherently like choice when we when we

00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,740
feel like our choices are removed so

00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,940
imagine you join a company you don't

00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,560
really have a lot of input in the

00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,050
direction of the company we find that

00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,170
frustrating so we need to put choices in

00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:01,030
place and build that choice architecture

00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:03,430
but also we can structure that like I

00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:05,380
say so you can get predictable outcomes

00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,300
out of that so even if all three choices

00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,070
get you to the position you want that

00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,440
person to be in make sure you provide

00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,390
them with choices the other thing is

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,710
relatedness is that social groupings are

00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,290
really important and this is all about

00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,820
scope so there's a lot of people in this

00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,650
room and we kind of divided up into

00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,780
little different groups some people with

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,490
different projects or whatever else and

00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,930
that relatedness is important for not

00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,490
going to getting to know people but also

00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:30,280
making people feel part of something

00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:31,630
that's that's bigger than them and what

00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,200
was really interesting was the final one

00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:37,210
fairness dr. Rock did some interesting

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,040
experiments with monkeys that identified

00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:41,080
that not only do we want fairness for us

00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,510
every one of us in this room wants to be

00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:46,030
treated fairly but we also want fairness

00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:48,220
for other people as well so when you see

00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:50,920
acts of unfairness we find that

00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,260
frustrating so that's the scarf model I

00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,470
encourage you to go and check it out

00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,470
thank you very much

00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,839
Thank You Jana well that brings us to

00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:07,940
the end of the lightning talks and I

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,130
just I observe I thought about something

00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,619
when we were wrapping up I love the fact

00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,180
that at these sessions it's it's all

00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:15,710
about I want to talk to you about how to

00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,690
be helpful and how to be of service and

00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,609
how to make people more successful I am
