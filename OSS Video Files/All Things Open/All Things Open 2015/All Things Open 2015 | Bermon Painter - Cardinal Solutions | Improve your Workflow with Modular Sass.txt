SAS logo right like if you were to say I

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,399
designed it didn't that awesome it is

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,199
for me ya know so I had a anybody ever

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,879

black-bearded st. Nick like really nice

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,659
really kind a lot of fun to hang out

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,030
with so wait I guess two or three years

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,700
ago now they put out an open call to see

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,000
who wanted to contribute to redesigning

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,170
the SAS brand so I raised my hand so I

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,570
get to work with with Mike who's

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,409
phenomenal and Gina Bolton who was great

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,119
from Salesforce doing really great stuff

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,869
got to work with with rebranding the

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,799
whole site I got to design the logo

00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,710
totally don't do that very much

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,009
especially script type logos not my

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,229
thing the the earlier iterations or up

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,630
on dribbble they look horrible because

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,610
I've never done script X before so yeah

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,860
that's what it turned out as so SAS logo

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,350
in charlotte i organized a handful of

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,530
local events one for front-end one for

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,200
you x and the now-dead blend conference

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,540
that i used to put on it has seen its

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,360
last conference so that's over and then

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,190
I work for calling the solutions we're

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,810
based out of Cincinnati we have an

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,500
office here like between raleigh and

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,880
durham

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,440
I'm not sure which one they actually

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,890
claim i think the address is technically

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,170
rally but it's like right smack dab in

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,800
the middle of both cities so you can go

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:29,940
to either and then I manage UX practice

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,650
so in anything UX design front end falls

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,260
under practice and we're hiring so if

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,520
you do design or you do front end or you

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,770
do you x stuff you can tell you chat

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,440
with me and we can see what you'd like

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,540
to do and you can find me online at

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,630
Berman painter that's Twitter Skype

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,040
gmail whatever if you have any sass

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,810
questions you can totally just skype me

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,140
or email me your hit me up on Twitter

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,410
and we can chat about it so today we're

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,630
going to talk about modular sass and I'm

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,840
going to share a handful of thoughts

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:04,080
around sass in general and talk about

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,320
ways that we can create modular SAS code

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,560
and then I'll go in and show you some

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,140
examples from a past project that we had

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,230
done so you can see some real life stuff

00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:19,110
now the the whole point of this is to

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:21,660
take the the typical mindset that we've

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,790
had doing front-end development make a

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,830
few slight adjustments now added

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,430
curiosity who's been doing front end for

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,280
more than ten years okay a few folks

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,250
back in the good old days of ftp before

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,680
preprocessors and you just created a CSS

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,170
file and wrote what little was supported

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,220
back then and if he peeped it up to a

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,019
server so morning they just magically

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,870
worked you did it all in production all

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:49,350
the time basically and it's changed a

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:55,769
little bit who's been doing it for less

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:57,780
than five okay less than two like less

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,989
than one like just getting started okay

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,640
cool so it's changed a lot and there's a

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,280
lot of things that you kind of have to

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,900
do when you're getting things that I was

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,870
just talking to the folks at the GTI

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,880
booth earlier about like how it's not

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,079
it's not as easy because they're a bunch

00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,959
of different things that you have to

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,280
kind of know about tangentially like you

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,790
have to know version control and you

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,070
have a little bit about node

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,530
and package managers and all these other

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,790
things just so you can get some project

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,100
setup which is kind of ridiculous but

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,080
that's kind of the way it's gone but the

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,690
whole purpose of what we're trying to do

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,940
and kind of why the industry has gone

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,580
the way that it has is that we're trying

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,130
to build this more modular mindset we're

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:44,710
thinking of things into smaller

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:47,200
components so in in SAS we're taking

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,320
these smaller objects trying to make

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:56,020
them dry and responsive and importantly

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:58,990
make them also accessible so this is a

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,120
quote that alive from Steven hey Brad

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:04,870
frost also talks about this a good bit

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,530
is you know ten years ago a designer

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,610
would get a Photoshop comp and give that

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,230
over to the front end folks for the

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,050
developers and they would kind of go

00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,430
from the top left and code that up into

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,130
a design right so that they would either

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,620
on page to page basis and get whatever

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,570
system that they were creating so the

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,210
point now are the focus now is that

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,310
we're trying to think of things in much

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,690
smaller chunks oh here's this piece of

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,210
code that does this thing that I can

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,680
reuse in a number of areas and then we

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,750
use a bunch of those smaller pieces to

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,730
build pages so that's the overall idea

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,830
of of the thought of where things are

00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,720
going now over the past number of years

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,150
that there have been a handful of ideas

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,980
or concepts around how we ride our

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,600
front-end code these are three of

00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,450
probably the most the more popular I

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,930
kind of dig all of them to a certain

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,730
degree so one thing to keep in mind is

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,860
that you don't have to just choose one

00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,770
so let's talk through those real quick

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,160
and kind of contrast to compare what

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,290
they are and how they work so that the

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,600
first one came about from Nicole

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,700
Sullivan she is a phenomenal front-end

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,760
developer does a lottery at work did

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,950
some great work for facebook has done

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,920
some amazing stuff around these concepts

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:21,670
so she kind of coined the term of OCS s

00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:25,390
which stands for object-oriented CSS now

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:28,480
it's a methodology where you're trying

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,390
to write these reusable pieces of CSS

00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,400
that's fast and scalable hopefully

00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,710
maintainable

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,930
so you're thinking of your CSS as

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,960
objects basically so objects in this

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,030
case are basically HTML so you have

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,350
these HTML objects and you're stalling

00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:47,130
them and doing what you need to do with

00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:49,710
CSS now one of the or the concepts that

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,320
she has is this level of abstraction

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,389
where you're attracting structure from

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,000
looking film right so your structural

00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:59,669
CSF that lays it out like it should be

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,419
from the CSS that makes it look like

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:05,699
what it's supposed to look like so

00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:08,120
things like positioning or

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,970
presentational styles that would be like

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,590
background colors colors watercolors

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:16,560
imagery background images that they give

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:19,500
something a look and feel the the second

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,470
concept is you're separating your

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,889
container from the content which i think

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,990
is a pretty important principle so any

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,150
object that you create right any HTML

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,120
object you create should be able to be

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,770
placed in another container and still

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,099
look and function like it was intended

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:40,979
originally so that's what she's trying

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:42,510
to do now that this is a pretty common

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,210
example right this is an accordion an

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:48,000
accordion typically has some type of

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,639
title and then some type of control and

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,949
then that title in control have some

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,930
relation to the content right like the

00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,780
accordion pain if you want to call it

00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,610
that so you click the plus sign or click

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,760
the arrows or you click on the title and

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:06,630
it expands and contracts the pain right

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:10,530
the accordion pain now if I was writing

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,970
this in object-oriented CSS it might

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,400
look something kind of like that right

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,810
so I'm calling my accordion and

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,169
accordion right that totally makes sense

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,940
we're going to call it that and then the

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,060
accordion has a title and has a content

00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:26,090
pane content goes in there and then I

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,949
might have some type of action somewhere

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:31,289
now this is kind of where we're

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:35,430
separating looking feel right so we have

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:37,349
the overall structural CSS that makes

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,539
our accordion layout like it should and

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:40,650
then we have a couple of the classes

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,250
that are kind of weird we have box

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:47,940
border and we have separator border

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,110
which gives us the borders while the

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,330
border on the Box you really can't see

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,610
on on on this screen but then the

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,860
separating borders there so it's

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,180
specific to this implementation and the

00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,880
only thing to do is they've they add

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,440
borders now I might want to add borders

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,640
on things that aren't just an accordion

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,310
and that's quite a nice set up that way

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,560
so that's kinda what we have enough

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,640
writing CSS for that you might have with

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,080
something kind of similar so we're just

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,390
using basic descendant selectors to set

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,670
up our accordion and then the title and

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:21,090
the content in relation to the accordion

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,350
and then we have our are two border

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,200
classes that are kind of sitting by

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:27,450
themselves at the root level if you want

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,370
to call it that in our CSS that we can

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,470
reuse anywhere and we know that one of

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,330
them is going to give a border around

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,880
any type of element and the other is

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:40,110
going to add kind of a bottom border so

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:43,260
we have some separator the next concept

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,180
who is my personal favorite from from

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,340
Jonathan snook the friendly Canadian

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,630
used to work at Shopify oh no did it

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:54,839
crash it totally did something weird

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:57,390
there we go yeah so Jonathan snook

00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,790
Johnson snook Easter or yahoo were for

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,680
shop aha Shopify and had some really

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:05,970
great concepts around front-end

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,040
development so his goal behind this

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,890
concept of smacks which is scalable

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:18,710
modular architecture for CSS is to

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:22,650
identify repeating patterns Microsoft

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:26,339
silly Microsoft let's try that again

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:29,700
okay so he's trying to identify those

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,050
patterns and cut those into these flakes

00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,860
were usable module you can use over and

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,780
over again so if like front in is your

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,970
thing and you really enjoy it you should

00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,980
totally read that book it is great it's

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,839
short you can read it in a weekend or

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,490
the drive back home but not while

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,390
driving hopeful 20 else is driving for

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:52,320
you he has most of it online for free

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:55,770
there are some sass bits that are kind

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,960
of behind the purchase so it's great he

00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,240
also does a workshop around this

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,120
totally worthwhile I believe you can buy

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,070
some of that online it's recorded so

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,590
great read now this is the way that he

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,370
kind of separates things out so he has

00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:14,970
this idea of base level CSS so this is

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,640
where all of the base styles live any

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,530
resets element defaults so like your

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,530
your H once or 86 is your paragraphs

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,590
your lists they all live in our base our

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:29,010
default font sizes all that good stuff

00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:31,650
and this this directory is primarily

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,240
primarily full of your base level

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,730
elements anything that's not a class or

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,960
an ID or an attribute just your base

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:43,440
helmets they live there the next one is

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,720
layout so in this directory you would

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,010
typically try and specify all the types

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,110
of layout containers that might exist

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:53,460
like headers footers content sidebars

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,680
the layout elements are only have any

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,510
Styles applied to them they only to

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
divide the websites into sections right

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,290
so like grid systems and things like

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,230
that will live in your layout and let's

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,960
see we also have modules now the the

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:08,670
bulk of your CSS is probably going to go

00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,560
in the module directory right this raw

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,720
the magic happens all the really nifty

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,900
things that you do would be here in

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,290
modules are in sub modules now every

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,520
module should be independent of its

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,160
context so I should be able to take a

00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,630
module and put it anywhere inside of the

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,520
application website that I'm creating

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,320
and it should work with and whatever

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,620
layout or container I put it in right

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,210
that's the goal and then one thing that

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,880
he does that I really really like is

00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,350
this separation of states so if you're

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,640
building these engaging websites for

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,860
applications you're going to have a

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,890
state things want to be open or closed

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,490
or visible or invisible so he uses a

00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:51,690
state's directive to place these there

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:53,550
and it's great the the final one is this

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,900
concept of theme so it's similar top

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,450
Tori and CSS for your separating

00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,420
structure from looking feel he does the

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,180
same thing here and I really like that

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:06,390
this I believe it anybody use bootstrap

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,740
you love bootstrap a lot I kind of hate

00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,110
it it's good like it's a really good

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,550
framework but it's so painful sometimes

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,100
to try and

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,800
theme and have bootstrap sites and not

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,880
look like bootstrap this kind of thought

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,560
they're trying to move this direction

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,170
right but this is kind of the problem

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:27,540
where it was so nice to just have

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,490
structural CSS that has no theme things

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,560
apply so I can just go through and

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,180
create a theme file a theme file and

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,740
just style things I haven't over I

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,690
things everywhere that would be so

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,760
amazing so that's kind of where this

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,990
concept comes from right because you

00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,850
want to be able to create these these

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,940
modules like an accordion xin accordion

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,019
the the HTML structure and the

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,399
javascript and the structural CSS

00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,740
doesn't really change from site to site

00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,630
but the way it looks might change a

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,730
little bit so it's nice to be able to

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:57,029
have that live on a per side basis or

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,440
have like a bootstrap theme and I can

00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:01,079
make it look like bootstrap or I can do

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:06,510
something totally different and that's

00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:09,149
the goal so the goal then is to take

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,850
something like the accordion and we

00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:16,260
break those components down into kind of

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:18,480
their smallest dependency and to try and

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,510
never mimic the overall like we don't

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,089
want to do write CSS it looks like to

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,060
writing HTML and CSS is kind of weird so

00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:28,950
if I was going to write HTML for that I

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,990
might do something kind of like this so

00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,070
again i'm going to create an accordion

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,839
class because it's kind of the parent

00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,329
i'm going to name space suit accordion

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,459
and then i might have an accordion title

00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:40,920
and accordion content and then there's

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:43,320
really only a couple states or a state

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,279
that i'm going to toggle the accordion

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:50,339
is either active or inactive so if the

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,380
titles act of my my plus sign is going

00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:55,440
to change the minus sign or vice versa

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,300
and i might do a different visual for

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,630
the title and then if my content

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,930
container is active it's going to appear

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:06,029
if it's inactive is going to shut right

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,310
so he's managing state that way which i

00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:09,449
think is great now if i'm writing CSS

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,930
it's going to look pretty similar to the

00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:14,310
outdoor eNOS the SS version right now in

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,990
this case you'll notice that I'm just

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,680
doing accordion accordion title

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,029
accordion content I'm not doing any any

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,890
descendant selector so everything's at

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:24,199
the root level lowest part which is

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,389
pretty good

00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:31,050
John long here in Raleigh that works at

00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:32,879
uservoice here the pushes is a lot like

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,579
on the South what the SAS wife which is

00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:39,079
a fantastic SAS blog that has lots of

00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:42,329
examples of great stuff I've been like

00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:43,860
trying to wrap my brain around feeling

00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:46,589
comfortable just doing everything at the

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,750
root level and not doing any nested

00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:50,220
selectors at all once you used to it as

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,579
nice because then you hardly ever have

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,949
to the fifth specificity which is great

00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:58,230
and then the third one so this is the T

00:15:55,949 --> 00:16:01,709
me and X they created this concept

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:05,850
called BIM now BIM stands for blog

00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:09,300
element and modifier now the blocks now

00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:11,430
blancs our top level abstractions of a

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,560
new component basically the pair of the

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,360
parent of what we're creating and we'll

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,970
show you an example in a second the

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,029
element or any child items or child

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:25,350
elements that can be placed inside the

00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:28,559
block and then we have a modifier so

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,470
modifiers manipulate the blocks so that

00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,389
we can theme or style / to your opponent

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:38,009
or do something completely unrelated to

00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:41,430
the core CSS for the module itself so

00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:45,389
again we have the accordion visually it

00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:47,550
doesn't change at all but if we're

00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:49,470
writing the HTML for that we might end

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,750
up with something like this so we have

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,809
our block which we've called accordion

00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:57,059
which is our parent level class we have

00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:59,639
accordion title and accordion content

00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,559
now if you write CSS a lot that might

00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,650
look a little bit weird it has 200

00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:09,270
scores that in BIM 200 scores is what

00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,829
denotes an element level element which

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,929
is kind of weird but that's the element

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:17,159
right so that that's the child of the

00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:19,919
other block so that's how it looks I

00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:21,600
still don't like it too much but it's

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,240
useful and I'll explain why in a second

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,659
and then we have our state or a modifier

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,000
right so modifiers in BIM are denoted

00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:30,990
with with two hyphens I think I like

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,820
kinda looks weird cuz you're missing

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,100
underscores and hyphens and you can get

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,030
super crazy on how you're modifying

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,450
things

00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:41,130
but this is the benefit like if you're

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,470
the sole developer on a project like

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,450
this is just your portfolio site you can

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,860
tell to use it's not a big deal you can

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,130
use whatever lil you feel like using it

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:54,090
but if you're working on a team of you

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:57,780
know 50 60 120 developers it is super

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,010
useful I'm not one on conformity but in

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,570
this case this is probably where I'm ok

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,530
with conforming right conforming the

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,500
standards and kind of doing everything

00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:08,280
the same because it means you're writing

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,040
the same type of CSS now what that

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,520
allows me to do is if I go in to look at

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:18,660
somebody else's code I know what a

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:20,730
block-level classy is versus a modifier

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,960
versus an element and I can see where

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,140
they're kind of intertwined or

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,970
integrated right so it's easier to read

00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,230
it just kind of weird if you're just now

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,530
adjusting to looking at a bunch of

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,750
underscores and double hyphens so if I'm

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:37,290
writing my CSS it might look something

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,390
kind of like that now again I'm keeping

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,280
things at a root level so I don't I

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:45,720
paragraph specificity as much in the

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,300
future now which is pretty nice so the

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,040
whole idea i think is like we have all

00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,870
of these methodologies and ideas and

00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,090
these aren't the only three that there's

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,940
a handful out there that constantly

00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,620
change and if you're right that n is

00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,450
totally for grins because i had a nice

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,930
much from all together you get something

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:06,510
weird so I don't know I kind of like

00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,880
using concepts from all of them where it

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,750
makes sense or I guess depending on what

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,790
side of the better woke up that day

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,860
because they totally depends right I

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,300
mean write CSS and enjoy riding it but

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,790
you know tinker with stuff and see how

00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,620
you like it now when when I'm writing

00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,440
modules these are my own personal

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,990
requirements what I what my expectations

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,880
are for myself and for our team on how

00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,890
we do things and some of them kind of

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,120
take the three concepts we just

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,950
discussed and like squish them all

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,700
together into something that makes sense

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,350
for what we do so one is any module we

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,540
create should be nested right that's so

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,970
this concept of being able to live on

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,340
its own live outside of context or any

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:49,790
other context without totally exploding

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,790
it should work for a rice ticket to

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,269
I should be able to take a module and

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,950
another module and kind of squish them

00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:58,440
together and they should still work

00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,110
right so I should be able to to combine

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:05,220
things together to create bigger badder

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:10,429
better modules in some way three anybody

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,429
mess with flexbox at all do you love it

00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:17,070
yeah that was like a half-hearted yeah

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:19,649
yeah kind of i'm in i'm in the same boat

00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,350
i got i totally dig the concept i think

00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:23,580
it's glorious and when it works is great

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,340
but is it a little more to wrap your

00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,220
head around in miami it's low from

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,899
Alabama but now so it's the more to wrap

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,130
your head around it's not as easy as

00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:35,549
floats but it's supposed to be easier

00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:37,260
than floats but I dig it if you haven't

00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:39,539
messed with flexbox it really is great

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,010
because it gets really smart and it

00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:45,240
automates some of those layout

00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,889
annoyances that exist sometimes but then

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,559
every browser supports this flick not

00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:50,940
every browser supports flexbox yet so we

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:54,360
still have to use floats which means

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,059
that we still have to clear fix so clear

00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,490
freaks basically help with floating

00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:00,929
layout issues if you don't know what

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,590
that means talk to me after and we can

00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:06,899
chat a bit it's super simple for or

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:10,019
sponsor is the thing so although modules

00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:11,940
need to be independently flexible they

00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,620
should ebb and flow with the web because

00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,860
that's the point of the web it kind of

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,809
moves a little bit and we have more

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,190
device sizes that I can care to keep up

00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:22,440
with now so I just don't care so just

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:25,320
just make it flow a bit and it should

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,669
work out fine and then fifth is kind of

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:31,470
the concept from smacks and a no CSS

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:34,049
which is the separating our structure

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:37,019
from our theme so from a module level we

00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:39,049
actually have two versions of each

00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:41,940
module one is the structure and the

00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:43,620
other one is the specific skin for

00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,639
whatever site or application that we're

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:50,010
working on the last but not least is

00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,480
accessibility right any module that we

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,139
create anything you put on the web

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,139
should be accessible

00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,010
not just for folks that have

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,380
disabilities but that's just be the

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:05,550
general thumb anything we create should

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:08,310
be accessible okay so this is kind of

00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:11,640
this is how aren't my CSS and it's

00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:16,440
similar to some of the other stuff so I

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,440
still have an accordion as as my parent

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,390
on my block if you want to call it that

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,040
and then everything's namespace oh I

00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:26,550
have my title and my content which is

00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,830
totally fine I haven't quite sold myself

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,720
enough on BIM we have some developers

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,830
that absolutely love it it's just super

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,940
weird for me still which is probably

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:38,070
ridiculous but it is I'm trying to make

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,590
myself use it a bit more and then

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,870
instead of using classes to manage state

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:46,280
which kind of feels icky because it's

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:48,270
more those types of classes are tied to

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,460
JavaScript more they are look and feel

00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:54,000
and so I prefer to use data attributes

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,550
in html5 to manage my state so in this

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,530
case I have a state for the title and

00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:00,660
estate for the content and they're open

00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,560
or closed you call active and active

00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,750
whatever you wanted to call it that

00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,840
that's a much better hook for for

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,210
JavaScript so in my case when i'm

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,610
looking at my my HTML and i see a dead

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,140
attribute i know there's probably some

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:17,340
javascript is tying into that somewhere

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:19,830
and if i use angular at all yeah like

00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,380
data attributes everywhere they use that

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:26,130
all over the place which is great to a

00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,170
degree I think from running my CSS might

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,940
have something kind of like this data

00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,730
state i'm just using an attribute

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:37,020
selector for my CSS for open and closed

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:39,240
and that works pretty well now let's

00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:42,600
turn that into sass now if i'm using SAS

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,100
this is a sassy syntax I really kind of

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,190
like this a syntax which means like

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,290
there's no semicolons and curly braces

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,570
just easier to read for me but it's kind

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:53,340
of evil so in this case this is a sassy

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:57,450
sentai so it looks like CSS it's just

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,220
nested now what you'll see there is we

00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,870
have an accordion but I'm not doing

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,210
accordion title and accordion content

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,950
i'm using an ampersand now the ampersand

00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,680
is something they call a reference

00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,800
select or a parent selector

00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,690
and what that's doing is it's looking at

00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,570
the nearest parent and it's going to

00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:17,540
spit that into the ampersand so when I

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:20,480
when I turn that into CSS I really gonna

00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:23,210
get something like that so it's going to

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,730
take those nested nested elements and

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,490
still spit those out at a root level but

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:33,160
use the correct name spacing so that's a

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:38,780
great way to structure your your CSS or

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:43,370
your sass to get good stuff now in the

00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:46,310
the previous example we had just like

00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,380
the basic accordion right look something

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:51,290
like that now the challenge with that is

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,800
i'm using a screen reader screener is

00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:56,990
going to have any idea what's going on

00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,490
it's not going to tag very well into the

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,130
title or to the content there's no

00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,600
relation really between the two it's not

00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,690
going to know what's enabled and once

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,240
disabled so we need to add a few

00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:13,010
niceties to make that work pretty well

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:18,350
so n html5 the the spec is called Aria a

00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:21,410
RI a and it has so many nice things that

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:24,230
you can use to make your HTML so much

00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:26,330
more accessible now one thing that

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:29,270
you'll see is on our accordion we've

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:31,730
given it an attribute called roll so

00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:33,760
roll defines the type of module this is

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,780
for a screen reader in this case

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,810
accordions were basically like tabs

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,280
right so you click on a tab and it shows

00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,540
content you click on another tab it

00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,700
hides the other content and you see the

00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,520
content specific to the tab accordions

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:49,810
function the exact same way they're just

00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,310
displayed differently visually so

00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:54,710
there's a role specific to area called

00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,990
tab lists that that allows us to define

00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,070
this as an aria module that functions

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,630
like tabs so you'll see that we have

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,240
three roles specific to this so we have

00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:08,210
our parent role which is our tab list on

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,770
our on our title we have a role called

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,330
tab that means this is the tab this then

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,940
we click on and interact with the show

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:16,460
content somewhere and then for the panel

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,270
now we have a role called tab panel so

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:23,050
that give this relationship between

00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:24,330
the tab itself in the tab panel there

00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:28,030
are a few of the things that we're doing

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:30,400
we've added an idear on each of these so

00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:35,710
that we can use audio controls and are

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:38,350
you labeled by so now we know that the

00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,020
tab controls panel one so you do that

00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,610
for tab one tab to panel one panel to so

00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:46,570
they're related together and you the

00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:48,400
converse of that in your in your panel

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,710
so you're saying that this panel is

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,080
labeled by tab one so it kind of is like

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,780
a lua redundant but links the two

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:59,010
together so the content correlates and

00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:01,990
then instead of using data attributes

00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,670
there are attributes an area that allow

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,490
us do similar things right that has

00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:09,430
semantic meaning so one is aria selected

00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:12,130
and re-expanded and then we have our a

00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,300
hidden so those allow us to manage state

00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,190
you can just hook into those with

00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,470
JavaScript little open and close things

00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,420
and change that and then when you change

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,650
that that alerts the screen reader so

00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,390
they know what's going on so they can

00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:24,910
tab through and interact with your

00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:27,430
JavaScript control module and get

00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,780
feedback around what they're doing so

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:33,670
that's one way to make this successful

00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,980
so if I was if I was writing the SAS for

00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:37,270
that it's a little bit more verbose a

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,310
little more to it right because we have

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:42,100
more hooks that we need to adjust and

00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:43,870
toggle and soon up something kind of

00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,460
like that so we have a selected states

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,020
when I'm tabbing through there's some

00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,500
type of visual cue that I've actually

00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:53,260
tabbed into the the title and then

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:57,040
there's is it selected or expanded or

00:27:53,260 --> 00:28:01,270
not right so that's there okay so any

00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:03,760
questions so far about bim or modules or

00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:09,190
SAS that you're just dying to know that

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:10,870
i could answer all right let's go into

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,320
some real examples and kind of show you

00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,320
what's going on

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,080
alrighty

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,690
let me do this

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:39,060
there we go we'll give you that and we

00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,060
give you this

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:49,250
okay so this is a pattern library who's

00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,840
built upon library before their glorious

00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,760
I love them so much there's so much fun

00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,220
to work with we do this now for pretty

00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,430
much every client it's a good hand off

00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,440
for them so they can maintain and manage

00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:02,360
what we set it for before so pen library

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,730
is basically just a whole bunch of

00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,650
clients kind of like stuck together in

00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:10,820
some UI so they can see what you've

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:13,850
built so in this one we have like basic

00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:16,250
headings that show like 18 186 you look

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:18,740
like while the HTML looks like some

00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:21,710
variations of that we have some books

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,300
following like Oh a CSS we have want

00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,160
something that should look like an h1

00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:29,050
but semantically it shouldn't be in h1

00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:32,330
so class is to give them hooks that way

00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,800
and that's that's all in base right so

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,070
there are few things in base like a grid

00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,950
system so they can they can do what they

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:43,370
need to do but again most of magic

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,740
happens down here in modules so we've

00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,960
created a handful of modules for them

00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:50,900
here's an accordion imagine that more

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,640
accordions so what we do from us or our

00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,160
clients because we're typically

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,590
interfacing with fronting teams that may

00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,910
be a little bit anemic may not be super

00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,210
specialized and what they do they may be

00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:04,430
back in developers java.net Ruby in some

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,620
cases they don't quite go out the front

00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,870
end as well as somebody that specializes

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,120
in front end work so we try and give

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,440
them a bit more explanation around why

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,090
to use a pattern and how to use it so

00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,710
they kind of know they don't make silly

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,930
mistakes that some of them to make

00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:19,160
sometimes so we define what the

00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,420
accordion is typically how we're going

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,920
to use it we're going to use it at and

00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,560
then we define how they're actually

00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,880
going to use that and set up in the HTML

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,520
so a typical accordion has a rapper and

00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:33,500
an action at a panel what we're doing to

00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:35,330
manage state and then for JavaScript now

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,360
in this case we're not doing too much

00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,710
are your work it's an internal app

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,799
there's only like a couple thousand

00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:44,110
folks that use it

00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:45,429
and as far as we know there's nobody

00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,570
using a strainer using application

00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:51,850
because it just totally wouldn't work at

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:54,070
all it is it's a this is for a real

00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:57,100
estate brokerage company so lots and

00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,230
lots and lots of forms little painful so

00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,059
you get a live example right that shows

00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,950
functionally how things should look how

00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,869
things should I think should look and

00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,749
how things should work and then we give

00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:09,700
them at HTML example I really enjoy

00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:12,129
using definition lists our description

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,259
list or you going to call those they're

00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:17,950
really great for keyvaluepair type

00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:19,090
things and then we're just managing

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:22,179
state with the data attribute in this

00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:23,739
case so yeah so you have accordions we

00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:26,399
did a custom module we call the page

00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:30,220
which module that was kind of like that

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,230
there's a progress bar that that they

00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,419
can use showing them the various states

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,179
so they know what's going on and this is

00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:39,639
just an ordered list with some classes

00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:43,929
we have alerts right to the other thing

00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:46,419
that showed the various states so a

00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:47,980
message a warning and error success to

00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:49,470
find some JavaScript that I want to use

00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,820
for a bunch of custom JavaScript forum

00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:55,210
this one is just you click on the X and

00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,679
it goes away we have buttons now in this

00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,869
case right we have we have a primary

00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,210
button and this is a donut app sew

00:31:58,869 --> 00:32:04,509
buttons needed to work and be the same

00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:06,580
across buttons links inputs and we gave

00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:08,139
them a small alternative so it's a

00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,720
little more tiny there's a secondary

00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:12,700
button by the same thing and then this

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,559
is the case where we're taking a module

00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,940
or couple modules and combining them

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,129
into a third module color button group

00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,799
this is their typical button pattern

00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:22,480
where we have our primary actions which

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,190
is you're on the right and our secondary

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,989
actions that's you're on the left so

00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,919
they can add as many buttons as they

00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:29,289
want and things will lay out

00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:32,919
appropriately and then we have things

00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:35,259
like this right so this is taking all of

00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,799
these patterns and combining a handful

00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:41,799
in the 101 page to build the page so we

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,499
have our page push at the top we have

00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:46,690
our progress bar here we have all the

00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:49,179
various form things that we did we

00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:52,269
actually build them a fairly robust form

00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:55,110
grid system so you can toggle a class is

00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:57,270
a horizontal horizontal or vertical

00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:01,080
and it'll lay things out accordingly

00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:02,850
like in this case we have horizontal

00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,340
with vertical labels within some other

00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:09,750
stuff in here the horizontal tables and

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:11,760
all that jazz so the the power of this

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,190
approach right what makes this work

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,559
really well is that you've built this

00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:19,470
core set of components that as a team

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,260
and you can maintain on a modular level

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:23,400
so if you have 20 folks working in the

00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,830
same codebase you're not constantly

00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:29,309
squishing each other's code and dealing

00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:31,080
with mergers if using birth control to

00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:34,650
create this page took like half an hour

00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,990
right so we have a rapidly prototype

00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,760
page took in half an hour work with

00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:41,070
production double coat it's pretty good

00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,640
right so we can trade things on the fly

00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:46,559
fairly quickly test out you I flows test

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,780
out beta get that in front of users to

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,040
get feedback and make some adjustments

00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,799
just on the front end before this goes

00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:57,030
to become into the code base which is

00:33:52,799 --> 00:34:00,540
really nice now the code for this which

00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:03,870
is is useful again I think like smacks a

00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:05,070
good bit so we have source here ignore

00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,390
all this other stuff they don't care

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,240
about it for the most part we have an

00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:13,730
assets folder and then within that we

00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,899
have style sheets so we have base now

00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,240
I'm kind of lazy when it comes to using

00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:20,040
base type stuff so these are all of the

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,419
the base level elements that would exist

00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:27,690
Co emphasis fonts font family our grid

00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:30,149
which is their headings in the html5

00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:32,790
type illness that exists and this is

00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:34,679
really just a version of normalize that

00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,250
we just kind of create for every app and

00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:39,210
then we modify specifically so it's

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,850
specific to the app that we're doing so

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,800
we're not overriding things we have

00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:46,109
based their because we're using SAS we

00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,350
have helpers and we have some set of

00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:53,100
stuff so things like functions mix-ins

00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:56,100
utilities and that we might use all of

00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,109
the the magic might really happens here

00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:00,359
in our modules so we look at the

00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:02,220
accordion right here here's the CSS now

00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:03,660
with the exception of my poorly written

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,270
mixing is probably like a couple years

00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,670
old old now there's a there's a color

00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:12,420
here but everything that you see

00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:13,859
here is a strictly structure that

00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,210
there's no look and feel it's just

00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:18,450
laying the according out like it should

00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:21,890
should be laid out now if we if we

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:24,359
scroll down and go to our themes folder

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:26,579
we have a blue theme which is the

00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:29,520
Cardinal theme that we're using I can

00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:31,770
click on the theme version of the CSS

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,599
that's what I get so it's just the

00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,190
classes and look in the fuel that I need

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,770
that specific to the Cardinal theme and

00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,760
now if you're getting super fancy and

00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,849
we're trying to figure out the best way

00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:48,420
to do this is I could go create a new

00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:49,470
theme the yard yard let's do the iron

00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,609
yard we're going to think this look like

00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,490
the iron yard so I could do with him the

00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:56,880
iron yard and it basically takes my my

00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:59,400
theme folder for blue copies that with

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,579
blank values for my colors right ov

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,589
eating super fancy in SAS you can

00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,670
abstract those out in two variables and

00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:07,200
I have to do is change a handful of

00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,849
variable colors and then it changes your

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,040
look and feel for the iron yards which

00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:15,299
is like greys and in some other cool

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,130
color right so all of our modules are

00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:19,380
set up that way so there's a one-to-one

00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,869
correlation between our modules that are

00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:27,359
structural and our modules that are

00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:30,660
theme based and then let's see there's

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,250
here we go so this case we have theme

00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:36,809
specific variables that we're putting in

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:39,119
for our hitting sizes like our fine

00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:41,190
family and we're doing some funky stuff

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,859
with colors but we're using colors here

00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,839
and we reset all those so technically

00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:48,569
all of your color should be stored in

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,980
variables so whenever you're creating a

00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:51,240
new theme you just change your variables

00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,040
for that specific theme and just kind of

00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,230
magically works as long as you're not

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,119
like if you have ten colors it's

00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,670
probably gonna be kind of dicey in most

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,059
cases you have two three maybe four core

00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,990
colors that you use and that's what we

00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:09,150
saw through that for every single module

00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:11,910
and in this case we're setting up some

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,530
some examples that we can use and again

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,290
we're just i'm using slim because i'm

00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:17,700
lazy and it's nice and terse so i'm

00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,339
writing HTML without writing a bunch of

00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,450
brackets and odds and ends it looks like

00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:26,380
it looks like SAS if you use this acid

00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,940
which makes me super happy so we're

00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,130
choosing that we just trade these

00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,720
modules on the fly dump those in copy

00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:34,560
and paste from pattern library and we

00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:39,040
can create pages fairly quickly so

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:47,079
that's what we have that's that's kind

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:51,310
of how it works so closing thoughts well

00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:54,339
you can find this online its built-in

00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,420
middleman so if you dig static site

00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:57,520
generators bill demands kind of my

00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,950
personal favorite it allows you to write

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,349
Ruby type code without actually having

00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,640
to write a bunch of Ruby type code and

00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:05,500
you can spit out a bunch of static sites

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:09,900
fairly quickly is it for all my

00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:12,730
conference sites so it's great it's fast

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,200
all the code and examples are there you

00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,250
can steal or borrow or tink with

00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:20,320
whatever you you find useful and then

00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:22,510
the the most important thing I think is

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,140
there there's just so much out there and

00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:27,790
things change so much I mean they're

00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,819
they're SAS there's less they're styling

00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:33,849
to use stylus out of curiosity I love

00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:37,359
stylus again cuz I'm lazy and it's super

00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:38,800
terse and I don't have to write brackets

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,079
or semicolons or colin's or any that

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,640
nonsense he just like type stuff and it

00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:43,869
just knows what to do what makes it work

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,220
which is great because i suck at typing

00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:49,480
anyway because I'm from Alabama but with

00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,780
all these things less than stylus and

00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,329
sass they're all great technologies

00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:59,470
there's preprocessors those post

00:38:55,329 --> 00:39:01,900
processors just don't be dogmatic right

00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,329
just find what you like enjoy using it

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:07,750
and Chris Quarrier is kind of my

00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:10,869
personal hero he's great run CSS tricks

00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,880
if you reach the SS tricks he's the

00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:15,430
creator of code pin and if you use code

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,940
pin for your code examples the nicest

00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:21,430
person I think you'll ever meet and this

00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,560
is kind of his mantra is like just just

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,420
try pick something do a good job enjoy

00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,680
doing it or don't into it like struggle

00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,690
doing whatever you're trying to do

00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,790
sometimes because that's how coding

00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,460
works but just do it do a good job and

00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,650
that's really all you should expect to

00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,090
yourself

00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:39,270
because there's no reason to be like

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:40,860
super dogmatic about like I love SAS and

00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,920
SAS is the only thing of innovation ever

00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:47,120
used because it's the best I think Chris

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,190
Epstein one of the the curators of SAS

00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,530
call those people's we r which

00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,030
is a pretty good naming right like don't

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,260
be like that because we're all just

00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,900
building things on the front end and

00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,320
trying to make stuff so they just be

00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,650
like Chris just try and do a good job

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,650
