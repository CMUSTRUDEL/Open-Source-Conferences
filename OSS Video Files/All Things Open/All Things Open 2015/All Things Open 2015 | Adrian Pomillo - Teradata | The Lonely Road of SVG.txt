alright I'm going to go ahead and get

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,480
started because it is getting close to

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,570
the end of the day the last session so

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,779
this presentation is actually an

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,240
accident it's the lonely road of SVG how

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,609
many people here actively use SVG and

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,949
their programming day-to-day okay you

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,990
people are the ones that I needed a lot

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,900
of help from when I was given an

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,430
opportunity so my favorite character

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,719
Leatherface just walking down though so

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,100
misunderstood so is an SVG about me a

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,620
little bit i'm a UI architect at

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,329
teradata I'm always hacking on things

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,190
different things outside of work and

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,829
this so I'm giving another presentation

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,329
tomorrow which is drones in JavaScript

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,850
so you can see a little bit of a

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,980
disconnect here SVG and flying stuff

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,690
with JavaScript all resulting in the

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,629
same thing chaos for anybody who has to

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,789
use what i use i am not an artist i

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,030
would say i'm a designer in the sense of

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,519
I understand design principles I am NOT

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,119
going to be Johnny I've I get that but

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,350
we can put together some useful and

00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:12,299
intelligent interfaces and things for

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,549
people to use here I've got a few things

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,189
that I want to clarify it this won't be

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,380
a design session not going to get into

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,930
all the browser fallbacks because at

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,939
this point in time as of ie ie 9 and up

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,220
we've got a lot of SVG stuff handled

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,530
already it's not the world of ie8 if it

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,780
is there are plenty of libraries Raphael

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,900
j/s if you got to use SVG that can help

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,670
you get past those things I feel for you

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,130
if you have to battle the older stuff

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,570
but I know you do have to sometimes

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:42,869
testing no there will be no unit tests

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,610
in here okay beautiful code this code

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,990
that I've written for the sample app and

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,909
everything like that is to meant to be

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,329
as simple as possible to get things done

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,850
not meant to be in an eloquent style of

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,490
writing JavaScript or the coolest way in

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,570
the world to use a CSS so you'll see

00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,920
some things where you'll say wait I

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,159
would never do that production I

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,180
probably would but in not suggesting you

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,160
do so what this is it's a true story I'm

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,800
going to cover SVG basics I'm going to

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,670
show SVG animations but I was thinking

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,900
you know I was going to do a bunch of

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,069
demos of the animation

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,930
and I was like you know it's kind of a

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,430
waste there's plenty of things I can

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,620
show online that are already there on

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,220
some might say well that's kind of a cop

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,329
out but you'll understand in a minute

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,950
libraries will cut will touch base on a

00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:28,230
few libraries that if I had known about

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,180
when I had gotten started I would have

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,299
just used those and stop trying to do

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,000
things with document create element SVG

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:38,159
namespace all that stuff so I been in a

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,980
situation that looked a little something

00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,780
like this uh we had a product they

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,060
needed to build a whiteboard component

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,829
and we had to have you know all these

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,150
wonderful lines drawing two nodes and

00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:49,769
things like that which is real simple

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,540
right you just throw something up there

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,549
and you know I heard a few wise guy say

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,129
oh you could do that with CSS for boxes

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:59,220
hearing that no no no please don't use

00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:00,959
CSS to draw things stick with SVG you'll

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,489
be better off but what happened was

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,470
everybody kind of looked around and I

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,420
got the opportunity and it was actually

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,609
one of the coolest things I've gotten to

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,870
work on in the UI in a while for me I'm

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:11,549
always in the JavaScript I enjoy that

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,859
and stuff but this was a challenge

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,659
because honestly I'd never used SVG

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,669
before so I figured how hard could this

00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:20,250
be right go grab an o'reilly book read

00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,750
up on some tags it's xml what's the big

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,449
deal somebody does something illustrator

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,019
oh wait yeah the design team made an

00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:30,359
awesome design in photoshop now we've

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,609
got to build it and it's dynamic you

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:34,980
could have three nodes or a thousand

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,750
nodes it could have counts it might have

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,730
text and all sorts of things you got a

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,560
pan it you gotta zoom it I have a very

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,530
basic example of that here that'll show

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,479
but um just to get into why I had to

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,129
choose or why I decided to go with SVG

00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,859
and why you might want you for different

00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,659
things obviously scalable vector graphic

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,220
it's not a raster which means zoom in

00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,109
zoom out do all those things that you

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,609
want you don't get pixilation this is

00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,310
killer for everybody that's to deal with

00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,840
retina displays all right stop trying to

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,030
make a PNG for everything in the world

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,940
of every size you could probably rock it

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,769
here do some SVG you also get super

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,629
small file sizes too if you're going to

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,030
have inline SVG and you're not creating

00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,620
it on the fly with JavaScript you can

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,299
get this stuff compressed pretty tight

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,909
just like you would with any HTML things

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,979
it can be in certain instances cashable

00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:21,840
okay so you can cash things and if you

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:24,479
have the right approach scaled any size

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,670
arm like I crossed out nice know if

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,700
you're dealing with retina stuff

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,380
I'd just do this interactive you can get

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,390
interactive with SVG this isn't just

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,380
images I mean remember the last time I

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,320
don't know any but raise your hand if

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,300
anybody here ever use an image map all

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,760
right yes all right I got some people

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,410
you can share the pain they know with

00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,960
image Maps that's not interactivity

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,400
we're talking animations filters things

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,390
like that that are going on some serious

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,690
stuff um filters I will say this that

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,490
was my nightmare right there I am

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,990
looking for somebody who can maybe after

00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,120
this presentation come up into Adrian

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm gonna solve your biggest ANC's

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,940
you've had with all this I'm going to

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,100
show you how to make a drop shadow

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,650
filter dynamic and work in all browsers

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,080
because I've had it it's awesome in

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,030
chrome the nodes disappeared in Firefox

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,800
but they still show up an IE wait what's

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,630
going on then Safari doesn't show the

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,800
notes things like that doing a drop

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,510
shadow filter you cannot use CSS

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,950
box-shadow all that stuff job no no no

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,690
you've got to use the filters and all

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,580
that I had a nightmare getting it to

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,900
work and it was so unpredictable on

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,060
various platforms and various browsers

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,590
that that was one of those trade-offs I

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,150
had to make with the design team which

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,890
kind of sucked for me in the sense that

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,540
I really thought the use of the drop

00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,400
shadow for the first time the way we

00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,600
were going to use it really popped and

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,750
really set things off and it kind of

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,520
stunk that we had some issues um and the

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,740
last one because CSS wasn't meant for

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,080
drawing not too long ago I was the clown

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,270
who drew a school bus with the Grateful

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,280
Dead sign on it all out of CSS box div

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,560
tags okay I did stuff like that thought

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,110
that was so cool you know do logos and

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,660
things and CSS div tags with HTML yet

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,120
what a waste of time that was but on to

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,890
other things before i show you some code

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,260
because there'll be more code here than

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,190
a lot of this stuff but some SVG tools

00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,470
are familiar with adobe illustrator

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,540
sketch inkscape etc they go on and on

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,830
when I talk about these tools that's a

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,200
situation where you're getting an

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,360
initial SVG created for you somebody

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,670
goes in they draw it out adobe

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,800
illustrator is absolutely killer and the

00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,270
fact that you can export to SVG and you

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,040
get all these things and you get these

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,020
paths you get this XML document you can

00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,180
work with but with that and I'll show

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,860
you that in a second you're going to

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,840
want some other things like I said Rafi

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,730
ljs that's going to be great for you if

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,630
you've got to do all the polyfill for

00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:41,060
all the old browsers SVG j/s and snap

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:44,780
sv gjs if you're going to do any

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,130
animations significant with that is

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,780
beyond just moving things on the screen

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,370
but like really significant following

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,730
paths doing all this crazy stuff with

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,400
your SVG's just stop and go grab one of

00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,810
those libraries okay you will you'll get

00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,720
wrapped around the axle trying to get it

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,240
to work in all browsers it's there's

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,040
fallbacks things like that you would

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,630
normally do like text on a path works in

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,100
one browser one way and animates

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,430
perfectly but you go to another browser

00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,660
not quite right these snaps snap SVG

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,520
which I'll show you some code for that

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,140
it's actually if I had seen that a while

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,140
ago I would have totally used that when

00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,830
I started off on this project I'm an SVG

00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:24,850
optimizer so let me jump in here real

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:28,220
quick to show you this the SVG optimizer

00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:30,020
it's a simple online site right here you

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,620
can go in here you can choose a file you

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,300
can upload it it will strip out when

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,830
tools make your SVG's for you they put a

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,990
lot of metadata in there for the apps to

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,100
understand it you want all that out you

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,810
want to get rid of all that you want to

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,000
compress the white space yank out

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,370
comments things you don't need to get

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,650
that file size down so this is super

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,410
valuable tool there are ones you can use

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,730
using node any node developers here okay

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,350
great you could there's a couple tools

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,630
out there I did have a problem with one

00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,640
of them not being able to get the things

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,400
quite the way I wanted to but then again

00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,840
I wasn't doing like take an ad and make

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,150
an ad interactive we were actually

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,890
taking like we're making an interactive

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,510
implementation of a component so it was

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,770
a little different but I'd recommend

00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,100
this I just wanted to show that to you

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,330
guys real quick so going into this so

00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,830
we'll go into it when I get into

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,510
implementations will go through a few

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,880
things and jump into some code so

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,040
implementations SVG can be used in your

00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,430
app as an image as a background image in

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,480
line as an object and as a data URI I'm

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,940
not going to get too much in the data

00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,760
URI stuff but you remember taking making

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,890
that long URL tall the crazy encryption

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,479
everything the bytecode all the code for

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,760
your image that's kind of the way you

00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,260
could do it object using the object tag

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,120
embedding it that way in line you're

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,090
actually going to put the code in line

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,500
you can also bring a file in for that

00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,760
the background image and as an image

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,530
you're going to go to a lot of if you

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,550
have to build components you're going to

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,350
Google a lot and you're going to get a

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,490
lot of the same sites and you're going

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,140
to see this o is a backer

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,209
that's cool no I'm not building a

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,310
background image I'm building an actual

00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:59,959
component that we need the capabilities

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,880
to draw different angles or do different

00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,980
things like that and here's the big

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,020
issue you'll see this stuff you see my

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,970
file dot SVG cool goes in as an image

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,709
that's great when you do that

00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,330
implementation you can't style it with

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:12,620
external style sheets you cannot get

00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,330
into the energy cannot have any

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,649
interactivity with it so if you need

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,750
interactivity and all that stuff just

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,610
kind of can that one just get that out

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,839
of the way the background image very

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,570
similar you notice how we're doing the

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,700
URL my file all that same situations

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,080
that you'll run into there so those two

00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,760
if you have to have interactivity and

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,410
get in there and style things with

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,300
external style sheets and stuff just

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,430
stay away from the examples that say

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,589
this is how to do it you'll go crazy

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,760
you'll wonder why you can't get it right

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:40,399
and they seem to get it always right in

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,170
the tutorial there's some element types

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,930
will go over but let's just jump in and

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,640
look at something along absolutely goofy

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,890
and probably not of any value in the

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,459
real world but I wanted to build a quick

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:55,279
little demo app I love sneakers so got a

00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,990
quick SVG out there sneaker optimize the

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,279
code a little bit and then we said you

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,040
know what if somebody was creating a

00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,560
sneaker our custom sneakers so we go

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,620
over here use the typical html5 stuff

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,250
you know hey cool check this out you

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,029
know I will make that green we make that

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,209
so we'll just go ahead and we'll

00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:18,020
customize this a little bit here we'll

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:18,920
do the wave so here we are so somebody

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,140
asked you how many of you have ever

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,459
ordered customized t-shirts remember

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,589
that you know you pick the colors you

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:26,959
put the stripes and all that think about

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:29,120
it get an illustrator somebody is really

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,990
good at racing out those pictures and

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,940
stuff like that because you don't want

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,920
the shaky or Jake lines they go into

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,540
illustrator they make the SVG for you

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,149
and I'll just show you this is

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,230
ridiculously amounts of tiny code that

00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:41,180
you'd ever have to write and it's all

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,980
native and that's what I loved about SVG

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,020
trying to do this there's been other

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,700
examples oh go get images I've got

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,779
images precast you know what I mean for

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,390
making those t-shirts and you like this

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,250
something like this the SVG is far

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:55,160
bigger the code for the SVG is far

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,660
bigger than the app itself so let's look

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,750
at the code here is that too tiny for

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,900
everybody a little bit all right we're

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:05,100
going to bump this up how does that

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:08,560
matter okay

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,089
so let's jump down here these are all

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,730
the shapes that you're going to see this

00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:14,769
all these pads fill all these crazy

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,199
numbers and stuff that's that sneaker

00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:20,819
all drawn out that's what right between

00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:24,790
that SVG tag on 188 all the way up to

00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:26,380
what do we got 77 that's an SVG embedded

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,089
in line this you don't put into

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,769
production like this why all that white

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:31,720
space comments you know I mean we can

00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:33,610
optimize that and get that smaller and

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,889
get it better but that drew the sneaker

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,060
for you now we went ahead we colored it

00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:39,250
right we had the interactivity with

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,509
JavaScript I had buttons up top but

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,370
guess what I can throw it on click event

00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:44,050
on one of these elements too so you can

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,399
actually click it on click same thing is

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,779
like a button would here's the

00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,810
JavaScript we were doing just changing

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:52,480
the phils it's real simple javascript

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:55,569
starts online to 14 and that whole app

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,060
is done online 238 okay there's nothing

00:11:55,569 --> 00:12:00,190
to this there's no jquery folks didn't

00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,800
need jquery for it i'm a big proponent

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,690
of vanilla JavaScript do you believe

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,339
that jQuery is needed so not bashing

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,439
jquery okay it's needed when you've got

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:10,300
legacy systems big apps but all we're

00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:11,829
doing here document query selector I

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,389
picked the color picker that was just

00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:14,709
the html5 color picker you want

00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:16,420
something fancy you're going to have to

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:18,490
make more but just think about that I'm

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,529
able to make select a shape what did i

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,420
do I went I got the element by the ID

00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:24,880
that was passing off the button fill

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,220
opacity got the value off of what the

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,860
opacity was got the value off the color

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,589
picker and the SVG changed the cool part

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,910
about this is what i love about sv Jesus

00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:38,769
we can take this big small it's not

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,509
pixelized right so when you got the

00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:43,000
people who had to have they got that a

00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,649
giant JavaScript app to have the color

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,689
in this or that or things like that this

00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,610
is simple but how about going out and

00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:50,110
getting the map of the United States SVG

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,060
coordinates available everywhere right

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,980
you ever had to plot something show

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,319
something quick on not technically on a

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,689
real map with real lat lon situations

00:12:56,319 --> 00:13:01,000
but high-end stuff like that you can do

00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:03,730
very simply JavaScript right here was

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,089
tiny so this app probably took me it

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,980
took me about 15 minutes in JavaScript

00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:12,069
to write it and it took me about a day

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,600
and a half to get the SVG right because

00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:15,760
i tried to use one of those tools and

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,410
trace the lines myself then I found an

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,810
awesome online service that I could

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,450
upload

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,029
a file in it would output SVG so then of

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:25,850
course as my friends know me I'm always

00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:27,800
sort of like well what can we break next

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,230
so one of my favorite movies in the

00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,420
world was Big Trouble in Little China I

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,950
love this movie so my fingers let's make

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,180
a movie poster here right let's do this

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,320
in SVG well that's yeah don't do that um

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,830
is because that'll look something like

00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,360
this colors you got to get all that

00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,580
right but then you want to take a look

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,360
at something intense let's see it's just

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:53,480
view the page source there you go and

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,880
that just keeps going so understand

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,500
anything can be abused but with this

00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,420
stuff enjoy it you can have fun but the

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,589
scalable part the interaction of it the

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,740
hardest part for me was getting the

00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,270
quality image getting the outlines for

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,130
so let's talk about that app I mentioned

00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,350
this is not the full production app by

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,810
any means this is just a baby component

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,240
early on in the stages of development

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,980
have we had an angular app okay anybody

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,550
here working with angular all right

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:23,270
anybody here working with d3 okay d3

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:25,730
with angular all right you know pain you

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,950
know pain right the whole idea of an

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,780
angular it's got its own scope so you go

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,430
any draw things and everybody's like man

00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,520
you're gonna use SVG you gotta go used

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:37,880
III d3 is awesome No so I want to warn

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:40,670
you d 3 has nothing to do with SVG okay

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,040
it'll render tags on a screen for you

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,510
you can just so happen use SVG because

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,250
you want to do that for bar charts lines

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,810
paths things like that it's got features

00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,420
in there but it's not something that

00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:53,420
makes your life with SVG any easier and

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,980
I'll and I'll show you why so this app

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,830
is just real simple it's hard to see

00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,839
that the resolution is horrible but

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,390
we've got a situation here we expand we

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,770
collapse here's the downside this was

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,330
early on but you're going to see this

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,550
redraw itself I would never want that

00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,260
like that for production but

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,510
unfortunately angular we had to destroy

00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,100
the root recreate kind of gets crazy but

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,250
here you go I'm just scaling panning all

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,470
this stuff this is a d3 using that with

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,630
angular but it's SVG's one of the big

00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,060
things we had to do was highlight a note

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,110
and center it so now here we go we got

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,459
to highlight all the way back to the

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,680
route where there was a problem right I

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:31,160
learned an interesting trick here with

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,399
SVG SVG is not like anything like H

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,110
tml there is no document flow okay if

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,209
you got the idea that i'm going to use

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,639
z-index to overlay something on top of

00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:42,680
another piece stop right there you'll

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,540
beat your head self senseless you'll

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,779
look you'll google and you'll wonder why

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,300
there's really no posts about how to use

00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,620
the index with SVG because you can so I

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,149
was the idiot who spent half a day

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,319
looking for that because they didn't

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,180
want to have to figure out how to draw

00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,410
over so then you learn little tricks

00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,899
like you got a path on top of another

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,339
path make the path when they get laid on

00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,379
each other there's an intersecting point

00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:04,819
and one shows over the other make the

00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,500
other one a little wider that's how we

00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,879
got the red a little wider than the grey

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,009
line so it looks like it's all the way

00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:12,439
there otherwise the final answer was to

00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:14,899
draw a path from that box all the way to

00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:16,310
the root note okay to get over things

00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:21,050
that are late in will show the code for

00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:22,399
that so let's jump back into a quick

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,129
thing here so we were going to talk

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,420
about shapes I'm not one big on slides I

00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:28,519
kind of like the worst thing in the

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,790
world to me is putting together a slide

00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,430
deck let's talk about testing for SVG

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,470
you can do this now if you want there's

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,959
a few things I read up on but I'll be

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,639
honest with you we're using d3 with the

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,680
production app and in my personal apps

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,930
that i make myself I'm the worst

00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,939
developer out there you can't use SVG

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,670
and I made something sv genus my own

00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:51,769
personal stuff sorry you know what I

00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,139
mean upgrade your browser get chrome get

00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:55,699
something but when I work for somebody

00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,439
and I'm working for a company it's not

00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:58,850
like that you got to take care of it use

00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:00,800
libraries for fallbacks things like that

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,139
but here's one that's been coming out

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,000
looking for type of SVG wrecked if it's

00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:07,549
undefined what to do take care of that

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,530
SVG image this is the as an image thing

00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:14,319
there's been some talk about this line

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:17,150
right here oh gosh it's horrible um oh

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,409
man it's going to be horrible sorry

00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,380
about that folks I didn't realize the

00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:22,880
resolution would be like that um but in

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,380
here i'm going to upload all this to get

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,870
hub you can go ahead take a look at the

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,700
stuff have fun with whatever you want

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:30,679
and then there's getattribute anna by

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,000
name space and i put Matt on this one

00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,400
because what they're saying is document

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,820
create an element SVG and then get

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,200
attribute name space okay that's cool if

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,659
you create it with a namespace so

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,460
there's a namespace for SVG you can

00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,630
create elements without namespaces so

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,310
I'm not sure

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,460
how reliable that technique would be

00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:51,830
work to work for testing for SVG so

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:57,460
that's one aspect there um boy this is

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:59,300
really going to be rough um so shapes

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,680
let's get down to the basics here

00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,930
everybody's seen there's rectangles

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,110
their circles there's an ellipse there's

00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:08,750
a line there's polylines polygons oh wow

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,790
cool shapes what's the big deal all it

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,230
comes down to and let's go right over

00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:17,060
here to shapes that should look better

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,620
four rectangles real simple things here

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,440
um when you're working with all this

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,700
stuff you can control we'll talk about

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,550
it there's properties that you can

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,080
control with CSS and ones you cannot the

00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,240
ones right now just get over trying to

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,280
control X Y width and height with CSS

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,750
just just stop it'll drive you nuts

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,170
you'll think it's working but it's not

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,790
okay x and y's are handled in SVG as

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,050
attributes right there so you're going

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,840
to have to directly hit the nodes to do

00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,070
that stuff or you wrap them in an

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,530
element i'll show you how we do for the

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,210
expanding and stuff of a G element which

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,420
is actually a grouping element and you

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,490
can use transform so your CSS transform

00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,470
is what you're going to do for x and y

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,440
is for transform translate you won't be

00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:59,440
able to directly affect this in CSS so

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,460
there's a rectangle there's a circle

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,600
interesting thing about a circle is

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:08,050
radius 550 @ CX CY if this is on we

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,460
probably won't see well on the screen is

00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:12,230
that when you do circles and you're

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:15,020
trying to wonder why the heck it's over

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,660
here all the time and halfway off CX CY

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:20,030
is the XY coordinate of its center and

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,320
that is going to default 0 0 everything

00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,140
in the world and SVG is in this

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,520
coordinate system this box 00 okay

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,350
everything's up there you have to

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,780
position all your elements within the

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:32,060
SVG canvas or you can group them in

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,860
position groups so get ready for that

00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,330
and we'll show that'll be another

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,420
nightmare of moving things around but

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,310
it's not that bad once you figure it out

00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:44,210
ellipse is here you go this is a perfect

00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:47,240
thing translate we got the 9250 got rx

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,520
ry rounded corners on those rectangles

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,710
over here if you want rounded corners

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,570
they've got RX and ry attributes if you

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,820
only specify one the other ones defaults

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:58,100
to the same value so you don't have to

00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,490
specify both but I encourage you to do

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,140
so

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,630
because we don't want people to guess

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:06,440
what's going on just might as well spell

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:09,950
it out so you've got polylines again

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,890
these points are moved to a point drop

00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,050
at an XY coordinate go to the next point

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,910
go to the next point and that's how it

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,400
works that first set up is get to a

00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:21,050
point and then start drawing polygons

00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,580
now you'll see paths are just

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,860
continuations of all this stuff this is

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,450
drawing everything out so you can do

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,520
everything with a path that you're

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,290
seeing here but don't please use the

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,750
shortcut like rectangle or circle or

00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:35,000
square just use those tags save time but

00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:38,270
you can do everything with these which

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,980
like I said this is a path for giving an

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,340
idea here's a path for the soul the

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,350
rubber bottom move 2679 for you see that

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,210
crazy syntax you can draw circles

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:51,700
squares shapes anything you want using

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,700
paths don't do it if you don't have to

00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,440
let's see we will jump over to really

00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,000
okay so there they are that's the shapes

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,970
you saw kind of the code they're all

00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,880
pretty basic stuff some of the big

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,170
things though a view box this is the

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,340
craziest thing because I didn't know

00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,050
anything about view box I don't know

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,550
what the heck this meant height and

00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:13,429
width is what I put on all my SVG

00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:16,130
elements and heightened with specify 400

00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:18,650
by 400 x and y coordinates 0 0 in the

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:21,740
top left everything's cool this view box

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:25,040
concept is a little bit different think

00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,740
of SVG canvas is infinitely scalable it

00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,900
just goes everywhere anywhere the view

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,100
box is what you can put right on top of

00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,660
it and just kind of move it around you

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,000
remember those old the spotlight over

00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,980
the thing type thing you can do that so

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,440
with view box understanding how that

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,330
attribute works on SVG will be important

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,730
for all of you who need to scale for

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,980
responsive design or if you want to make

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,929
something larger with things off to the

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,750
side that aren't quite displayed yet and

00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:52,910
move or pan or have things brought in so

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,120
remember view box and you can see this

00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:57,320
box in here so let's go ahead and

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,740
massively fail at trying to do a live

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,220
demo of this I always have I'm full

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,179
positivity no

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:09,770
let's see here we go see where's my

00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:12,750
element okay let's take a look at this

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:15,210
that screen still it's pointless isn't

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:21,240
it I'm sorry let's go look at it in the

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:23,070
code editor oh so this view box will

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,200
catch you at time to time if you're not

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,809
prepared for but here's what we're

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,179
looking at that 1010 that you see right

00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:32,700
here that is on the rectangle that was a

00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:36,179
little offset so toggle back and forth I

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,640
got a SVG campus 400 by 400 I've said

00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,710
the view box XY 400 and 400 what I'm

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,950
saying is its coordinate systems will be

00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:46,320
0 0 at 0 0 and the SVG container I can

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,140
shift that so let me take this and

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,830
change this and watch it do absolutely

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,659
nothing because this kind of the way it

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,960
goes sometimes so you notice there's

00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:59,909
this space in there there's that gap

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,669
there goes I just basically took the

00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:05,700
coordinate system of the view area and

00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:07,830
moved it okay so I didn't move the SVG

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,450
but I've now changed the coordinates for

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,220
everything in there they're going to be

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,580
working off the view boxes coordinates

00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,110
so if you ever end up in a situation

00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,409
where somebody's got this going on and

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:21,090
you think you're going to put oh yeah 00

00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:22,559
you know this this will work this should

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,950
work watch it watch it actually make me

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,240
look like a fool there it is it just

00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,490
keeps moving off you know what I mean

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,780
now it's like 20 pixels off the other

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,880
way so when you're looking at that

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,650
you're like why isn't things lining up

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,150
that's a huge catch right there check

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,280
the view box dimensions see if anybody's

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,990
messing with those if we want to do that

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,780
get that back to the 10 like this check

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:45,630
this and this should probably I hope

00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,549
work there there you go okay so now my

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,940
coordinates weren't 00 anymore they were

00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:53,010
to the view box which the view boxes now

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,510
change the coordinates of the SVG so

00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,730
keep that in mind that's a number one

00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,530
killer for me why things wouldn't line

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,330
up and everybody was like nothing's

00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,549
lining up everything is off by like five

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,980
or six or eight pixels what is it view

00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:07,169
box is usually being controlled it is

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,970
very valuable though if you just got to

00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:10,679
know when you're using it so element

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,630
types to keep in mind we've got

00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:14,669
structural descriptive animation

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,990
gradient filters and shakes and we'll

00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:17,820
get it show a few of those

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,700
there's some special tags and attributes

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,950
to keep in mind don't repeat yourself as

00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,420
everybody knows the dry principal some

00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:28,500
interesting things if you're going to

00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:31,230
use embedded CSS or inline CSS to keep

00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,260
in mind would be this let's take a look

00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:37,110
at this I have an SVG element here

00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,250
inside here I have a definition tags I

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:43,830
have a rectangle XY height 50 20 and now

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,840
I have this tag called use see what I'm

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:49,290
doing there and what I'm doing is I'm

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,700
referencing the ID to what's up here so

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,800
I don't have to keep spitting all this

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,600
stuff out so it's a great way to like

00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,070
okay this is the component this is a

00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,440
button I made because I need it to be a

00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:00,600
star this is the shape this was always

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,220
what it's going to be one time in the

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,559
definition somebody else can redefine it

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:08,010
and you can come down here and I can now

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,190
use it twice okay this one is not doing

00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:13,679
anything this one is overriding the

00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:15,000
orange giving a fill i'm going to show

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,730
you the screen and i'm going to ask if

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,320
anybody i had a problem getting height

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,730
and width to work even as properties

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,500
when i put them down here they weren't

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,660
working in chrome so if i change the

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,520
height and width it still kept

00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,140
inheriting the height and width here it

00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,390
when i took that out then the element

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,280
wouldn't display so some quirky things

00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,800
i'm not sure why or what the situation

00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,320
is but as a heads up i ran into that

00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,210
using this linear this is like the

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,190
gradients right here to create a

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,660
gradient you want to do that in the

00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,910
death tag so you can reuse it over and

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,110
over different things all this stuff

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,820
that you're seeing right here if you

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,470
were to do it dynamically in JavaScript

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,540
basically you're going to do is you're

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,640
going to create an SVG element you're

00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,070
going to go create a def definition

00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,510
element inside the SVG get what I'm get

00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,800
where I'm going with this and even with

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,900
JavaScript you're actually going to

00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,809
build this thing out so like if I were

00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,690
to let's just jump over to that

00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:10,309
whiteboard piece that you saw every

00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:14,490
square every piece that you saw drawn

00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:16,080
isn't this this is a generator service

00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,179
that we had to do line functions were

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,080
drawing lines SVG counts let's see we've

00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,429
got ya there's the service this is

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,820
laying out these little pills that had

00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:28,930
numbers in it this is all JavaScript set

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,820
text attribute by the way text

00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,710
is another fun thing to fight with it

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,810
does not work like paragraphs or text in

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,310
regular HTML markup you're going to

00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,770
learn about t spans you're going to

00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:41,050
learn start beginning middle and where

00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,430
things line up if you say something like

00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,920
text in the little text box is 100

00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,930
pixels and you say i want it to line up

00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,880
in the to the align middle what it does

00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:51,310
actually takes the text and shoves it to

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,020
the 00 or that XY coordinate of the text

00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,600
element so that shifts way over there it

00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:58,360
doesn't float around so nothing floats

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,000
around an SVG so it can get kind of

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,230
gnarly we had to do some calculations to

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,060
get some things down there so this is

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:06,070
just a bunch of stuff all this code you

00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,080
see right here in JavaScript doing it

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,030
natively in JavaScript all you probably

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:16,230
remember setattribute all this type of

00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:22,270
stuff all that just to do where are we

00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:24,610
to draw one of these yd3 is awesome you

00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,530
can create trees and it will render and

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,540
give you you give it data it will

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,950
augment your data and tell you XY

00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,990
coordinates and lay it out for you

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,120
that's a huge value so if you got to do

00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,160
tree type structures d3 is huge there

00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,010
you passing data and augments thing is

00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,310
in d3 code let's take a look at what

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:46,360
some of that basic stuff might look like

00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:47,890
right here let's see this would be we've

00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,630
got no type so there was a situation

00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,580
where these shapes could change

00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,110
dynamically depending on data so we

00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,550
didn't always know the node was out they

00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,740
show you trees they always got the cool

00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,850
circle and it always works but they

00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,530
don't show you is if you've got to

00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:01,540
change that circle to a diamond or some

00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:04,390
path not just another shape you got to

00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:08,230
kind of put some logic in there SVG does

00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:10,270
stuff like this append and it takes a G

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:13,870
which is a grouping node this is how

00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:15,250
think of a GNote as like a div tag it

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:17,290
doesn't have any real display properties

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,760
it just allows you to group elements so

00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,380
if I have these nodes that you saw on

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,080
the screen when one of them moves all

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,610
the things with it move together okay

00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,620
because you don't nest things inside of

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,850
a rectangle or anything like that so you

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,440
want to do that this type of thing but

00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,990
here does it appends a G element right

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,270
that's great comes down here I did an

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,680
attribute transform that's how I get XY

00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:38,020
coordinates moving things like that

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,760
there some changing things but as you

00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,710
can come down here I got to append

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,669
another element so I'm passing in some

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,580
data the problem is

00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:47,049
I can't just say an if statement here or

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,970
write a little function that returns a

00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:50,679
string that looks like rectangle or

00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:52,539
circle or things like that it looks like

00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,970
you would you actually have got to go

00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:57,249
create when doing d3 like this stuff for

00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:58,840
shapes in certain situations you have to

00:28:57,249 --> 00:29:01,960
go back and actually create an actual

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,210
node element an actual SVG element in

00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,059
javascript is create node with namespace

00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:10,869
all that and return that to be passed on

00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:12,429
so every time you see this rendering you

00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:14,159
have a bunch of native JavaScript but to

00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:17,230
get these different shapes based on data

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,440
it had to go in d3 pool I know where to

00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,700
lay out wait what shape do you want um

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,889
okay use regular JavaScript call

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,619
function I gotta return an actual note

00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:28,269
so the mark-up let's see what this let's

00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:31,359
take a look at this is this going to

00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:35,460
yeah this is gonna I'm sorry we're going

00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:38,559
to Jack this thing up come on all right

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,330
just to give you an idea and when I'm

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,909
natively rendering that that SVG there

00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:48,159
like anything else with JavaScript let's

00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:52,570
see get better with your tools um c to

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,220
to to to do okay yeah it's all in the

00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,999
script tag there we go I'm wonderful

00:29:54,220 --> 00:30:00,399
here we go whiteboard SVG hey looks

00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:02,169
simple its all rendering this is a

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,330
graphic tag see what I've got there

00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:06,309
inside its got a path because it drew a

00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,529
circle or druid diamond all those

00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:10,029
coordinates are there then there's

00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:11,919
continues on these are all the paths

00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:14,139
actually what they did is laid down

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,879
excuse me on this first G element all

00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:18,039
those lines you see connecting the trees

00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:19,989
those are paths laid out they lay it

00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:22,509
down first then you put the nodes on top

00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:23,830
ok if you lay down and when a node

00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:26,049
renders the first one that gets rendered

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,730
everything gets stacked on top of it so

00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:29,590
if there's any intersection points it's

00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:31,259
always behind what comes after it so

00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:35,019
that's what we mean by no flow on that

00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:37,509
let's see come up here this would be

00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:40,419
interaction point one of those points

00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:42,039
it's a shape it's got a path in it

00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:43,570
because this one's a diamond this is the

00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:45,759
text stuff to get the decision point

00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,440
label text anchor middle we're using

00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,450
ends there but you see we're doing it

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,129
right on the ex-wives right there we're

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,499
doing that with JavaScript so just keep

00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:55,570
in mind when somebody says oh yeah man

00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:55,929
t3 is going to be your SVG Savior things

00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,360
like that

00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:59,679
no no it's it's a great selector query

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,970
selector engine it's great at

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,039
calculating things giving you where

00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,330
lines should go tree components like

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,999
that you're still going to be writing

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,950
SVG and like i said this presentation

00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:11,379
was more of an accident because of the

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,029
struggles I went through so we went

00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:15,070
through the shapes property flows

00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:16,929
remember these key things you can't set

00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,269
height with positions in CSS with your

00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:21,220
SVG so don't don't keep trying to you

00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:23,230
can use transforms you can use the

00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,580
transform to handle things but actually

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,759
setting on attributes now you want to do

00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,200
on the group's styling attributes you

00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,210
can check them out there's the whole

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,190
thing there at the links there there's

00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,360
no document flow as there is an HTML

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,159
there's no such thing as floating

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,230
something over or something else bumping

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,749
it everything's positioned in SVG when

00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,580
you're building interfaces no Z index

00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:44,019
that's right if you rendered something

00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,059
first and there's stuff overlapping it

00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:48,279
hey guess what you're gonna have to

00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:49,779
re-render it on top or wait to when to

00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,460
render it and when to put it in so

00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:54,220
remember you're stacking order of the

00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:56,289
way things come down you are how which

00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,999
rendered is how its stack you cannot

00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:02,139
change it like you can with Z index in

00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:04,539
HTML presentation attributes ok these

00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:07,450
are when you saw the fill tag will go

00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:10,690
right here oh let's see this is not a

00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:13,960
yeah so look at this CSS for a second

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,700
presentation attributes fill fill color

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,749
you know things like Phil dash call all

00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,820
those attributes and stuff like that

00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:21,610
those are presentation attributes they

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,679
override user agent always but even

00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,840
though you see these the tag right there

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,299
on the attribute this is yellow or red

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,940
CSS right here that you see embedded in

00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:34,119
a def set in a definite attack this will

00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,559
override it every time so let me see

00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,330
there we go so one of the things about

00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,799
your CSS its understanding the

00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,840
inheritance when using it with these

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,669
presentation tags that'll kill you too

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,679
you're like I cannot change the color of

00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:47,259
this darn node and I've had it changed

00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,869
on the line in line it's the Cascade

00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:51,789
order CSS will come in stop right over

00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:54,340
everything like that so it goes first

00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:56,669
thing applied as a user agent style next

00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:59,139
thing applied is SVG's presentation

00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:01,210
attributes then after that is style

00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:03,129
sheets in line style sheets and so forth

00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,619
and so on so just remember those

00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:07,330
presentation attributes are really small

00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:09,520
on the food chain that get gobbled up

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,870
quickly so

00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,580
you can do style sheets by having a

00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:14,290
regular CSS file that you reference and

00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,120
use it with classes like you saw in the

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:18,460
app that I had there or you can embed

00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,590
them so this is how you would embed for

00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,660
object and things like that to handle

00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:25,720
that you can see right there it's

00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:27,070
rectangle Phil stroke stroke with one

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,870
thing I would like to encourage people

00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:32,530
and I know that they're hardcore CSS

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:34,270
people would say don't do it but uh here

00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,270
I'll show you you can get mad at me it's

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:38,530
all good the reason I say this is you

00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,940
never know who's going to work on your

00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,340
code when you're done when you're gone

00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,380
or if you're not around and the last

00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,670
thing you want is somebody to say yeah

00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,970
i'm just going to start moving things

00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:51,280
around here and all that so what i do

00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:55,690
and i know it makes no sense but bear

00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:57,790
with me see this SVG headline as an ID

00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,520
with a pre qualifier I mean come on

00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:01,720
rookie move right an ID is an ID you

00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,730
don't need to put anything else around

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,830
it that's what it goes to bear with me

00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,960
here i use i just put the SVG in front

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,909
of those on all my styles that actually

00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,149
focus on SVG so that the next person

00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:15,040
coming through goes oh that's for SVG I

00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,230
either know about it or I don't which

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,490
means they don't run in and say yeah I'm

00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,710
going to get rid of this thing this

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:23,380
makes no sense that's not part of you

00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,669
know CSS that I know if that's what we

00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,600
want to make sure it doesn't happen so

00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:33,280
it's just kind of a workflow tip let's

00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:35,140
see let's see animations things to keep

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,550
in mind I'll quickly show the SVG I hope

00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:39,610
don't know how it'll work with screen

00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:41,230
but um smile or SML synchronized

00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,790
multimedia integration language was how

00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,100
they wanted to do all the animation

00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,720
stuff with SVG it's never been supported

00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,880
in IE and chrome is no longer going to

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,169
support it save your time don't even

00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,820
bother with it the minute you see an

00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:53,470
example using that just kind of move on

00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:57,520
if you're going to do heavy animations

00:34:53,470 --> 00:35:00,370
with SVG just go I hate to say cuz i'm

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,940
not a big go get a library person but go

00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:07,510
get snap SVG or SVG is just those will

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,030
help you out a lot CSS animations works

00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:12,210
on shared properties so that means if

00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:14,920
there's a shared property let's say um

00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:16,870
well color you can't no colors not a

00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,900
shared property so i can't really do

00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:22,760
anything there opacity is right to make

00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,380
things change that you can work that on

00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,830
few of the things anything that's shared

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,540
between regular CSS and applies to SVG

00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,280
you can use transform and animations

00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,660
with those if it doesn't you're not

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,640
doing much with X wise you can't do

00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,310
words on paths things like that that's

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,470
why you want the libraries SVG is an

00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:40,700
image and background image if you're

00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,750
going to put animations in that and

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,980
that's how you going to do it you got to

00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,660
embed those animations with the

00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,310
animation tags they have tags that

00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,150
structure out all the animation I mean

00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:52,130
it's XML so there's tag for everything

00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:53,480
you can use object like an image but it

00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,070
you've got to include its CSS

00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,140
interactions so here's an interesting

00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,360
thing hovers won't happen when you use

00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,700
your SVG as an image or background image

00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,260
they will in an object the best way

00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,750
though if you've got to go in line with

00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,160
something write it in line in there and

00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,630
you got full interactivity with it you

00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,400
can do it but remembers start with a

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,780
giant file size you're going to bloat so

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,980
get that narrowed down if you're doing

00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,220
it dynamically that's the way you're

00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:18,140
going to want to do it anyway let's see

00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:21,170
other pitfalls presentation attributes

00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:22,910
we already talked about that no

00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,800
disappears when using filters like I

00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,810
said earlier it's a fun one put a drop

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,250
shadow on something watch it work great

00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,320
in two browsers and the third one the

00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,650
note just doesn't appear so when you're

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,050
working with SVG and you've applied a

00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,580
gradient of filter any of that stuff and

00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,560
all of a sudden something disappears

00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,330
from your screen I'll save you a ton of

00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,640
time it's what you just added is the

00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,560
filter okay the filter the gradient it's

00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,360
right there that's the problem how it's

00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,950
using either using the URL is the

00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,300
browser okay with that so when stuff

00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,640
starts disappearing from your screen

00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,830
randomly and you're using all those

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,510
filters and drop in are those type of

00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,530
things that's where it is that's where

00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,420
it's usually always going to be it's not

00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:02,420
going to be in how you wrote the node

00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:04,190
element or anything like that CSS

00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,860
transform origin this is kind of a funny

00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,480
one it works almost identical to HTML

00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:13,370
but when you start moving things if I

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:15,560
rotate a box in CSS HTML 45 degrees it

00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,700
just turns in the screen right I won't

00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,020
be able to it's not going to render well

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:23,450
so i'm not going to show it here but it

00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:27,300
just turns 45 degrees right in SVG when

00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:35,430
i do something like that let's see

00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:37,020
oh let's see it was the view box that's

00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,580
what it'll do why is it doing that

00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,550
because it's going off the coordinates

00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:43,670
of its x00 up in those corners so if

00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,200
you're going to rotate something in SVG

00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,660
you're going to also have to handle the

00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,700
transform the XY for it as well so it's

00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,620
going to move off its pivot point okay

00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,780
circles that's where if you've ever seen

00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,010
those loaders people do with SVG and all

00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,540
of a sudden you're doing one and you

00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,710
change the XY because you wanted to move

00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,030
a little bit all of a sudden it jerks

00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,950
off the screen and kind of reappears

00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,660
that's why it's using a different

00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,780
coordinate system than you think so if

00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,040
you're changing rotating anything

00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,780
rotations mainly you've got to change

00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,670
the transforms on your SVG elements

00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,800
otherwise they don't they don't rotate

00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:16,620
in place like they do in HTML because

00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:20,970
there is no concept in SVG of a block

00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:24,060
level element it does not exist um so

00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:30,290
kicks creator you saw I hope in the

00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:32,880
screen here will work with me snap SVG

00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,470
this is pretty cool there's some stuff

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,760
here for their animation I don't know

00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:38,850
anything about coffee but I learned

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,740
something I click mocha and all.svg it

00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,310
rotates around fills out another pie

00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,110
chart I its got milk in it a macchiato

00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:48,660
what's that guy all right Morton yeah

00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,490
there we go an espresso as you can see

00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,800
everything's changing the little dial

00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,270
was moving and all that it's see people

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,820
like yeah that's cute but I build

00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,380
enterprise apps trust me when you get to

00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,270
a point where there's a complex workflow

00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,280
or something you have to create that

00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:04,230
just kind of has to be mapped out or

00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,350
drawn or visualize differently than a

00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:09,000
list of stuff svgs are actually a good

00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,230
way to look at get accomplishing things

00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,410
that you might have to spend forever

00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:15,210
trying to do hacking away with CSS

00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:17,070
trying to make i'm going to put two

00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:20,430
borders on a box and make that look like

00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:21,900
a light now don't do it this is a cool

00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:24,270
one I don't know how this will show up

00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,700
here oh my phone is no longer giving me

00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:32,520
uh I was using my phone as a hotspot oh

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:33,690
well so snap SVG library highly

00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,400
recommend it anytime you got to start

00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,200
animating things d three if you've got

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,670
to build a tree or you got to build

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,500
anything out like that and you want to

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,180
keep a lot of things though when data is

00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,500
changing this

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,119
d3 is really good that why it's good at

00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,160
graphs and charts is because it will

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,569
bind to the data for you and will do

00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,460
your transforms and things like that but

00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:52,440
you're still going to be writing the

00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,839
SVG's you're still going to have to have

00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,849
knowledge in your mind about what SVG is

00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,950
really doing because it's not going to

00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:01,380
just magically do something for you from

00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:04,200
that point on when I got done doing the

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,269
project that it's launching next week it

00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,670
is in there it was a nightmare I'm

00:40:06,269 --> 00:40:09,630
smiling and all those other people are

00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,230
the ones that are probably going to have

00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:17,640
to support it i love them dearly my got

00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:20,940
great co-workers you're welcome but I

00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:23,279
will say this do not shy away from SVG I

00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,630
didn't realize how I guess you could say

00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:26,609
after all these years of being in the

00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:29,250
front end development since 98 99

00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:31,769
actually how crippled I was with not

00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,869
knowing how to use that tool and finding

00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:35,009
out being a JavaScript junkie it's just

00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:37,170
as easy to do it that way with the

00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:38,339
library but now I have like no problem

00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,559
saying if you want to make something

00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:41,609
crazy in an interface we can do it I

00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,019
don't have to sit here and figure out

00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:45,569
how am I going to do this with a bunch

00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:56,220
of div tags and some CSS so if anybody

00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:59,160
has any questions yeah yeah okay so 3d

00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,769
transformations don't with SVG don't hit

00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:05,400
the GPU yet from what I've seen I could

00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:07,369
be also old data that I dread to so

00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:12,569
that's the only that's the one thing I

00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:13,710
yes and I could possibly depends what I

00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:16,619
dread at what time you know what I mean

00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,509
that's I'll admit I am NOT your SVG

00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,609
expert I'm just relating a story and

00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:26,420
some things that I ran into to hope they

00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:26,420
help out yeah thanks yeah

00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,340
yes

00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,010
I would totally hack it that way and

00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,750
when I say heck it that way that's not

00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,520
an insult it's there they have a thing a

00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,290
concept called foreign object and you

00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,180
can read about that foreign objects not

00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:59,180
that well supported and a lot of the

00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,830
browsers and everything that I've seen

00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,140
as long as you understand when you're

00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,760
positioning your HTML element that all

00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,730
of a sudden your coordinate system is

00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,200
different within the SVG thing one of my

00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,120
first attempts with trying to build that

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,830
whole thing was to say all right D 3

00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,060
let's just rock the lines out for me I

00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,520
don't want to have to worry about it and

00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,840
I'm going to make will div with all the

00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,850
text everything and just lay them

00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,930
everywhere where it became a nightmare

00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,700
though was when those things would

00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:25,820
expand or collapse you're losing track

00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,680
of things too much to work on yeah you

00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,240
can you can totally do the overlay on

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,430
that but now you're going to have to

00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,440
think in two coordinate systems and when

00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:35,510
you something moves in the SVG remember

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,810
there's timing issues too if this was to

00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:40,790
move with it okay this runs and then the

00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,050
event the vent loops going to JavaScript

00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,070
wait oh you gotta run you know what I

00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,990
mean I got some things they're not going

00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:50,330
to run together sometimes you can get

00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:51,860
some janky stuff but static if it's just

00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:54,080
static like that and it doesn't move I

00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:57,470
have to do anything I absolutely why not

00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,970
it gets the job done and I mean that's

00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,010
what we got to do so yeah i would i

00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,780
would do that i would prefer to see i

00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,490
would always prefer to do that then you

00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,990
try and attempt to get those foreign

00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:08,210
object things to work and some of the

00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,290
other ways it's just I don't I can't

00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:13,210
spend that much time worrying about

00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:16,210
every single browser anymore so I am

00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,210
yeah

00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,530
so so now remember though there's a

00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:28,750
problem with h2o dom elements right if

00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,280
you change the opacity on something on a

00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:32,710
Dom element all its children's get it

00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,180
you know what I mean so if you have

00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,950
something wrapping the SVG I've never

00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:39,220
done that so I don't know but I would

00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,060
think it could possibly if it's wrapped

00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,280
around there and you change the opacity

00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,650
outside the SVG could do something there

00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,240
but as far as within their you can

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,470
overlay you're not going to HTML will

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,840
never be interacting with the SVG

00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:53,650
they'll be on their own worlds but when

00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,910
you overlay things on so if you don't

00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:56,440
want all the children or something to

00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,930
get an opacity you just want certain

00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,730
things to have different depths to it

00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,050
don't apply those styles to the graphic

00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:03,790
element or the g element which is the

00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,650
container you want to pass it right

00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:07,510
directly into what you want or group

00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:10,390
them because anything you apply will

00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:12,130
inherit that way and I and I that was a

00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:17,130
nightmare fight I had with a couple of

00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:19,870
things thanks a lot and I hope you join

00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:26,100
tomorrow flying drones with JavaScript

00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:26,100
