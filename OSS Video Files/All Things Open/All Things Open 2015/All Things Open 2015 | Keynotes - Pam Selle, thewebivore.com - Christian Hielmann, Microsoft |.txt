	00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,660
so I'm going to talk about jobs and

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,770
specifically how to get your next job as

00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:17,230
a developer so I'm Pam Sally I'm a

00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:20,020
software engineer I'm not a recruiter

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,610
I'm a technical person but I end up

00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,890
giving advice a lot to people looking

00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,990
for jobs and so I wanted to do a talk

00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:29,410
about kind of advice that i feel myself

00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:32,169
giving all over and over again in hopes

00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,699
that hey if i give a give a talk about

00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:36,520
it maybe more people will be able to

00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:38,260
hear about it I teach all people to

00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,519
program and I also run a user group in

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,620
Philadelphia with over a thousand

00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:43,449
members so I meet a lot of technical

00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,440
people and a lot of those techno people

00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:48,260
are often looking for jobs

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,519
so you might have heard especially with

00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,920
you know I understand this was mentioned

00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:54,230
in the documentary yesterday that that

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,809
we have a hiring problem we have a

00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,480
shortage of technical talent that you

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:04,850
know we we have a pipeline that needs to

00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:07,780
be filled or something and right but do

00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:10,009
we actually there's actually if you I

00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,430
really like this quote you can you can

00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:15,799
read it yourself but that there's not

00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,440
evidence of a shortage of technical

00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,330
talent there's evidence of people unable

00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,670
to find technical talent at the price

00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,530
that they're willing to pay and that's

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,060
not a shortage just like it's not a

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,840
problem that you couldn't find a half

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,690
price big-screen TV that's that's not

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,970
really a problem and in fact I actually

00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,409
looked into one of the studies that

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,380
someone was referencing of oh we have a

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:41,119
technical shortage and they if you look

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,619
at the study which you know I recommend

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,789
if someone says something said something

00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,979
you should look at the study then see

00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:48,560
what they actually did they asked

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:50,509
employers so I think if you say if you

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,360
ask seven year olds if broccoli was cool

00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:55,879
like maybe like they would say no does

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,960
that make broccoli not cool no I think

00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,700
broccoli is actually fantastic so

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,229
if you ask employers do we have a

00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,420
technical short as they say yes well

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:05,680
because I can't find a sysadmin who's

00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,130
willing to work for what I'm willing to

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,380
pay them that's not a shortage so if

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,890
there's not a shortage then what is the

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,110
problem well to explore that let's look

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,600
at what hiring actually looks like so

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,770
hiring is is difficult so people say is

00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,510
a lot but what what does it actually

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,310
looked like so let us explain this with

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,410
stick people where you will experience

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,590
my wonderful photoshop skills of stick

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,090
people so here our illustrious tick peel

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,090
will have Emily the employer on the

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:37,060
right and you know Alan the applicant on

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,100
the left so Alan the applicant hears

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,690
about Emily the employer or doesn't even

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,810
hear about they just wander into Emily

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,690
employers shop they say Emily I've heard

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,070
you have problems I've got solutions

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,660
lets you know I can work for you and

00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,580
everything will go great Emily hires

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,140
Alan everything goes fantastic right

00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,110
this is exactly how the hiring market

00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,040
works no not at all it looks a lot more

00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,870
like this so poor Emily especially with

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,670
the internet because I have some cheat

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,610
notes over here just to make sure I get

00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,760
everything

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,790
alright so now especially you know if

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,410
you you know on Main Street USA if you

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,910
walked into a shop there's a there's

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,710
kind of a physical limit to how many

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,890
people who can apply for a job maybe

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:22,860
with the internet you have it's

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,720
barely unlimited the amount of jobs that

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,400
people can apply to people who apply to

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,959
jobs by writing a letter about how much

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,580
their family needs them to get a job

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,770
which isn't really a way to get a job

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,920
but it is a great way to fill up

00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:37,020
someone's inbox and so not only does

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,520
Emily have this problem every employer

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,440
has this problem because all these

00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,930
applicants are measuring their success

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,760
in number of applications and so all of

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,150
them are inundated with all this noise

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,310
and so when there exists a problem in

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,560
the marketplace and if capitalism is

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,050
vaguely working there enter someone to

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,390
solve this problem and here's Robin the

00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,060
recruiter and so Robin the recruiters

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:03,000
have I got you those people are really

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,670
annoying you know asking to you know be

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,350
employed by you so I'm gonna help you

00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,420
with that and I'm going to do it for a

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,570
cool twenty to thirty thousand dollars

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,049
for many engineering positions it's

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:19,500
that's how much recruiters make to place

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:21,269
an engineer if I told you you can make

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,040
twenty two thousand thousand dollars by

00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,229
emailing random people and badgering

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,520
them on LinkedIn you two would probably

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,520
be tempted to become a recruiter

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,790
and furthermore that number goes up the

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,260
more rare and the more the more

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,419
difficult it is to find the person to

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,340
fill the role so recruiters are highly

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,980
incentivized in fact to go the other way

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,180
and so now we don't just have applicants

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,740
who are feeding to the recruiter and the

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,180
recruiter does their job we have the

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,100
recruiter Robin the recruiter is off

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,320
badgering everyone else and you know

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,970
saying hey do you wanna you know hey I

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,590
saw that you've done you know web

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,910
development it passed how about a you

00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,150
know network administrator position in

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,110
Arkansas so like that would make me

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,200
twenty thousand dollars that sounds

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,060
great uh and if actually you get these

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,280
all the time and so I'll forever regret

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,700
the 12 hours of my life that I ever have

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,320
my resume on dice com um because you

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,810
know all these recruiting firms have

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,030
databases full of people they've crawled

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,860
and of course also your email is often

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,419
just your your name so the even then

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,520
it's not that hard or worse engineer and

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,590
so you get a lot of these completely

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,300
worthless cold cow emails this is a

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,460
piece of garbage this piece of garbage

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,440
email it tells me absolutely nothing

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,120
about position doesn't even tell me who

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,040
therefore it's open to discussing a key

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,960
full-stack software engineering position

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,449
with our premier global client

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,860
uh and they've consistently been listed

00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:42,470
as one of the best places to work for

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,910
almost 20 continuous years all that

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,860
tells me is that the place has been open

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,120
for 20 years like that is literally the

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,870
only thing I would know about this

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,270
position and so you know schmuck at you

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,250
know global talent services since gets

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,690
to send me you know since me hundreds of

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,090
other people this cold email because of

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,009
just one of them if one of them gets

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,449
placed they get to see that money in the

00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,389
bank and that is where the incentive is

00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:08,120
so what the heck is going on so how do

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:11,240
we get like so so this makes sense for

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,910
somebody so we have more annoyance we

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,620
have more noise we have misplaced

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,050
incentive because those recruiters are

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,340
incentivized to be bad actors the

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,600
incentives are there for them to act

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,240
like that

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,430
so you have to ask who benefits Sookie

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,070
bono so who is benefiting from the

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,320
situation Emily the employer they're

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,880
just fine because Emily the employer has

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,160
paid people to deal with their problem

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,170
so Emily now doesn't have that annoying

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,510
full inbox of people you know begging

00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,370
for jobs and what have you and they have

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,570
outsourced out to a staffing firm the

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,570
staffing firm is happy because they're

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,650
getting lots of money so and even if

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,390
they aren't getting lots of money i know

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,250
that there's you know your frontline

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,080
recruiter often isn't well compensated

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,840
because they're kind of a burn and turn

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,760
amount of people there they're the

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,410
recruiting equivalent to canvassers on

00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,630
the street who are you know trying to

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,730
get you to sign up for Greenpeace the

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,620
people who they get compensated they

00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,210
have to send all that cold email they

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,860
don't know the market and if they get

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,960
just one then they can move out of that

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,110
position and if they don't meet their

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,780
quota they get let go

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,180
so the person who consistently losses in

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,030
this situation is a talent so only

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:23,230
person I didn't mention in that key bono

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:24,910
so how do we help the talent not get

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,120
sucked into this horrible position and

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,440
that is that is the challenge so the

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,200
challenge is that you have talent

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,130
getting tons of irrelevant leads is

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,630
difficult for talent to connect to

00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,370
employers if emily is filtering out

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,440
every single resume that comes into her

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,730
inbox and saying no I paid our crew to

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,200
deal with that how do you actually

00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,300
connect with employers when you are

00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,580
looking for a job and you're a talented

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,100
you know well-adjusted human being and

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,550
the interview process especially for

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:54,220
technical people is absolutely terrible

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,750
we asked technical people to prove every

00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,270
single time they've worked for a job

00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,860
that they're technical people this is

00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,580
not something that other industries

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,650
generally do

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,360
it's not written for a technical

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,990
interview to span about you know 10

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,610
hours of work like ten work hours if you

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,960
if you you know have you ever worked the

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,569
billable hour understand what I mean

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,490
that that is work hours that's not even

00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:19,759
including if you have to fly if you to

00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:23,240
travel to get that interview the cost of

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,740
of taking a day off work the emotional

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,479
cost of trying to pretend like you're

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,210
not looking for a job when it's really

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,630
obvious that you are that's very

00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:35,750
stressful so how do we deal with this so

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,760
I have so the reason for this is also i

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,190
have a dream is that I meet a lot of

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,829
engineers and technical people through

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,450
my networks who I I see there they're

00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:47,630
unhappy in the jobs that they have and

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,910
the majority of people in in at least

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,839
this country work for other people so as

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,730
much of there's a dream of

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,930
entrepreneurship not everyone has to be

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,760
an entrepreneur and in fact that's

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,950
probably not the best case scenario you

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
know if you're good at something you

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,190
should be able to find somewhere where

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,040
you can do that and work with others to

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,320
produce something a value and that might

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,690
look like a job for you so if that looks

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,579
like for a job a job for you I want you

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,360
to be able to find the best kind of job

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,649
where you can be happy and also this not

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,260
very secret agenda because I'm about to

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,030
tell you right now

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,160
is that I want people to stop working

00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,570
for terrible people so if you have a job

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,430
that is making you miserable and

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,890
especially if it's because you work with

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,590
miserable people I want their talent to

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:36,280
dry up

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:38,080
that's what I want so that is my agenda

00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,910
and how I'm going to tell you how to get

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,810
a job and how you can stop working for

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:46,660
those people ever again that is my goal

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:48,040
so there has to be a better way so I've

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,770
broken this down to my attempts to

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,770
codify into a three-step job hunt

00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:58,750
process and the spoiler is that this

00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:00,790
does not involve monster com so I can i

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,950
call it beyond the resume because i feel

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,350
like when people give career advice they

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:07,480
end up focusing on you know adding like

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,040
the most the most you know glitter and

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,170
cute animals or whatever you know the

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,300
femoral like metaphorical glitter to

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,880
your resume and your cover letter car

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,170
Boers are good but if your foot if

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,240
that's where you focus your energy and

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,400
if you measure a job hunt in number of

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,280
applications sent

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,840
you're gonna have a bad time and or at

00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,520
least this is what I found and that is

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,250
why is not my preferred way to look for

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,870
jobs I don't count I don't measure up

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,080
basement applications and in fact if I

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,160
sent out more than maybe even now I'm

00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,860
probably down into the single digits

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,590
when I'm looking for a job of places

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,120
that I'm talking to so if you break this

00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,540
down to the three steps is that you hunt

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,980
for targets you um I don't know the

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,660
people in the back can move the mouse

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,050
this annoys me when it's on people's

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:56,710
slides anyone else also obsessed with

00:10:53,050 --> 00:11:00,220
that but like the mouse anyway I love if

00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:02,170
you and move that so so you hunt for

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,250
targets you make the first contact and

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,590
then you nail the interview so these are

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,760
big buckets of steps and so this is kind

00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,170
of how you're going to flow through the

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:13,690
job process oh yeah

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,420
close close yeah all right we'll leave

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,810
it there that's good this guy's good um

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:23,079
so so we hunt for targets and so this

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,120
really smart person said this once that

00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,519
your chances of getting a job you want

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,350
vastly increase if you know what you

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,850
want in a job and so step zero before

00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,829
you even start your job process is

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,600
knowing what you want and if you don't

00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:38,500
know what you want and you you're asking

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,910
you know I don't know what do I want to

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,560
be when I grow up if you have a problem

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,149
in your past go to therapy if you're a

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:48,550
problem in your future go to coaching

00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:50,019
that's it all right so so in terms of if

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,880
you if you figured out the past and

00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:53,709
you're you know you have some things you

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,300
could do here's an exercise i recommend

00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:56,560
and this is if this were a workshop you

00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,089
could do right now if you're taking

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,370
notes on paper you could do it right now

00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:03,130
so make a list of all the things that

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,260
you can do so all the things that you

00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,630
know theoretically someone could pay you

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:10,720
or you know that people pay other people

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,959
money to do this skill could be you know

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,760
setting up servers sending up dns

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,800
building a simple wordpress website

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,199
building a complex wordpress website

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,240
whatever skills and enumerate those

00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,649
skills and then next to the skills

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,240
you're going to make some notes

00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:26,949
and you're going to put notes next to

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,220
the ones that you don't like doing and

00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:32,560
then you will never do them again

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,690
that's the radical thing so within your

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,030
power figure out the things that you do

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,130
that you don't like doing and then stop

00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,430
doing them this is a really concrete

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:45,550
path to happiness stop doing things you

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:47,530
don't like and in addition you know go

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,210
through and put things next to the stars

00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,800
next to the things you enjoy and the

00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,230
things you want to do more of things you

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,940
want to spend your time on figure out

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,650
how to focus your energy on those things

00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,240
and that'll give you some hints of where

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,400
you what you want to look for your next

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,260
job I feel like especially the job hunt

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,150
process is way to focus on what we've

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,130
done and not on what we will do and

00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,260
that's how you're going to move that

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,450
conversation is to think about those

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,140
things that you can do that you want to

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,140
be doing more of

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,470
and then once you know that you look for

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,780
places places that need people with your

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,330
skills that's hunting for target so

00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,340
looking for places that need those

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,680
skills places that you're interested in

00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,880
especially if you know we have technical

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,180
skills you can focus on a particular

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,650
industry of you know like it seems like

00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,910
everyone's a tech company now bank of

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,230
america is a tech company they all

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,700
consider themselves tech companies but

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,220
really it's that every industry needs

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,930
people with technical skills so think

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:45,220
about where you can be an interested

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:48,190
person working for for another person so

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:50,830
and when you're finding targets you talk

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,750
to people you talk to other people and

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,580
you go to the watering hole so what I

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,210
mean by that is you talk to your people

00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:00,250
so meaning is so surprising how rarely

00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,510
this happens that when you were looking

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,610
for when you were thinking about looking

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,760
for job or looking for a job tell your

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,620
close contacts so that's your people and

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,000
then after you've done that and you've

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,800
gotten over that hump and you've kind of

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,270
practice saying like hi you know you

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,770
know oh yeah I'm looking for this thing

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,170
and this is what I want to do and this

00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,750
is what I'm focusing on talk to people

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,760
who you know less well we think about is

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,410
that kind of if there's like a circle of

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,870
your network as budging that circle

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:29,230
creating bumps in the circle and those

00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:31,270
loose connections actually statistically

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,640
end up being your best bets for finding

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,990
a job because you know it makes sense if

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,130
you think about it you know about the

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,690
world that your close friends already

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,950
know about you don't know about the

00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,209
world about the person you know a little

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,160
less well

00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:45,490
and then go to the watering hole so that

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,929
tip is to look in places if you're just

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,160
looking for a list of companies to say

00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,540
I'm going to look at these people look

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,649
at the conference sponsor list and I you

00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,149
know I'm not just saying that because

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:55,209
I'm on stage at a conference I actually

00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:57,220
do mean that that when companies sponsor

00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:59,079
conference especially now in this high

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,759
ring market often they're sending a

00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,819
signal that they're they're looking for

00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,279
people so they actually have had the

00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,389
open positions off often there's even I

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:11,040
don't know if you all know but there's a

00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:14,259
job board downstairs so you can go look

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,089
and of course you know i highly

00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:17,920
recommend because when people sponsor or

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:20,199
when they support the communities such

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,939
as through user groups or they show up

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,800
at community forums like your regional

00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:25,420
tech meetup and events they're sending

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,160
out signals that this is the kind of

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,230
thing that they're into which means that

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,760
you all connect on a values level which

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:34,010
is a really important thing

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,870
so after you've found some targets you

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,080
might have already made first contact so

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,400
first contact is that first conversation

00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,680
because what you want to do is exchange

00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,990
the application process from we aren't

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,180
measuring in applications anymore the

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,890
cover letter and resume combo sent to

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,400
the ignored email folder is a losing

00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,470
game

00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,790
exchange it for a conversation because

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,970
you're a real person in there real

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:59,310
people so you want to have a real

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:02,490
conversation with people about what

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:04,620
their needs are first and then see if

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,260
there's a skill match for what you can

00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,300
do it's about a mutual agreement really

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,530
the when we talk when people talk about

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,780
job hunting they talk about the

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,520
negotiation process the negotiation

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,040
process starts from the beginning it

00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,690
starts from that first conversation

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,490
negotiation is just a mutual agreement

00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,990
between two parties and in this case

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,770
it's the mutual agreement that you would

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:27,900
be successful in a job there and so this

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:29,940
is when you get into the it's it's also

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,640
a little bit of a power thing is that

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,080
instead of you asking for a job you're

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,360
looking for a mutual agreement where you

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,730
can help each other and that changes the

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,160
conversation here's some example things

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,390
you might say if you are talking to

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,040
someone and trying to make that first

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,170
contact if you haven't already made it

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,300
by talking to someone at a networking

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,740
event it's not uncommon if you're at a

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,470
networking event or talking to a close

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,180
contact you say hey I want to do x y&z

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,310
do you does that sound like anyone you

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,230
know and they'll say well that sounds

00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,430
like my company let me you know like put

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,010
you at the top of the list and then you

00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,320
have a job like days later um so you

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,420
have to you if that's not what you want

00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,740
to happen you you might have to put some

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,780
brakes on that oh

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,429
let's say you have a company and you're

00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,980
trying to make contact this is this is

00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:15,179
also common so you say hey so someone

about a role there what's the best way

00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,490

didn't then you didn't do your homework

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,840
but you're asking what's the best way to

00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:36,450
do that and if they send you to the jobs

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,650

thanks yeah I did check out the page who

00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:44,970
could I talk to so getting to getting to

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,220
a human being like do you remember when

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,330
I used to be those apps to that you

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,710
could put in a phone number and it would

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,780
route through the phone tree for you I

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,059
miss those if you have one that still

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,320
works please send it to me but that's

00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,700
kind of what you're doing you're working

00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,380
on getting to a human being and having a

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,150
real conversation about what they need

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,190
and what you can do

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,920
if you don't know anyone's a company

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,690
here's how you find someone you ask so

00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,040
you talk to people talk to your people

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,720
talk to other people and Pam interest in

00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,190
this company can I talk to you about

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,560
what it's like to work there because I

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,090
also say if you're doing a cold

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,500
introduction to a company and you don't

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,620
know what it's like to work there at all

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,330
I ask why your interest in that company

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,530
because if you have no I if you have

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,850
some vague idea what they do but you

00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,590
don't know what it's actually like to do

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,610
the work on the day-to-day you actually

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,350
have no idea what it's like to work

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,279
there and so it behooves you to actually

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,840
find that out

00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,249
alright and so the interview there's

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,739
actually lots of things I can say about

00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:38,080
the interviews not surprisingly you know

00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:40,359
number one ranting about them but i'll

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,309
leave you with two tips so just just two

00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,559
things i can say about how to do well in

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,440
in views so number one is the biggest

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,019
mistake you can make it a job interview

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,559
for the love of God do not name a number

00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:55,809
first this is my common the the most

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,629
commonly given piece of advice I give

00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:00,669
and people continue not to take it and

00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:02,889
the reason is because that job

00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:04,960
conversation process is a negotiation

00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:05,979
all the way through so when you say name

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,570
and number first I don't necessarily

00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,219
mean at the end when you're talking

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,839
about the compensation package that

00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:12,820
might be a good time to have a number

00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:14,349
conversation I mean at the very

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,700
beginning that's when you have the least

00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:18,029
information about each other and this

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,859
the worst time to name a number

00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:22,019
and then how to answer any interview

00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:24,570
question I'm running at time but the

00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:27,539
answer is to tell a story and when in

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,909
doubt stop talking so how to answer any

00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:31,289
interview question is when you respond

00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:33,349
on interview question have a beginning a

00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:36,570
middle and an end and then stop talking

00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:39,599
because silence is very powerful and

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,219
especially if you listen and you know

00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,859
you know the saying about two years in

00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:45,450
one mouth if you listen people will tell

00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:46,710
you you know oh this is something my

00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,539
companies and you'll learn a lot more

00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,580
about them and see if you're a good fit

00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:52,769
there all right if you want more i'm

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,450
actually working on a book it's an alpha

00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,249
which means that it's you can watch

00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,589
wireless being written it's on gift

00:19:56,249 --> 00:20:00,899
books i can tweet it out and thank you

00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:02,669

thanks excellent these are my slides is

00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:12,210
my microphone we're there hey hello okay

00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:13,950
I want to get a bit more philosophical

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,299
than in my normal talks I'm normally

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,359
giving technical talks with lots of

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:20,099
fluffy animals and I thought today I

00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,869
want to take the opportunity here to

00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:23,879
talk about some gaps that I find in the

00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:25,589
market as a bit of a background I work

00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:27,599
for Microsoft now as a program manager i

00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:30,690
was in mozilla until half a year ago I

00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:34,320
was in yahoo before i was at 42

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,960
conferences in 27 countries last year so

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,119
I spoke I gave a single a new talk at

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,349
every one of them cater talk to the

00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,179
conference got to know different

00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:44,230
audiences and I have a quite a good

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:48,060
inside of what we're doing here

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:51,330
and this clicker isn't working

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,630
hello can you move on the clicker isn't

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,630
working

00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:00,530
don't don't okay the web isn't good for

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:04,010
us the web has been this wonderful thing

00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:05,840
that we have gotten as a gift it's

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,430
independent of hardware it's independent

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,340
of software it's independent of ability

00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,900
and location and we all would not be

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,070
here if the internet didn't exist first

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,260
of all we wouldn't have learned about

00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,540
this conference second of all we

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,820
probably wouldn't have had a job I

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,650
started my first website 996 I worked as

00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,120
a radio journalist back then and I

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,130
realized that everybody in radio over

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,890
the age of 30 is an alcoholic or unhappy

00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,570
or both so I thought I'd use the

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,940
internet where I can publish worldwide

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,340
without any problems and people can

00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,310
actually reach my stuff and I wanted to

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,860
give my whole energy to keeping this

00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:44,440
open wonderful thing alive and I've done

00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,440
that the last few years people phone

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:51,539
it's gonna be awful yeah

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,250
now it's an amazing yeah we have to I

00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,530
have to wave for something so you have

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,510
to move to the next one it's an amazing

00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:01,880
idea in an offer if we got access to

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:04,140
information worldwide 24-7 move on

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,260
just show them all

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,880
we're independent of hardware stop

00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,980
independent of hardware software ability

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,100
and geographical location and it's a

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,200
retried medium everybody invited on the

00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,900
web is invited to become a publisher and

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,720
not only a consumer and we forgotten

00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,640
this people had blocks people had like

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,380
their own little websites people even

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,640
had a geocities sites which of course

00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:31,380
was a void idea of what creativity is be

00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,170
meant to be and what beautiful phones

00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,990
mean but we had them we did them

00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:39,150
nowadays we send each other little

00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:42,030
screen shots of TV shows and think this

00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:44,370
is humorous weary Georgia Tate what the

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,080
mainstream media does for us and put it

00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,300
on the web and consider it the new media

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,700
we forgotten that we have a voice on the

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,560
web that nobody can control or tries to

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,750
all the time but fails all the time and

00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,980
in some places this means the only voice

00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:59,520
that they have that the government

00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,760
controls from them move on because one

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,760
person's beauty is in other ones worry

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,650
move on three of them

00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,080
it's hard to build software and

00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,880
interfaces for the unknown it's like

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,650
people love to build things falling on

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,390
I've got my computer with my build

00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,800
script with that much RAM and this

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,780
resolution I can build a great

00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,700
application on the web you have no idea

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,040
what people are using you have no right

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,380
to control what people are using and for

00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,230
most developers this sounds weird but I

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,820
love it I love that challenge I love not

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,350
knowing what my end users are doing

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,930
because they come up with use cases that

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,050
I don't know and I want to build 40

00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:37,700
unknown I don't want to build for one

00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:39,770
operating system in one mobile phone it

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,170
costs a lot of money in one country this

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,240
is boring this is terrible I want to I

00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,190
want to build for the world open

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,050
distribution caching and availability of

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,910
source code is anathema to content

00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:52,220
providers when I talked about html5

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,800
games on Firefox OS there it was like my

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,660
god people couldn't see my source code

00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,830
yeah you change your game every week so

00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,080
they have to steal your source code

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,000
every weekend code along with you this

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,520
is not the way to protect your stuff

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,050
dude people will take you things away

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,640
but photographers were always coming up

00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,350
to me like how can I protect my photos

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,000
online well put them on a memory stick

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,250
leave them in your leave them on your

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,380
desk don't put them online because

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,390
online i can make a screenshot i love

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,640
that itunes for example doesn't allow me

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,720
to take screenshots of movies you know

00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,650
you tried to make a screenshot of a

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,600
movie and you got like a checkerboard

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,670
instead of the set of the frame of the

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,200
movie do they think that you shoot a

00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,490
movie frame by frame and then stitch it

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,610
together again and make a pirated copy

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,890
or why is that

00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,450
you know I love finding it mistakes in

00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,770
movies and making screenshots of that

00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,620
and people would probably watched a

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,410
movie after i send it out on twitter we

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,720
forgot to find a way to monetize the web

00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:45,070
though it was all hippy technol hippie

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,290
horseshit in the beginning if you think

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,910
about it it's like let's distribute

00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,290
everything worldwide everybody's free

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,670
everybody shares nobody wants to make

00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,740
money with that everybody's going to pay

00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:55,210
us because we're awesome and then we

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,980
went to the only thing we had which was

00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,290
advertising which was 400 years old

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,510
again already at that time and then we

00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:04,620
put it on the web and out of a sudden we

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:06,630
realized something is not working

00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,750
excellent

00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,470
we broke the web

00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:14,770
we absolutely and utterly broke the web

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,770
we move on

00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,590
hmm

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:35,320
15 seconds

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:38,700
this is the average time a page needs to

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,559
load nowadays on a normal connection

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,029
these are 15 awkward seconds and I felt

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,900
like a complete ass right now and you

00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:45,900
will like what's going on

00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:52,730
and this is if you go on this is a

00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,890
research that they just found out a 15

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,799
seconds is how long it takes the page to

00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,030
be interactive in 5.5 seconds is how

00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,790
long it takes to load and it's the

00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:03,620
median page this is not the worst ones

00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:06,020
out there the worst ones are like up to

00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,179
30 50 whatever minutes these kind of

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,700
things it's two megabyte in size and

00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:12,710
contains 170 resources that's like

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,049
saying we didn't do any performance

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,750
talks or trainings or anything ever in

00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:19,070
the last five years most sites fail to

00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,630
take advantage of core image

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,309
optimization techniques people just

00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:25,100
upload massive images sometimes raw

00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:26,990
images or bitmap files and you're like

00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,549
oh god this is terrible and it could oh

00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,650
god we got an iPad we got to have two

00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:32,390
retina display of the of our bosses

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,490
picture instead of just making people

00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,770
give you access to the service your

00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,940
website provides and most sites to fail

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,220
take advantage of Corey mature

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,290
optimization techniques and the biggest

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:45,080
problem is a lot of times advertising

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:47,059
and social button little libraries

00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,980
things that we put in the page because

00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:51,980
they're easier to use with javascript

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,870
HTML CSS would never block would never

00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,179
block the loading and the interaction

00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:58,809
JavaScript into a blocks the interaction

00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:01,889
when we do it wrong

00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:01,889
so what can we do

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:09,000
we have the technology we can patch it

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,000
Adblock Plus

00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,500
everybody here is probably using a drug

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,120
class because we're clever may not these

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,640
stupid people that click on ads you know

00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,090
the ones that pay our wages

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,840
you know adblock plus Chris got bought

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:25,640
by an investor an unknown investor you

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,650
know it's not it's not anywhere known

00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,420
and nobody knows who bought them could

00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,180
be the Russian mafia could be like the

00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,669
Triads could be like Yakuza or worse fox

00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,889
news you know

00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:38,659
it's we've thought we're clever we're

00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:40,820
blocking the internet making our

00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:43,190
internet better and by that we just made

00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,320
advertising more aggressive and that's

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,539
the problem with that the more you block

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,399
the more aggressive to get and then we

00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:51,320
find other technical solutions for that

00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:54,440
problem we have for example Facebook

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,139
instant articles or we have Google's am

00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:01,009
project the accelerated mobile pages or

00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:03,139
we have apple news all of these things

00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:05,119
are great technology solutions all of

00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,919
these things solve the problem of

00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,559
advertising being too slow especially

00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:12,889
amp it's open source it's an isight here

00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:15,440
it's a bit like a mixture of web and RSS

00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:17,389
and it gives us like the three seconds

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,929
60 frames per second things that we want

00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:23,869
to have but the problem is it replaces

00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:26,029
the open web it is an alternative view

00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:28,100
of the content that should be on the

00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:30,049
bloody internet they want to reach

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,609
millions of people but then they showed

00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:33,320
him too many ads so people get annoyed

00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:35,359
so we should solve the problem of

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,909
showing too many ads finding better ways

00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,799
to monetize finding better ways to make

00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:41,330
money on the web and allow us to show us

00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,799
advertising that makes sense and not

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,960
it's just like the things we never want

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,309
to see I don't understand how facebook

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,989
shows me some of the ads that I see

00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,609
where I'm like I'm a fashionable person

00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:51,109
I would pay money for a nice clothing

00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:53,629
but they show me things that I just want

00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:55,009
to scratch my eyes out and then button

00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:56,809
like Oh didn't you like that ad yeah I

00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:59,239
want to click on every at not that I

00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:01,639
didn't like it you know and all of these

00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:03,200
things are open yes fair enough but

00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,690
they're still maintained by one company

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,789
and this is not what the web is about I

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,320
don't want to publish where one company

00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,850
controls what I'm doing I don't want to

00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,559
publish what one government controls

00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:16,090
what I'm doing I want to publish on the

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,090
bloody Internet I want to be out there

00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,950
power applied in a crooked way mrs.

00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,510
indigo parking garage in the Indy

00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:25,800
microsoft office I didn't find any

00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,800
pictures or just took a lot of them

00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:30,309
we take the power of controlling the

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,330
internet and we push people into

00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:36,309
channels that we control does in Africa

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,990
as places where I've been where people

00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:39,160
think Facebook is the internet because

00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,510
the only thing they can reach us

00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,179
facebook cuz there's phones that have

00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:45,190
facebook pre-compiled on it and no other

00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:47,410
access to any other website the only

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,270
access facebook the excess facebook the

00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,530
instant through the facebook browser so

00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,170
there's a lot of opportunity to

00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,570
basically block things to take political

00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:57,929
statements out to get it to basically

00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:00,149
cut down on people's freedom of speech

00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,649
and this is the only way that people can

00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:04,480
internet can access the internet so

00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:07,090
people control it that way we move on

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,860
there's a disconnect this is like my my

00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,600
street when I get into in London and

00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,280
quite fun because I only cycles oh I

00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,169
don't care but everybody who try to

00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,380
coast tries to get to be by car is

00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:19,660
basically connected their development is

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,090
still seen as magic

00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,350
and that's what my mom would never

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,970
understand what I'm doing you know I

00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,920
wrote a book so she has something

00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:29,420
physical to show people so chic stops

00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,390
calling me

00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,620
and people find internet find problems

00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:35,630
on the internet and always blame

00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,910
themselves I mean in user testing you

00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:39,590
see database errors and people say like

00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,880
oh dust have done something wrong you

00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,440
cannot do anything wrong to cause a

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,120
database error unless you do a sequel

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,220
injection or something like that which

00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,320
is then the technical people again but

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,120
people seem see is still as magic and

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,280
don't understand a bit of scared of it

00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,380
and don't want to talk to us and we on

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,480
the other hand we internalize that we

00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,770
realize we're not social people it was

00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,240
quite fun when github came up where a

00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:02,480
social network for developers what good

00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,500
luck with that but worked out really

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,140
well if you're gone

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,750
and is Magic mighty I've been into harry

00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,370
potter studios as you can see is Magic

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,980
Mart its technology something we should

00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,380
use to to cut down on people's

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,240
technology access like building and

00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,190
better faster internet rather than

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,560
talking to the ad providers and say like

00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:26,470
okay your ads a how about we make

00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,850
them better you know instead of instead

00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,050
we come up with better solutions better

00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,420
technical solution we do that as

00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:33,640
developers as well

00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,530
we're spoiled for choice and connected

00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,510
as developers this is me debugging's on

00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,520
Firefox devices at home and I got an iOS

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:42,460
device there I got five mobile phones

00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,200
I've got extra hard drives I've got my

00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,410
laptop I've got all these cool things

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,510
I'm connected 24 7 and I use it to send

00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,220
cat pictures to each other and in the

00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,500
past people were like some people would

00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,910
kill for internet access and we just get

00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,410
very tired of when it's not really fast

00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,480
because we're in another country or

00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,280
something like that you find cafes where

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,840
they do laptop free zones now they don't

00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,950
allow you to bring your laptop because

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,840
everybody goes in there and works

00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,010
ourselves Facebook or something like

00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,180
that instead of buying coffee and

00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,860
getting out again and having

00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,240
conversations with other people while

00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,349
they do but over the Internet not in the

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,479
cafe

00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:17,399
we have one-track minds we find a

00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:19,679
technical solution for something that is

00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:21,149
sweet and we want to do it and we will

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,279
find a technical solution for everything

00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:25,049
instead of a social solution instead of

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,869
understanding that the internet cannot

00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:29,999
be free anymore we want everything on

00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:31,709
the internet to be free everything to be

00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:33,659
available and nobody should pay for

00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:34,889
anything this doesn't work there's an

00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,239
old saying that the only thing that's

00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:39,419
free is death and that cost your life

00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:41,399
and other than that everything will cost

00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:43,379
some money somewhere so the whole idea

00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:46,349
of us wanting everything for free on the

00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:47,639
internet is as stupid as the advertiser

00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:49,739
saying you have to pay for everything

00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:51,719
and we find technical solution for

00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:54,779
everything in open technology and in

00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:56,639
JavaScript as well and we have fancy

00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:59,039
beautiful things we got these bodies

00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:01,859
macbook pros we've got these remote

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,659
controls that work we've got mobile

00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:05,429
phones that have several cores in them

00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:07,829
we've got we've got internet

00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:09,989
connectivity when I was in Sweden had

00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:11,999
four gigabit at home in London I've got

00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:14,399
a 250 megabit for thirty dollars a month

00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:16,409
and that's just you know amazing when I

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,569
haven't had my first 56k connection but

00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:20,009
really I would like nobody will ever

00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:21,539
need something faster and then I see

00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:23,129
this now and then like oh my god it's so

00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:24,830
slow it takes like two hours to get a

00:33:23,129 --> 00:33:26,600
video and

00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,130
we have our tooling as well we've got

00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,840
JavaScript libraries we've got build

00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,880
blocks we've got building tools we've

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,559
got our IDEs we have all these beautiful

00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,970
things that we want to use and we're

00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:40,190
very very excited about and we pluck

00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,380
more of more and more and more of them

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,970
in we put a javascript library in there

00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,799
to make sure that Internet Explorer 8 is

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,899
not bad anymore then we put another in

00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:50,000
there so we can actually use local

00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:51,409
storage right now across devices then we

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,750
put another one in there that we make

00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:55,519
CSS animations in javascript because as

00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,990
animation or supported by everybody and

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,740
we put more and more and more more

00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,020
things on the web

00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,150
and it works but it is flimsy because

00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,130
lots of small fixes take up a large

00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:07,230
space as well the more libraries we use

00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:09,330
the more helper tools we use the more we

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:12,030
make our stack more complex to reach a

00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:14,730
website that makes up those two megabyte

00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:16,350
that makes up those 115 resources and

00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,230
all of it because of developer

00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:21,109
convenience

00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:23,960
we should avoid complexity this is the

00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:26,810
toilet in the in the Japanese lounge in

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:30,230
Frankfurt and this is the instructions

00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:31,609
how to use the bathroom and it kind of

00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,169
when I go on the web right now and I

00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:34,790
want to learn JavaScript it's feels a

00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:36,770
bit like that as well people like I go

00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,690
to the terminal install this mpm module

00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:40,220
with that compiler and that note install

00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,970
and then you can write a HelloWorld in

00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,040
Java Script

00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:48,109
because it's more effective and we have

00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,089
better tools get tooling

00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:52,099
so if you scroll this through this is a

00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:54,859
checklist of new or of starting a new

00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:56,869
open javascript library these are all

00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,339
the steps that you have to do you know

00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:00,380
if I started JavaScript nowadays I

00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:02,450
probably wouldn't do it I see job

00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,160
interview questions after written eight

00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:05,779
JavaScript books and working on three

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,239
browsers I wouldn't be able to answer

00:35:05,779 --> 00:35:10,309
those things we get very excited we make

00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,049
technology a religion and we make with

00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:13,940
all the dogma and the fighting that

00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:15,589
comes with that and we get very excited

00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,299
about May pretty more more complex

00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:19,489
things in there because more tools make

00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:20,869
us more effective maybe if we build

00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:24,759
simpler things we wouldn't need that

00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,759
many tools and people would be happier

00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,550
complexity is scary this is my dentist

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,730
in London and I don't know why I'm going

00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,730
there

00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,660
but yeah when I tell people you need

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,940
these 15 steps to write your first

00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,680
JavaScript people are going to go to iOS

00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,270
and be happy in their little closed

00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,410
world and where everything works for

00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,300
them and they make money immediately

00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,829
because everybody on iOS spends a lot of

00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,150
money on your app and you will be

00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:53,800
successful in a millionaire in three

00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,800
days that's the pitch I guess

00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:59,320
but people are scared of it the web we

00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,510
deserve and that open web that idea of

00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,970
Tim berners-lee that the beautiful web

00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:06,099
is not here yet and we gave it up we

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,740
turned the web into a lifestyle magazine

00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:10,730
that spies on us and we made it our

00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,820
image which is obese

00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:15,530
and lazy we know we put the same layouts

00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,820
everywhere and we put the recall it like

00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,980
a parallax thing that's the new thing

00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,150
this month no next month it has to look

00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,260
like that everything looks like

00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,790
bootstrap and then we call the

00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:26,230
innovation in the footer we put like

00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:26,230
made with love in this in this city

00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,780
lady I worked exclusively in fixing one

00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:39,100
massive issue for the web killing

00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:40,810
internet explorer that's what that's

00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,580
what Microsoft promised me and we're on

00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:44,890
the way Microsoft edges the outer box

00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,300
browser it's a evergreen browser it's a

00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,800
wonderful browser much like in

00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,930
comparison with all the others that we

00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,290
have out there and then we realize we

00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:55,270
messed up we built a browser with html5

00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:56,770
engine that supports he is 6 that does

00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,530
everything right and then we send it out

00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:01,120
on the web and we got this we got a

00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,370
version for Safari we got a version for

00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,230
Firefox and edge got the internet

00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:07,000
explorer 6 experience which is the

00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:10,990
please kill yourself before you find a

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,900
button experience because people test

00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,190
for browsers they test if it's a safari

00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,810
and then they give you a wonderful

00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,870
experience and everything else gets a

00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:22,780
terrible experience we as developers

00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:25,120
messed this up terribly we had to put so

00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,960
many aliases into the browser same in

00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,860
chrome same in firefox that actually

00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,900
experimental technology is a fire that

00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,340
wasn't finished yet had to be repeated

00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,350
in all the other browsers not to break

00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,760
the web and that makes the web slow as

00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:39,220
well because people use experimental

00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,620
technology in production experimental

00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,570
means experimental that's when people

00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:48,330
die and poisonous gases come out of

00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:48,330
things don't put them in production

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,490
it's 2015 and it's still all about

00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,390
browsers this is the Mozilla office in

00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,390
Toronto it's quite fun

00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,800
we still thinking in browsers I now talk

00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,330
about people about a generic edge is

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,940
compatible to other browsers

00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,320
compatibility is the idea and you don't

00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,760
need to know about the browser any

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,380
longer if you write for Chrome it runs

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,290
an edge and everybody's like oh can I

00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,060
get edge for OS X as well I want to have

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,130
every browser on my computer browsers

00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,140
should not be the case anymore browser

00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:20,780
should compete on the interface not on

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,520
the engine and we still think like Oh be

00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,050
built for browsers we could be check if

00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,670
it's one browser or another and we give

00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,290
you different environments check for

00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,240
capabilities don't test for browsers

00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:31,310
please and if you do test for browsers

00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,410
assume that unknown browsers are good

00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,760
and not terrible because otherwise you

00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,560
bring new browsers always the first

00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,270
terrible experience and then people go

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,410
to native apps instead

00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:43,299
compatibility is the main point that

00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:44,920
we're doing here and every browser is

00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:47,319
doing the same thing chrome is very much

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,059
on the case Firefox as well Safari the

00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:51,520
Safari team are lovely people that just

00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:53,200
not allowed to speak in public do you

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,180
don't see them at events much but they

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,470
have lots of good stuff in there and i

00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,089
love this like are we know testing

00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,680
against edge there's a bug threat no

00:38:58,089 --> 00:39:01,329
backtracked against it well we're

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,760
testing but there's no bug found because

00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:06,369
we built the thing compatible so don't

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,380
worry about edge worry about standards

00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:10,900
worry about using YouTube new technology

00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,970
new functionality its decision time

00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,119
right now and there is no maybe there's

00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:17,890
a yes or a No and I think it's time we

00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,750
stood up and fought for the open web

00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:21,970
that was so good for us and make sure

00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,770
that we don't lose it trying to match

00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,140
closed environments with open is

00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,910
exhausting we cannot match what an iOS

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,440
does because an iOS is done for one

00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,809
operating system on one piece of

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,490
hardware in one distribution model they

00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:35,740
control everything trying to match that

00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:38,549
with an open thing means you make a bad

00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,549
open thing

00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:44,039
technology is a journey it's not that we

00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:45,809
have right now a state of mind you have

00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,539
to be open to new changes all the time

00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:50,969
and I'm losing a lot I me because my

00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:54,680
can't click but that's why I'm commerce

00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:57,860
over time can we were fun Dinda journey

00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,390
so let's analyze and clean up this is a

00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,610
scanner that you can run through your

00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:03,800
website right now that tells you where

00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,050
you're doing things wrong where you're

00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,970
testing for one browser only where

00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,320
you're using accessibility the wrong way

00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,790
where you don't have alternative text

00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,770
for images where you have videos without

00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:15,650
a transcription where you have problems

00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:19,510
in usability of your users out there so

00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:19,510
if we move on put the web on a diet

00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:24,200
one outdated library at a time find

00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:26,180
those old libraries with that scanner

00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,790
tool and replace them with the newest

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,890
ones and half a process to keep them up

00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:32,810
to date because old browser library's

00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,640
old helper libraries are landfill of the

00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:36,770
web and they stop us from innovating

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,330
browsers and making them better thing

00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,280
uses an interface is first and

00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,570
technology second these are the

00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,240
guidelines of the government right now

00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:47,790
the US government has design guidelines

00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,369
and these will be enforced in government

00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:52,110
websites thank you I don't want to see

00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:55,440
these things that look like SharePoint

00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:56,730
dropouts from 1997 I want to see

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,770
beautiful things and I want to space

00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:01,619
them a bootstrapped us as good CSS as

00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,749
good JavaScript all the things in

00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,190
humans are better than machines we all

00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:06,599
about machine learning and cool things

00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,339
outlook told me the other day that it

00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,249
can be only one instance of lunch at a

00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:13,980
day that's not how humans work I mean

00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:15,660
seriously or when you got these robots

00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,829
where they make themself walking robots

00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,819
and you always kick them to prove how

00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:21,480
good they are they're gonna remember

00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:23,430
that when the robot takeover is going to

00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,060
happen Dec on a CDS footage and come up

00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:28,040
to us and say do you see what you did

00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,870
we will never have full control over our

00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,720
users and that's great that's how the

00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:35,240
web was defined this is how we built the

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,980
web the next challenge is not in coffee

00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,900
shops in San Francisco it's not the kids

00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,840
with the coolest newest iPad that just

00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:45,340
came out this part of the world this

00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,340
part of the world that we just got away

00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:50,160
is where everything happens every single

00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:52,770
one of these countries has a positive

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,089
GDP has more money than we have here

00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,800
right now and real money not the money

00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:57,540
to dissent to each other in the Silicon

00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,309
Valley to companies these are also

00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,740
billions and billions of people they are

00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:03,210
not online yet but they will come online

00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:06,480
and they will be important to us and

00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:09,180
they will need websites that work simple

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,579
ones HTML CSS a bit of travel script

00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,680
after testing that it can be applied not

00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,030
like here is a spinner for 15 seconds

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,270
because I want to show you a parallax

00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:19,740
page say its state of the browser Bruce

00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,119
Lawson in London gave a really good talk

00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,559
about this if you want to look through

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,690
that these slides are available online

00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,760
already as well there's lots of

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:28,230
information on this about where the next

00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,089
growth of the internet is happening and

00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:32,069
it's not where we are it's not with the

00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,809
technology that we use it's a new

00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:35,339
beautiful wonderful challenge of

00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:37,410
thousands and millions of voices that

00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:39,059
want to go online and can go online if

00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:40,440
we help them if we block them out and

00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:43,640
tell them not available in your country

00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,790
we're not better than the film industry

00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:48,230
let's make what we can control better

00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:51,140
let's make the websites that we have out

00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,490
there better and cleaner developers and

00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,170
browser maker should be friends not

00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:56,030
competitors we should not build

00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,620
JavaScript libraries to fix browser

00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:59,750
technology that's not in browsers yet

00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,180
that is stupid that is a waste of time

00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:04,190
because every browser maker now is open

00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,320
to innovation and open to discussion

00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,360
even we have a Twitter account in we

00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,640
have code on github and that's the evil

00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,680
death star from the past we're all

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,410
available for you to talk to and we need

00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,870
your information to build good things

00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,240
browsers are the outlines and the tools

00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:22,760
it's your job to color them in it's your

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,160
job to use your technology to build

00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,800
proper things with them and build things

00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,930
for capabilities not for browsers

00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,990
themselves

00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:35,630
please go and make a better web

00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,490
this is really cool analyze the speed of

00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,860
your product webpagetest or gives you a

00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:42,080
video of how bad your website performs

00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,330
it gives you like a checklist to go

00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,950
through what you can fix stop trying to

00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,660
guess what a browser is and use and

00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:50,990
assume unknown browsers to be good not

00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:53,090
terrible user agent sniffing is useless

00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:55,250
these things are unreadable it's a pack

00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:57,110
of lies is to user agent string as we

00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,000
called it keep up to date with what

00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,680
browsers can do can I use calm is a

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,570
great website to show you what is

00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,670
currently in browsers and try using it

00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,369
play with it use it for your good find

00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:08,990
user interface designs that need them

00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:11,700
and not just like or I want to use it

00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:14,310
because I want to use it

00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,430
file box report issues and talk to us

00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,990
the buck reported to directly to the

00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:21,720
browser makers is the one that gets

00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:24,300
fixed the bug reported on Twitter causes

00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,980
a hailstorm of people and like

00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,410
pitchforks and fire and stuff but

00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,890
nothing comes out of it filed a bug get

00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:34,349
it fixed you make the web let us hear

00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,690
what you need all of you here are great

00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:39,510
and work in production companies that I

00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,550
don't know I'm tired of hearing Silicon

00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,140
Valley kids in their startups complained

00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:44,970
that they can't use the coolest newest

00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,619
thing why does terrible websites out

00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:50,010
there where I sign up for an insurance

00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:51,960
or I try to get public transport I want

00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:53,130
every website to be beautiful and not

00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,900
just the ones that push the envelope

00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,030
because the envelope is flying away

00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,089
right now it's flying away into a closed

00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,530
environment or a rubbish bin please make

00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:02,849
something beautiful and keep the open

00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:06,500
web of life the way it is right now

00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:06,500
