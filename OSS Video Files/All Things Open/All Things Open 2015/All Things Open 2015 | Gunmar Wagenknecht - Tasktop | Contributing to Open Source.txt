	00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:09,570
and that's the reason why I'm also

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,809
standing here to tell you a little bit

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,179
today what do you how to how use out

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,609
yourself can connect and start

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:24,119
contributing to your face favorite open

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:25,800
source project now so i'll start with

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,710
give you a little bit of introduction of

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,890
how I define in my world how I define a

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,719
typically open source project and just

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,690
to give you a little bit of context what

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,460
I'm talking about and then I briefly

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,680
explain a few open source communities

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,739
there is a Clips there's Apache there

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:48,270
are many many others that that deal with

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,430
open source software and then the

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,670
important pieces making the connection

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,760
with the community and after you've done

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,219
that there are many many ways to

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,309
contribute and the most critical the

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,439
most important one is possibly or the

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:10,680
end the most highest one is contributing

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:12,720
code and then well I I did already in

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,280
the beginning but in the end we can talk

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,700
a little bit of motivation why you

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,400
should care why you should do this we

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,820
heard one one thing this morning in the

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,360
keynote you can actually have influence

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,720
on the stuff that you're using now let's

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,520
look at the typical open source project

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,710
anyone contributing to open source today

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:40,020
or are you all just interested in doing

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:42,170
it one good so obviously there is all

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,369
its software right so there must be code

00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:49,140
but code is just one thing the the other

00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:53,430
another important ingredient in an open

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,350
source project is or on the people right

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,540
so they're they're people that are

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,610
coding there are people that go to

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,729
conferences talk about the stuff about

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:07,980
the work they do and there are also

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:12,930
people just consuming using it and

00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:17,250
the third thing their rules has to be

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:21,510
but I get to that later let's just look

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:25,470
at the people so they are in a typical

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:28,380
source project there are few roles that

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,870
you define that I see or I've seen in

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:34,230
many many projects alright their owners

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,500
there are maintained errs commuters many

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,320
many different names let's start with

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:44,190
the owner the owner is interesting it's

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,990
it's it's not necessarily the one that

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,600
created the project but it's the one

00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,970
that actually owns the project it has it

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,070
in their account and to give an example

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:58,980
if you sign up and get up today upload

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:02,430
your code you're the owner of the of the

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,040
project but if you let create a project

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,710
and bring that to let's say apache or

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,660
the Eclipse Foundation you actually

00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,640
transfer the ownership of that project

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,570
to the Eclipse Foundation that's an

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:19,920
important piece because the because it

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:23,370
has implications of the on the project

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,030
and also on on the usage of its code

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,920
base for some foundations for example

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,050
Eclipse you even transfer things like

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:36,510
the Trade Mart to the Eclipse Foundation

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:38,760
so the story here behind this is if you

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,070
have a project just have it on open

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,250
source and you you are the owner you can

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,300
decide any time to shut down or move it

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,850
somewhere else because you're on the

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,550
train bar right when you bring it when

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,620
you bring it to a community then it's

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:58,620
there's a guarantee that it stays

00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:02,220
available for anyone the other end of

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,900
the most important group here the

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,150
maintenance the collaborators the ones

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,100
that that run the project they run the

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,160
business they keep the keep it alive

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,530
right so there are project leads there

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,330
are the commuters they they make code

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,719
changes they make that they plan the

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:22,569
development they line on the road map

00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:24,669
for a lot of project these days these

00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:27,879
are actually full-time people working in

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:31,840
a company that are dedicating parts of

00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:33,490
their time to making open source but

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,639
it's a constant like in these companies

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,039
it's a constant battle between your

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,979
regular commitments right and then also

00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,069
doing some open source but which let's

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:47,020
face it not every company actually has a

00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:48,729
business priority to contribute to open

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:54,400
source but a lot more companies should

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:57,539
have the contributors that's the group

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,069
I'd like you to get into they are

00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:02,379
contributing something it doesn't have

00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:04,300
to be code it's not always code but they

00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:06,759
contribute something to a project that

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,460
can be as easy as writing in tutorial or

00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,409
blogging about it right or updating a

00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:15,039
wiki page or adding some piece of

00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:16,539
documentation of course submitting code

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,129
is another way of contributing to a

00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:23,889
project the third group which is a very

00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:28,210
large group actually is the community

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:31,569
members they care about the project they

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,909
care because they either use it they

00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:35,650
care because they use it themselves for

00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:37,210
their work what they take care because

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,710
they use it and embedded into their

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:45,430
products which I call the adopters they

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:48,550
do things like filing bug reports giving

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:52,419
you hints how to make things better or

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:55,330
improve into into your in your project

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:58,089
they participate in discussions right

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,339
and and they they are active on the

00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:02,919
forums there they read and answer

00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:05,139
questions on stack overflow or on other

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:09,610
areas whatever you on the mailing list

00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:12,279
when you provide to your users and they

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,930
spread the word that's very important

00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:15,310
and that's very big help actually in

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,849
running an open source project if you

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:20,080
have people talking about your project

00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:23,529
that's about the best reference you can

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,479
get as an open source project by the way

00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:27,069
if you have any questions don't hold

00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:30,839
your breath don't wait till the end just

00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:30,839
raise your hand we can whatever you like

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,990
let's look at a few open source

00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:40,719
communities they are many many out there

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:46,839
but before I get into few examples I

00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:49,149
think at least I'd like to to discuss a

00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,099
little bit the the values of a community

00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:53,619
like why do we need to have a community

00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:57,520
I can just run the project by myself yes

00:06:53,619 --> 00:07:00,669
you can run a project by yourself but

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,619
the communities are there to help you so

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:04,479
for example if you take your project or

00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:07,240
if you have a project go to one of the

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,629
large communities you immediately have a

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,580
big outreach because you're uriel

00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:17,349
participate in the brand and awareness

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:20,219
of that community some communities for

00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:22,990
example Apache in Eclipse they define

00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:25,259
they have a strong governance model they

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:29,949
actually define a development process

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,749
that ensures that the contribution and

00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,409
the development of the projects follow

00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:37,569
some certain guidelines other

00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:41,680
communities for example such as GUID

00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:45,370
github they mainly only provide the

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,490
infrastructure on top of that github

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,680
actually contributes a bit of culture or

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,449
what they call the social coding part

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,979
the pull request model because that that

00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:58,839
actually changed a lot but there is no

00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:00,669
like at github you can do anything you

00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,469
want with a with a project or the

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,830
project owners they can do anything you

00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:09,449
want they they have a lot of freedom so

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:13,479
yeah already I already mentioned that

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:16,119
the Eclipse and apache here they have

00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:19,330
very strong they actually have very

00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:21,419
strong governance it eclipses it's

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,490
called the Eclipse development process

00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:27,729
and what does it do it actually defines

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,399
the roles in a project so we mentioned

00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:32,469
the word committers and and it also in

00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,810
this particular case it eclipses there

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,529
also project leads the one that are

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,529
responsible for

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,660
for entering or making information about

00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:46,810
the project public and then there's a

00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:49,370
project management committee that day

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,839
that is responsible as part of the

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,290
Eclipse development process it's

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:57,829
responsible for approving committer

00:08:53,290 --> 00:09:01,910
nominations committee loadings and also

00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:04,279
handling dealing with IP legal issues I

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,519
get to that later that's the root part

00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:10,100
which is sometimes a bit annoying but

00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:12,649
it's really important from a consumer

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,560
from a doctor perspective more as a user

00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:17,810
you probably don't care much but when

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,310
you're working for within a logic

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,389
company that this is a really critical

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:28,519
piece another very interesting example

00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:30,380
is the Linux community that is actually

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,459
not just a single community so there is

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:37,490
the linux foundation itself which is run

00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:40,550
as a foundation and those things but the

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,579
limit Linux community is much broader in

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,440
a way that you find many many sub

00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:47,600
communities within the Linux communities

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,639
because basically each distributor or

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,100
each distribution has its own community

00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,139
and then within the distributions there

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,740
are the projects or the software that

00:09:54,139 --> 00:10:00,319
also have run independently but also

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:05,449
part of the larger community so it's

00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:08,350
it's it's pretty big but it's also

00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:11,180
pretty easy to get or to connect to

00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,829
write because you just touch one area

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:16,579
and then you suddenly get right down

00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:18,290
into the project if you want to github I

00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:21,260
mentioned they mainly provide the

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,829
infrastructure which by the way all the

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,810
others do too except for for for Linux

00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:29,750
there is a little bit different in that

00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,250
a lot of the infrastructure is shared so

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,370
some distributors provide infrastructure

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,870
and some news infrastructure provided by

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:39,610
the linux foundation for example for

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,610
developing the Linux kernel itself

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,180
openjdk is a community created by oracle

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:48,710
around the developing new java develop

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,510
GRE

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,660
that's an interesting community as well

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:56,390
it's mainly the reason here it's mainly

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:59,210
driven by companies there are a few

00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,790
individuals but the goal of this

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:04,880
community of OpenJDK is actually to have

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,250
a group of companies collaborating

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:12,980
together which otherwise would never

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:16,510
work together on the single item yeah so

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,950
for one important thing about github is

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,470
there are many many projects and get up

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:25,670
but if you want if you think about Coney

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:27,920
booting keep looking if they actually

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,390
pick the license because if they never

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,580
pick the license and if there's no

00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,470
license information in there it's not an

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,900
open source project you can you look at

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,960
the code but legally you actually have

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,460
no permissions to use the code you need

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,140
to have a license in place in open

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,270
source license or even just a short

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,610
statement that says the code is public

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:55,850
domain then then you're good to work

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:58,790
with it so you want to you want to

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:02,060
actually start developing open source or

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:06,290
or actually help contribute to a project

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:10,130
and the way that is a sheet is by really

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,970
connecting with a community it will

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:16,730
never it will never work if you just

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:18,980
throw right a big chunk of code throw it

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,170
over the fence and say that's it go do

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,780
it right it's actually hard work

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,150
lobbying or discussing with the

00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,070
developers to make them aware that you

00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,410
want to contribute something that you're

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,300
working on that piece of technology and

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,500
that you want to bring it into the

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:39,740
project so in order to get to to that

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,700
you need to start connecting with the

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:46,420
community and one of the one of them

00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:49,970
that's actually the way I started is

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,010
helping just helping other users so back

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,350
in the early days in 2001 when i first

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:58,670
downloaded eclipse after IBM mated open

00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:00,380
source there was a forum there was a

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,170
mistake overflow there were some news

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,940
groups

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,010
and meaningless mailing lists were

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,779
mainly loose by the developers to

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,540
discuss the implementation the

00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:12,630
development of the project itself but in

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:17,579
the newsgroups there were there was the

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:20,130
only place to actually discuss and and

00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:23,100
meet people and answer but just by

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,279
answering their questions and with that

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:29,160
you start building a reputation right

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:30,930
your your name show up a couple of times

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:37,050
and the developers they will actually

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:41,760
realize that next thing next step my

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:45,120
tokus reporting problems usually an open

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,560
source project has a public bug tracking

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,470
system for Apaches it's JIRA its issue

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:55,709
Apache or issues Dada patriarchy for

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:58,889
Eclipse it's boxed eclipse.org for

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:01,170
example at github there's usually a tab

00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:03,750
for the issues within a project some

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:06,720
project use it some projects have an

00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:10,230
external system so it's really it's

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,290
really challenging or troubling

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,839
sometimes already to find out where you

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,310
start connecting with the community

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,380
luckily these days a lot of things are

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,240
easier because really if you want to

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,360
help users you just go to stack overflow

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,100
there's a pretty high chance that a lot

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,870
of users and developers will ask

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,490
questions about the particular project

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,620
they are so that's a good place to

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,269
actually start helping people and it's

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,560
also good place to make your reputation

00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:42,140
visible once you get into reporting

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,140
problems it's not just by simply

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,440
complaining that something is not

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,870
working it's actually really identifying

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,050
or showing developers how to reproduce a

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:54,660
problem and then also discussing already

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,940
discussing with them the actual

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,639
implementation or the arch or potential

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,089
fix right and and if you do that not

00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,130
just one time but many many more

00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:09,540
backward poets over the months or weeks

00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:11,910
or months or years then again they start

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:18,450
recognizing the name

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:20,910
because they interact with you third

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,920
thing you can do is go to conferences

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,200
you don't necessarily have to speak but

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,430
talking at conferences also good way to

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,040
actually connect with the community

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:31,440
because as you see in the next picture

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,690
there are many many people there are

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,520
actually the community members of the

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,620
project and then you can have lively

00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,670
discussions with each of them not just

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,740
with users but also with the developers

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:48,410
it's another way just socializing with

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:50,910
them talking and brainstorming ideas

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:55,110
right or just talk about other great

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:57,090
things and the more you do that the more

00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,290
you socialize you the more you network

00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,050
the more you communicate with the

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:07,850
developers the easiest it actually is

00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:10,160
for you to get code accepted because

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:13,740
really what you're doing is you're

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:17,790
building a level of trust with the

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:21,660
community with the team and when you're

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:25,440
ready to start contributing code then

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:29,760
the hard part begins I say hard because

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,070
it's it's not it's not it's information

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,810
that is not obvious I had to learn it

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,660
like a long way till I actually

00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,730
understood all the pieces and bits till

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,490
I finally managed to have my first

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:47,100
conclusion showing up at eclipse or

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:49,560
might code conversion a lot of project

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,550
have coding conventions sometimes they

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:56,580
are not really well documented or easily

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:59,280
access but hidden way deep into some

00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,840
different location or some very deep

00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,420
location photo structure inside the

00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,600
source code system there are stuff like

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:12,840
for example formatting settings that you

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:14,520
can import into your IDE it's really it

00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,680
can be really frustrating at first

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,660
because when I started submitting for

00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,150
example for the jagged project with it

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,809
which is a java-based get implementation

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,749
I

00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:29,289
nearly all of my reviews like the first

00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:31,179
one got immediately rejected because I I

00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:35,710
had things like a trailing whitespace in

00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:38,379
the line right so if you like committers

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,480
are humans and and sometimes they are

00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:42,999
very particular or some commuters are

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,679
more particular than others but again

00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:50,129
that's something that from working with

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,749
other people and company it's similar

00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:53,769
there's always something there are

00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:56,590
always some people which are more

00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:59,440
particular than others so really the I

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:02,590
am so really I think the really message

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,039
is don't try to change the existing

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:08,850
project coding conventions and

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:12,279
formatting with your first contributions

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:17,860
actually it is possible and we had we

00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:21,429
had this in the jagged project that

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:23,619
later on a contributor not even

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:26,259
committed started discussion I started

00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:29,409
the discussion discussion about changing

00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:31,840
some coding conventions and it turned

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:34,179
out that the majority of committer

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,340
actually liked it right so even as a

00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:39,190
contributor you can you can change we

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,929
have an influence on the project now

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,889
this isn't a functional influence but

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:48,639
it's still it simplifies it simplifies

00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:50,409
now life others too if you get closer to

00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:52,529
the more common coding conventions

00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:55,240
because they had really some special one

00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:58,539
yeah license are already mentioned it's

00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,009
very important to pick a license and you

00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:02,649
need to rule you need to review the

00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:04,119
license what it mandates from you from

00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:06,730
the contribution because I'm going with

00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:09,929
us sometimes it doesn't sometimes it

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:13,899
does intellectual property copyright

00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:17,919
that is also very important mostly if

00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:21,700
you are working for the company I get to

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,769
that data third-party libraries for a

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:29,499
lot of projects they actually don't care

00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:31,360
but the Eclipse Foundation for example

00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:34,150
they have a whole team

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,600
that is reviewing the users of their

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:40,270
party libraries and they do that for

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,780
reason that the community members of the

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:47,290
projects can assume that there is a low

00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:53,620
risk of consuming the projects of using

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:55,540
the project so you really have to you

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,770
have to think about this and actually

00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:01,870
accept or make compromises before you

00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:04,919
start contributing otherwise your

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:08,890
contribution will fail guaranteed so

00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,720
yeah so you need to look until when I

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,040
say following the project guides in

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,929
convention you need to look if there's a

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,330
process already defined for contribution

00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:18,010
for github is really easy because really

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:22,200
a lot of projects they are there because

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:25,900
they want the pull request Apache here

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,299
took years but they also now have git

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,340
repositories available which are

00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:33,309
available in github so you could also do

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:37,720
a pull request Eclipse has a garret

00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:40,390
instance they do Garrett reviews but

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,490
Garrett reviews is actually get reveries

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,260
comes out of the Android ecosystem or

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:47,890
the android open source community it's

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:50,559
it's a tool that they use for revering

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,240
code and Android Android by the way is

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,630
another very interesting community it's

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,780
it's an open source project you can do

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,660
small code contributions but mainly a

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,850
lot of development within the companies

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:07,200
or within Google actually happens

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:10,210
internally not visible in situ to to us

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:16,270
right to the public they just release it

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:19,990
from time to time so the garib review

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:23,169
model is is as a steep learning curve to

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:26,520
get into so the Eclipse Foundation also

00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:29,320
realized that it just because the github

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:33,460
pull request model is so popular that

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,860
they also allow github contributions but

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,230
again this is where it gets complicated

00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,600
the project is allowed to pick or

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,030
actually the maintainer of the project

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,100
are allowed to decide right so for some

00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:48,669
projects they use gate and Garrett

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:51,669
others use get and pull requests even

00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:53,820
though there are an eclipse project but

00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:57,299
the majority is get based these days

00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:00,309
patch size is another interesting thing

00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:03,419
usually what I've learned is that

00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:07,870
project tend to have smaller sizes and

00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:10,360
that they are really just address one

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,760
concern so even though you're fixing a

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,860
bug you see a different problem don't

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,500
try to change it in the same commit or

00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,720
in the same patch that really confuses

00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,299
like that will just cause confusion and

00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,870
more discussion with developers so try

00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:28,360
to focus on the actual change and if you

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:30,760
see another problem force yourself to

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,820
make a separate change I actually had to

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,799
you like that was not my my style of

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,450
working usually when I change code and

00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:39,820
see another problem I just fix it right

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:43,690
away and committed it's not always the

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:47,380
best way so it actually also helped

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:49,600
myself to you to work in a better

00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,480
process and have separate changes that

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:57,460
can then be merged in cherry pick

00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:00,400
individually another important thing or

00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:03,789
unit tests right some some projects

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,490
require to have run in union test so

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:10,690
even though to give an example the other

00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:13,809
the other day I was preparing a fix with

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:21,070
some Java class loading issues very

00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:22,780
annoying for library the bytecode at

00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:27,419
some sample code library which wasn't

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:31,120
source force previously but then when to

00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:33,340
get up and was pretty inactive during

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,710
the time inactive in a way that it was

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,350
still being used by a lot of parks folks

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,000
out there but not really maintained

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:43,980
anymore because it was stable nothing

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,870
had to change the problem is over time

00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:49,210
because it's a long library they had

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,640
initially a build system and end and

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:54,460
then a new build system and Gretel and

00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,460
really all I wanted to do is just simple

00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:00,860
class loader fix two lines of changes

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:03,110
but i ended up reimplemented part of the

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,000
ant build in degradable because the

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,850
committal wanted to have all the tests

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,690
run in the new greater world which it

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:14,180
like if you you have to sometimes I mean

00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:17,170
that it's a bad decision in my opinion

00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,700
what the the maintainer is did break fan

00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:22,400
but sometimes you have to accept that

00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,230
projects that work just work that way so

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,020
your only option then is if you don't

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:29,630
want to go the long way and reimplement

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:32,750
parts of their build or or refactor

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,160
parts of the other software the only

00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,840
option you have in the end is forking

00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,790
the project and doing your change

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,470
yourself that's what we did internally

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,150
because we had some time constraints but

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,050
I continued working upstream with a

00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:46,910
project to have the proper fix in place

00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:48,340
but that gets us back to the last point

00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:54,260
which is the most important one

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:56,210
communication and expectations it's it's

00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,220
really good if the developers know ahead

00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,930
of time that you are working on to

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,180
something that you're working on

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,580
something that you plan on contributing

00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,440
something and then you start discussing

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,870
with them how to actually implement it

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,020
because if they are if they are aware of

00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:14,450
it they can plan time they can't factor

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,740
in time into their own planning to

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,960
review the changes that you are

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:25,640
proposing and that that is actually

00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:28,640
that's actually a hard part is to get

00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,530
attention from the developers but if you

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,730
did the first steps in the beginning

00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:36,350
active in the community help users

00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,030
participating Connor in discussions or

00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,980
even connected personally and socialize

00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:44,660
with the developers and they know your

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:47,960
name it's it's much easier than if you

00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:51,310
just show up out of the dark submit a

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:54,770
thousand lines of changes and be silent

00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:56,300
that's actually guarantee that slow

00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,030
Strange's will never make it into a

00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:02,420
project because because a lot of

00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:03,920
projects they are concerned that not so

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,100
much for bug fixes but for new

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,560
functionality that gets added that they

00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,830
they want to see that the contributor

00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,529
has

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:17,169
and as an interest and in maintaining

00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:22,039
that functionality and if you do that

00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:24,200
that's actually going the next mile to

00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,850
become then a committer of the project

00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:31,460
it's all then you're no longer just a

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:34,760
contributor one slide about intellectual

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,529
property the boring ruled stuff but

00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,149
that's very important but you have to

00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,620
ask a couple of questions when you start

00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:42,139
contributing like how's the project

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:47,169
license sometimes it's do a license

00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:50,029
sometimes not you need to make sure that

00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:52,700
you need to clarify who owns the code

00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:54,860
that you can t produce that you wrote

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,260
that that you contribute and some

00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,570
employment agreements the copyright

00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,279
immediately goes to your employer then

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,950
it's not your decision to contribute the

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:08,120
code right you have to get approval from

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:10,309
your employer to contribute it which

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,779
actually means to realize that we I

00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:17,419
since the code that you are submitting

00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:20,269
and that's why that's why a lot of those

00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:23,380
open source communities have these clas

00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:26,110
current contributor license agreements

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:30,010
it's really just a way to ensuring that

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:33,500
there is a good that there is proper

00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:38,840
provenance improvement of the code where

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:41,590
it's coming from and that you then

00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,840
certify that you have the right to

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:47,450
contribute it eclipse for example has

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,659
multiple levels of clas you can sign an

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:53,510
individual CLA that's really easy just a

00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:55,309
one click for anything that you

00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,779
personally wrote in your time that you

00:27:55,309 --> 00:28:00,830
own the copyright and then you can just

00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:04,100
contribute it but I clips also offers

00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:08,120
whole companies to have serious in place

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,679
they call it member agreements I know

00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,710
that some of the larger members they

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,809
have four agreements so you can easily

00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,669
as an employee of that company you can

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:21,049
easily contribute to any project that is

00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:23,419
it at eclipse for example in the early

00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:25,970
days I remember when I contributed to

00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:29,210
the GWT project the google web toolkit I

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:32,710
actually had to sign a CLA by hand and

00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:38,600
then fax it to some random fax number in

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:41,509
California and two days later I actually

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,940
asked on the bug report if it's now ok

00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:45,350
to accept it and they said yep paperwork

00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:49,149
received so apparently there's some

00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:51,200
process here that wasn't clear but

00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:54,350
really companies just want to make sure

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,330
that you're following the process and

00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:59,330
that's also why some are reviewing

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:02,690
third-party libraries very carefully for

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:04,820
example I don't know who of you develops

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:10,419
in Java there's a very popular library

00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,419
for daytime called Yoda daytime library

00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:16,009
unfortunately we can't use that library

00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:19,039
at eclipse because it turns out that in

00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:21,289
the early days the maintainer of the

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,440
library did a poor job in tracking where

00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:27,649
code contributions came from right so

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,330
they're basically just that's the worst

00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:31,309
thing you can do is sending code

00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:36,259
directly to an email to some committer

00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:38,809
or to someone because then you it isn't

00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:40,730
clear if that gets committed where it's

00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:42,799
coming from so that's why a lot of

00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,259
projects have these processes in place

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,379
you need to go to a bug tracking system

00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:50,690
to either upload a patch or you need to

00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:52,960
go to github or Garrett to submit a pull

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:56,210
request or review that they can then

00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:01,470
work on and verify that you can

00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:08,170
contribute it all right

00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:10,780
yeah and that's mostly it that the last

00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:13,290
light is mainly about the motivation why

00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:16,660
I think you should care contributing is

00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:18,820
and the important message is what I

00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:22,210
heard in the keynote this morning you

00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:25,540
get a chance to influence the project

00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,480
and I'd like to add another one you get

00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:32,620
a chance to meet really great people

00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:34,600
like in this 14 13 years since i've

00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,570
started doing this I met so many great

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:43,510
people at conferences or at hackathons

00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:45,280
or a demo camps which I never believed I

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:49,210
would I would actually doing this

00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:52,030
because like I'm the AI based in Germany

00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,460
is a small town with 20,000 people right

00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,600
I work for small companies or in the

00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,440
early days I got for smaller companies

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,860
where a small group everyone knows it I

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:06,150
actually like my parents list if I live

00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:08,980
still in the same town I was born in and

00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:11,320
today and this is also because of open

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:13,000
source I work for toss-up technologies

00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,240
which is headquartered in Vancouver I

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,300
hope removed most of the time but again

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,750
the CEO I met him 2006 in San Francisco

00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:28,300
at eclipse kinetic conference back then

00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:30,640
he was a graduate student writing on the

00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,470
Eclipse Milan open source project right

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,310
and we exchanged a little bit ideas and

00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:39,130
then like two years ago we decided and

00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:42,220
to work together on this stuff and this

00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:46,300
is really what open source can do which

00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:51,210
i think is impossible if you just live

00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:54,510
in a close shot well Marlo

00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:58,049
all right that's it if you have any

00:31:54,510 --> 00:32:00,440
questions otherwise thanks a lot for

00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,440
