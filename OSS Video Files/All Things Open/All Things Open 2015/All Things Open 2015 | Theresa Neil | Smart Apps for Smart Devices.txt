00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,849
of workshops and talks for the design

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,880
community so it's exciting for me to be

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,270
speaking with developers again raise

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,460
your hand if you are a developer in fact

00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,110
do we have any people who are either UX

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,059
designers in the room or people who are

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,739
fault like holding that role right now

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,550
even though it's not your official site

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,180
okay good well it's better than me

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,190
posing to be a developer right all right

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,140
well so I'm a UX designer I've been in

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,760
this field about 14 years I started off

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,969
as a Java programmer but it's been a

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,620
long time since I've coated anything I

00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,559
work with a lot of really big companies

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,840
and probably familiar names too but I

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,840
also work with a lot of startups and so

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,510
well doc is doing a lot of innovative

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,860
things in the healthcare space they had

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,900
that first fda-approved a prescription

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,549
app for diabetes so basically a doctor

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,080
would say here's your insulin

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,320
prescription here's your app

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,790
prescription worked with silver card to

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,580
launch their product which was a

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,490
reimagining car rental for business

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:34,200
travelers steady serve as a company here

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:37,380
in Raleigh and they do real-time beer

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,979
inventory management and then immune IO

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,259
is a security company in the in the

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,939
Northeast that's trying to rebel

00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:48,479
revolutionize how we how we handle a

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,159
network security so I've written a lot

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,130
about patterns I've been in a Riley

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,540
author for six years now my first book i

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,850
co-authored with bill Scott it was

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,590
designing web interfaces my last two

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,590
books have been about mobile interface

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,810
design I talk a lot about patterns I'm

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,820
invited by companies to come speak about

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,170
patterns which is pretty much the most

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,259
boring thing you can never sit through

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,420
because I'm like here's this pattern

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:13,830
here's this powder it lends itself much

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,860
better to a book than

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,050
does to a talk I talk about good

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,640
patterns I talk about anti-patterns

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,630
which in the world of design wins things

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,340
you should not be doing and and to this

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,890
day I still believe you I patterns are

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,560
valuable but I've also noticed that they

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,330
can be a trap and that's because when

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,340
you start thinking about a pattern a

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,100
design pattern to solve a problem a UI

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,350
design pattern all of a sudden you went

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,780
super super super micro before you

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,520
thought all the way up here and so

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,770
that's that's the biggest trap of

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,540
patterns and I want to take you through

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,620
a short case study and then we'll look

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,930
and see how to break out of that

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,910
potential problem so as a designer with

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,340
a design firm have about 15 people that

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,370
work with me full time we receive a lot

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:06,750
of RFPs does anybody is anybody in here

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,540
a freelancer or consultant yeah and is

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,459
everybody familiar with what our RFP is

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,440
companies like hey we want to launch a

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,170
product by the end of the year yeah we

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,910
know it's October 20th we have about 100

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,220
bucks and we're hoping that you could

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,470
design and develop this for as I get it

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,580
launched you know before the holiday

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,230
like before anybody leaves from

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,480
thanksgiving i'm like it's october

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,400
twenty okay so that's what an RFP is so

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,489
we got one of those in the mail from mac

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,290
cosmetics not mail email over the summer

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:35,780
and there's wasn't it wasn't quite as

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,720
bad and they started off with a good

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,930
project brief they're like look we want

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,190
to create new and strengthen existing

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,440
relationships and you guys might be

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,810
thinking why is she using this as a case

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,340
study now i am happy to see a lot of

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,380
women here today bet you know developer

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,030
conferences are you know a lot of times

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,030
predominantly male and this is a

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,890
cosmetics case study well I don't wear

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,510
cosmetics any more than the majority if

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,370
you probably do so this was a very

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,390
interesting project for me I had to go

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,269
and learn it was like mac cosmetics

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,980
what's that so fortunately out of the

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,600
folks on my team do wear cosmetics and

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,670
they're like go over to the domain try

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,709
it out go get a makeover blah blah so I

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,590
got to go learn a lot about makeup to

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,750
work on this project so like I said they

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,910
sent out an RFP to design agencies and

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,539
they wanted to create a rewards program

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:27,570
is similar in nature to nordstroms so

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:29,160
Nordstrom's has had a huge amount of X

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,420
success with this loyalty program they

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,040
came up with they've got more than 6

00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,960
million members they've got at least

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,720
points in these systems and you earn

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,850
rewards and this was their one of their

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,980
sources of inspiration and my first

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,440
thought was we've got this we can

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,150
totally win this because we did a lot of

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,650
work on the Nordstrom's reward program

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:51,300
so it should be a shoo-in and there are

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,390
tons of great patterns out there that we

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,700
can leverage for a loyalty program so if

00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,340
anybody in here drink Starbucks you've

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,230
got the starbucks rewards program you've

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,790
got this program set up from American

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,130
Express where they're working with uber

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,810
so basically if you pay for your uber

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,550
ride with American Express you get extra

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,690
points you think about it we use a lot

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,460
it probably use a lot of rewards

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,830
programs especially when we travel

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,240
there's lots of really good patterns out

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,290
there not just for mobile but for

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,190
desktop as well and then my next thought

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:27,420
was really like let me let's make sure

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:29,460
is this really the right thing to design

00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,520
for them it's putting this point system

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,290
in place where let's say you buy 10 cups

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,080
of coffee you get one free you buy 10

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,660
lipstick you get one free you pay with

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,080
this you get extra this is this really

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,620
what mac cosmetics is super trendy

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,420
high-end company trying to do and in

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,830
fact in their rfp they spoke a little

00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,110
bit about that they're like well this

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,250
isn't like buy 10 get one free it's

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,830
trying to figure out like how do we

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,370
create loyalty among our customers and

00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,360
keep them coming back but they were

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,220
still convinced they should make a

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,650
rewards program and it should be on

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,590
their app and then everybody should be

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,600
able to use it in their app I thought

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,820
well okay let's let's think a little bit

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,250
about this so they have a thousand

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:17,040
stores worldwide they are the number two

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:20,790
high-end cosmetic in the US and they're

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:24,180
used by models modeling agencies stars I

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,850
guess everybody uses them they are the

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,950
number one high on cosmetic in emerging

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,290
markets like Brazil and India because

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,360
they target women 18 through 49 of all

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,890
colors so they have great products for

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,030
all of us no matter what the complexion

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,430
what the age

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:42,420
so if we start thinking about this and

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:44,940
we look at smartphone penetration now

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,620
this is an old chart but all the rest of

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,840
them were so ugly I couldn't bear to put

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,150
them in my presentation I feel that it's

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,620
probably fairly accurate let's look at

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:57,930
the group that we just talked about so

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,850
this is yeah 18 to 49 let's focus in on

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,510
this look at this smartphone penetration

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:07,680
by agent income for 18 to I brought it

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:11,280
up to 44 year old it's pretty high even

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,260
in emerging markets still really high so

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,970
if we think about that we don't need to

00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,580
necessarily come up with a rewards

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,530
program that came about back in the days

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,020
when we were using punch cards at the

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,420
coffee shop or the gas station saying oh

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,610
yeah I had I had 10 ice cream cones can

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,700
I have a free one and I think we should

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,170
I think we should break out one of the

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,300
reasons I think that we should break out

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,000
of that type of thinking is because

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,550
mobile has really changed retail so I

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,620
spent the past three years working with

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,780
a coupon and company called retailmenot

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:47,340
and we've had a lot of success in

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,930
rethinking I guess savings in retail

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,400
environments and in doing that we've

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,200
done a lot of research where we have

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,260
went actually out in the field with

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,850
people at their homes and in malls and

00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,190
other shopping stores to see how people

00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,180
shop how they think about shopping turns

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,770
out there's a lot of pre-planning

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,020
involved especially in people who are

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,220
looking to find particular deals I was

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,870
thinking about that research and

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,290
thinking about how shopping has has

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,820
changed with the advent of mobile so we

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,890
know now that over eighty percent of

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,410
shoppers in the US do a considerable

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,780
amount of research before going into the

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,000
store to buy something this is even down

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,740
to cosmetics it's not just if you're

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,600
going to buy a car or an expensive TV

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,090
tablets are the preferred research

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,830
device this is what people are using at

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,630
home to do their research before going

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,550
on at the store and then we know that

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,920
shoppers are practicing multi screening

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,780
meaning that although the tablets prefer

00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,630
they may reference it again on their

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,760
phone or on their smart TV even on their

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,540
watch

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,670
and then maybe back to their desktop

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,140
then we know that in stores mobile

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,240
point-of-sale is becoming commonplace

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,730
there's a lot more going on in retail

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,590
including beacons for delivering

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,730
targeted rewards or incentives in

00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,640
Nordstrom's if you go into nordstroms

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,810
rack which I do I like Nordstrom stuff

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,030
but I like to save a little bit of money

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,740
when I go in there and I look around and

00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,750
I've got my arm full of clothes and some

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,580
shoes there's a guy that inevitably

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,290
Wanderers why wanders by with his

00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,400
smartphone he's able to ring me up right

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,890
there so I don't have to wait in line

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,390
certainly around the the holiday season

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,580
you'll see a lot more of that in stores

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,950
and then of course we know that and

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,100
there's this incident of showrooming

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,510
where people are going into stores

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,240
finding what they like and then going

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:36,050
back home and buying it online for a for

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,000
a cheaper price so retail is definitely

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,730
changed in the past couple of years with

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,470
the advent of mobile so why would we

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,180
stick with this old idea and just say

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:50,750
hey let's go find some patterns for it

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:52,850
we can do a lot more exploration so what

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,570
we did is we created three different

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:58,610
storyboards for them that pulled in

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,020
different ideas that we came to through

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,590
going through a brainstorming exercise

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,660
one of them was this ibeacon experience

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,120
so we partnered with a company in Austin

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:11,030
called best fit mobile and they have a

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,920
product called ibeacon it's rolled out

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,140
in a lot of stores throughout the u.s.

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,840
one of the the best examples would be

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,480
probably gamestop so I have a 16 year

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,550
old plays a lot of video games he has

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,370
gamestop installed on his phone when he

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:28,160
goes into gamestop the associates there

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,020
have a tablet so each associate has

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,150
their own personal tablet it

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,640
triangulates using the beacon and says

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:38,390
oh aaron just walked in the store they

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,490
now see the floor plan this is for Mac

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,260
but imagine this is for gamestop they

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,090
see the floor plan on their store and

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,920
for each person that's in the store that

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,140
has gamestop installed on their iPhone

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,940
or Android so they see that person's

00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,040
profile they know everything about that

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,930
person related to gamestop including

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,280
their past purchases maybe what level

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,360
they're at in the game and you're

00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,500
thinking this is pretty

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,120
creepy which it is because a lot of

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,649
times that's my money that's going to

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,380
gamestop to buy another game that

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,399
they've up sold my teenager but if you

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,019
think you know from the retailer's

00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,160
perspective this is it this is an

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:13,310
opportunity to create a very

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,720
personalized shopping experience which

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,180
could be a very positive thing

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,880
especially in the case of cosmetics so

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,560
what we laid out here in this storyboard

00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,170
is a very similar thing using that

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,820
ibeacon technology so that were I to

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,920
walk into the mac store they'd be like

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,990
hey Theresa how are you doing how did

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,910
those whatever we gave to you last time

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,380
workout are you getting a little low on

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,570
the lipstick we have a new thing that

00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:39,200
you might like and I would have a better

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:42,860
experience in the store there's also

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,180
opportunities for once the M the

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,649
customer is in the mac store that they

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,480
get their own information on their phone

00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,510
so perhaps they don't want to be

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,860
approached or there isn't time for a

00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,660
associate to approach them they can

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,130
immediately schedule a makeover they

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,380
know where to walk to you to go over to

00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,440
the next artist who's free all these

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,610
different things can create a better in

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,610
store shopping experience

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,270
part of the in-store shopping experience

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,380
we came up with was a digital makeup map

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,880
so this is something that was new to me

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,160
I didn't know what these things were

00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,560
apparently if you go in to get a

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,670
makeover which you guys probably won't

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,200
be doing any time soon how many women in

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,210
the room have had a makeover where you

00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,120
get this little paper map that they hand

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,890
back to you okay so it's a printed out

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,990
piece of paper that has a face on it and

00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,580
then the artist when they're putting the

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,320
makeup on you and you've decided that

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,020
you like something they actually color

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,820
in the the piece of paper with what

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,290
you've decided to buy so this is the

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,240
eyeshadow color you said you liked this

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,800
is the lipstick this is where it goes so

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,880
what we did is we switched it over to a

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,340
digital makeup map and we have the

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,050
artists using google glass originally I

00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,050
wanted them to be able to use the tablet

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,340
that we had back here that they were

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,540
they were able to see the customers in

00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,340
the store width but we couldn't figure

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,560
out how to position the tablet so that

00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,850
they could get it's like okay so here's

00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,020
the makeup artist here and here's the

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,960
person's face where would you put the

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,750
tablet to do a recording and so what we

00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,600
ended up doing was going with google

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:22,200
glasses so what happens is the artists

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,880
as eyes start and I start starts the

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,070
video recording of the makeup artist

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,920
applying the eyeshadow onto the person's

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:32,370
eyes or all the eye makeup what's good

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,080
about this is this customer doesn't want

00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,630
some huge video of all these different

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,310
things that she tried on if she ends up

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,870
buying this eyeshadow when she gets home

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,510
she wants to know how do I apply this

00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,040
eyeshadow on my eye if your eyes closed

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,690
while they're doing it which it has to

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,280
be you're not really able to observe

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:52,800
this so what it does is it creates

00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:56,310
little targeted videos for each part of

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,010
the face and then again using that

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,710
beacon technology it shares that video

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,900
with the customers personal iphone in

00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,850
their app so when they get home they're

00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,650
able to say oh I bought this eyeshadow

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,270
how do I put it on they pull up the

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,280
little one minute video or however long

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:14,339
the application was and they can see

00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,860
right there how to apply it this doesn't

00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,480
just increase customer loyalty what this

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,740
says is make sure that when somebody

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,200
leaves with four hundred dollars worth

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,710
of makeup they use it everyday and what

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,810
happens if they use it everyday

00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,180
they run out what can we do in these

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,070
apps to make sure that they get more we

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,420
put online ordering in the app and we

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,980
make sure that we're talking to them and

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,020
promoting these different things so

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,700
there's no better way to get Mac to earn

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,440
more money than to make sure people are

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,270
using their product on a daily basis and

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,860
when we did our research we found out

00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,040
the reason people weren't using the

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,870
makeup on a daily basis excuse me is

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,550
because they were uncomfortable scared

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,750
or they weren't sure of the results they

00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,760
were going to get they knew it looked

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,930
good when the artist put it on them but

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,940
they weren't sure they could achieve the

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:58,360
same result I know that was one of my

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,640
fears so we actually came up with a

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,920
couple of different ideas as well into

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,620
this whole brainstorming exercise so one

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,020
of them was and doing something really

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,570
simple like Instagram filters so within

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,960
the mac app if you took photos of

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:18,040
yourself again think of think of women

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:20,740
18 to 49 you can apply a filter of one

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,570
of Mac's new looks so Mac has a lookbook

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,210
so they go kind of crazy right they've

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:27,280
got their targeting Superstars and

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,200
models and what you could do is upon

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,270
taking a picture a selfie or picture of

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,250
your friends you could apply a filter to

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,570
apply one of their new looks then you

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,100
post up to Facebook people are like oh

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,510
my gosh that's amazing and then they

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,550
would tell you ok these are the products

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,560
you need to buy to achieve that look we

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:45,190
also came up with another idea where you

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:49,320
could we put these on in visual story

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:51,700
boards to pitch to Mac an idea where

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,080
you're out shopping you find a couple of

00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,640
different outfits you like you can just

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,160
take a photo of those and it would

00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,870
recommend looks based on the outfit that

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,580
you pegged out so predominantly it was

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,680
based on like the color scheme so if you

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,940
picked a purple dress here would be the

00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,220
colors that would go well with your

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,550
purple dress so we showed them these

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:12,820
different opportunities and they're like

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:15,280
wow this is this is so much more than a

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,780
loyalty program right this is really

00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,580
thinking about how do we drive people

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,350
into our stores how do we drive more

00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,330
ordering online how do we make sure

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,590
people are using our products how do we

00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:27,910
make sure they're comfortable with our

00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:30,690
products and overall it was it was

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:32,550
wildly successful

00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,590
and so that's where i talk about

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,840
patterns being a trap they're good

00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,360
they're just not good at the concept in

00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,160
phase right once you've decided what are

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,620
we going to do in the app then you can

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,700
use some UI design patterns to figure

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,190
out what your screens are going to look

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,970
like so what I'd like to talk with you

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,320
guys about today is going through this

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,750
brainstorming checklist for how to

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,130
create a great mobile UX and some of

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,050
these you'll think oh this isn't really

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:01,620
relevant to what I'm doing at work today

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:03,090
and and they may not be other ones do

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,709
you think this isn't really relevant to

00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:06,420
what I'm doing at work today but tonight

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,829
while you're making dinner or tomorrow

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,900
when you're eating breakfast you're

00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,520
going to think wait a second if we

00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,600
integrate it something like that that

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,520
would completely change the way our

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,900
product works and you're going to go in

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,500
and be able to explore that with some

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:22,410
the folks that you work with so this is

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,970
typically a workshop and but today I

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,920
have an hour to speak with you normally

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,930
I have half a day or a whole day we

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,730
actually get out index cards we

00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,290
prototype this we throw it into a little

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,540
digital prototype and we test it on

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,400
people today we're going to walk through

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,920
the brainstorming part and I'm hoping

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,870
that you'll find value in this and when

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,330
I take it back to your organization and

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,280
have your stakeholders your product

00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,220
people if you have designers your

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,540
designers and fellow developers have

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,580
them work together and do a similar

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,520
brainstorming exercise when you start

00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,380
new mobile design or if you're going to

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,560
do say a new release or looking at your

00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,700
roadmap down the road excuse me your

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,700
your future roadmap

00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:14,430
I am going to ask so that people don't

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,140
get sleepy right before lunch that as we

00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,940
go through this you might want to take

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,830
some notes or at least be thinking in

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,830
your head and coming up with ideas for

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:25,170
this activity at the end I'm going to

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,270
ask two people to share and you can just

00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,850
share one of any of the ideas you come

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,160
up with and for the first two people who

00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,440
share you get a copy of my pattern book

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,450
I gave away my third copy this morning

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,190
to this lovely lady up here who provided

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:43,980
me an adapter so I would be able to show

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:45,570
you my slideshow today alright so we're

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,610
going to get away from cosmetics because

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,590
not everybody knows a lot about cosmetic

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:53,010
stores but I think all of us have been

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:56,220
to a museum right this would be the

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:59,640
Museum of Natural History so let's say

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,280
we get an RFP from them and they say we

00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:06,000
really want a nap that's all our RFP

00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,890
start with we really want an app for iOS

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,020
and Android and what we want to do with

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:13,200
this app is replace paper-based

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,120
membership cards so people will no

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,130
longer have to carry a museum membership

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,000
card they can just show their app to get

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:24,240
into the museum and we said wow that's

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,610
riveting what an exciting projects or

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,620
work on yeah that's not what we said

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,390
that's what we thought we're like but

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,420
think of all the things you could do

00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:36,360
with an app for a museum like our people

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,580
who are members really struggling with a

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,650
paper-based membership card like this is

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,300
this is the biggest pain point all of

00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:47,880
your museum goers have is this one thing

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,950
so what will you do in this case and I

00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,020
would ask you to suspend disbelief at

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,130
the Museum they probably do not have an

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,840
unlimited budget but for our

00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,690
brainstorming activities let's pretend

00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,760
they do what we do here is first thing

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,700
is we drill in and say let's talk about

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,500
the people who come to your museum and

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,820
the people who work in your Museum so we

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,710
can get an idea of who were actually

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,450
designing for because one of the worst

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,520
things you can do is come up with this

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,650
great technology and then try to find a

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,930
problem for it to solve let's start with

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,330
the people figure out what they're like

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,270
what their real pain points are and then

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,919
start solving for those

00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:24,720
so at a museum we have a couple

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,149
different pipe there this museum had a

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,789
couple different types of users or

00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:31,740
personas we've got the enthusiast he

00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:33,990
actually is a member his biggest pain

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,510
point is not the paper membership card

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,000
we've got a student who comes maybe once

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:41,070
or twice for some additional research

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,720
we've got families that come they may be

00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,130
members and they may be people who are

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,659
visiting and they want something to do

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:47,039
with their afternoon and then we also

00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,809
have the people who work within the

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:53,279
museum in this case we are talking about

00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:54,870
the head the museum head so not going to

00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,850
take you deep into the research the

00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:00,600
museum here but I'm going to show you a

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,770
couple of existing pain points and if

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,350
you don't want to call them pain points

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:06,149
you can say these are opportunities so

00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:08,070
what I used to do is I used to from my

00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:10,169
clients draw this map and put all these

00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,240
like red x's of all these places where

00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,710
things were failing and it made

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,570
everybody feel bad and so now I put

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,580
green stars all over it as these are

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,850
areas for possible opportunities be

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:24,000
amazed how it changes the conversation

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:26,220
so the visitors at this museum they're

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,730
usually students or adults with children

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:32,970
all right there are some of these adults

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,380
by themselves these enthusiasts but

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,570
we've got a lot of students a lot of

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,270
classes coming through a lot of parents

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:41,510
with kids coming through they rely on

00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:47,220
the paper brochures or the audio guide

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:49,500
so does anybody used and one of the more

00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:53,010
recent like iphone guides where you go

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,700
in use and so what did you have to

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,700
download the app

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,010
and did you pay for the app you didn't

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,860
he'll ok that's cool so a lot of these

00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:12,040
museums were years ago renting out the

00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,530
little cds or Walkmans with the guide on

00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,710
it to get additional revenue i think

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:23,620
some of them do you charge for a for a

00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:26,760
nap excuse me with the audio guide then

00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:30,040
the museum head she's rude she's Reba

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,290
relying on satisfaction surveys to say

00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,910
if visitors like the displays do they

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,500
like the experience basically there's an

00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,790
optional survey when you leave museum

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,620
you can say oh yeah I would come back

00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:42,940
again or nothing so this could be better

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,760
some other possible opportunities is

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,559
some visitors have a window of time

00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,820
others have unlimited time so you can

00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:50,679
imagine if you had in there with a

00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,600
couple of small kids like when I take my

00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,390
little kids somewhere I've got a very

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,429
limited time before the break down and I

00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,020
would really want to maximize our trip

00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,690
and get out of there before they get

00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,220
hungry or sleepy and have a fit I see

00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,590
some people nodding you must also have

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,240
toddlers you know what it's like you're

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,660
like okay got an hour and a half let's

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,940
go and this particular museum has an

00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,650
outdoor bone dig scavenger hunt but it's

00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,090
only opening clear weather and so

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,040
there's a lot of unhappy kids who get

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,190
there and find out that in fact it's not

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,169
open then we've got the museum

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,809
administrator so she basically has no

00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:27,640
insight into what's happening with the

00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:29,110
people who are coming into her museum

00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,760
she knows the number of people who come

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,590
in she knows how many are members and

00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,770
non-members she knows so many tickets

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:38,010
are sold which is no idea what people

00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:40,809
are looking at what they're enjoying and

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:43,120
if she had some misinformation it would

00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:44,950
help her in her grant applications and

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,520
possibly she might also be able to do

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:50,290
some better fundraising to she wants to

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:54,160
convert visitors to members and also

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:56,740
wants to bring in more members alright

00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:00,580
so we are going to start thinking about

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:04,120
if we were going to go to the museum and

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,130
say you want this card thing but let's

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,710
talk about some opportunities that you

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:10,360
have not just like not just the way

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,940
everybody else is on it for all these

00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,000
years but let's really look into and see

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,740
what are

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,590
the possibilities that smart devices

00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:21,320
could offer this would be the checksheet

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:24,050
that we would go through and so if you

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,760
guys have pen and paper or just in your

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,990
head as we go through each of these

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,880
possible elements this is a

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,620
brainstorming exercise jot down what you

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,710
think could be useful in a museum

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,960
application so one of the things that i

00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:40,880
have found to be useful in this is to

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:43,310
pick one of these either are enthusiasts

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,620
or student our family and think about

00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,830
what would their experience be like in

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,800
the museum if we were going to create

00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,970
let's just say it's some type of app to

00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,670
to make them have a better experience

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,260
and then we'll go through here and take

00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:01,370
a look at some of the opportunities so

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,730
for the past couple years when we have

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:06,620
designed native apps and we'll think

00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,150
about okay what's the difference between

00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,160
should we do this responsive or should

00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,110
we do it native some things may lead us

00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,180
to do a native app over a responsive app

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,530
and if we are going native we think okay

00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,660
let's make sure that we're exploiting

00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:19,850
the capabilities in need of a native app

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,390
and right off the bat you'll think okay

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:25,340
we have location awareness and we have

00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,300
the ability to get to the like let's say

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:31,100
the calendar and the contacts we can use

00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,660
the camera and at that point you're like

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,760
okay cool I've got a bunch of ideas

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,170
let's go but I want to make sure that

00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,300
we're actually thinking through all of

00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,900
the opportunities if you're doing a

00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:44,480
native app so there's a lot of ambient

00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,180
data that you can collect and when

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,070
you're starting or working on any design

00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,840
project it's good to walk through this

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,930
and make sure you haven't overlooked a

00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,320
couple of them so the first one would be

00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:58,610
location so if we are thinking about our

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,830
visitors to the museum and we're

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,230
creating a museum app for them how could

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:07,490
we use location to enhance the

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,750
experience so I'm not going to give you

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,510
an example for each of these I'm going

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:14,120
to want you to brainstorm but in in this

00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:17,560
case in the last workshop I did a lot of

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:21,320
people spoke about well if people are

00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:24,800
looking online at home before they leave

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,240
for the museum to see is the museum open

00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,210
how much does it cost where is it

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,020
located

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:33,690
if we're able to at the point of them

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,210
buying a ticket from home capture some

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,860
of their information and we may be able

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,140
to do something at that point where we

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,330
encourage them to download the app so

00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,250
let's say family forward they just

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,630
bought their tickets they say go ahead

00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,429
and download the app so you'll be ready

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:51,049
when you get to the museum to explore

00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:53,039
the museum and a deaf point we could say

00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:55,440
once they download the app we could say

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,870
hey you have tickets for the museum

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,659
today these are the peak times that

00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,850
people are usually there and here are

00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:04,649
some possible transportation options to

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,230
get there based on where you're at your

00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:08,940
location and the museum's location so

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,580
you could get there by car within 10

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:15,419
minutes or public transport 20 minutes

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,730
uber 15 minutes so forth so that's one

00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:23,460
opportunity for harnessing ambient data

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:25,409
for location as we get farther into this

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,779
will talk about beacons and what it

00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:30,059
might look like this family gets to the

00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,590
museum and the beacon is aware that

00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:33,779
they're there and is able to maybe greet

00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,990
them instead of even having them show

00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:40,950
their pass it will just know that they

00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:44,610
can go in so our app could also be able

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:47,360
to determine the time of day and or the

00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,360
light dark conditions

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,850
so again in thinking about this I know

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,809
in Google now on my android phone when I

00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:01,700
when I look up a place to go it'll tell

00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:03,800
me if it's closing within an hour or not

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,450
so it's like no this place is 57 minutes

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,309
from you and it's closing three minutes

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:10,490
after you get there like oh thank you i

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:13,280
will not be going today in this example

00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,570
here just the map one basically if it's

00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,920
if it's light outside we have a light

00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,809
background if it's dark outside we have

00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,400
a dark background it's not using the

00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:26,360
time of day it's actually using the

00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:29,150
detection of of the light so we can also

00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:32,090
harness sound in this example these

00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:34,790
folks are watching movies and what's

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:37,250
happening is it's using a actually this

00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,990
is probably not the best example I I

00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,820
couldn't find a picture of what i wanted

00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,500
to show but there is there are a couple

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,480
of apps out there that raise and lower

00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,190
the volume as you're watching a video

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,480
based on the background noise so you're

00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:52,940
not constantly having to do that

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:55,190
yourself are not something that's

00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,140
probably applica applicable for our

00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,300
museum app right if you think about it a

00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,170
herd of third graders show up behind you

00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,760
and you're trying to hear more about

00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,350
this exhibit you don't have to be

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,660
constantly raising the volume maybe it

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:10,220
can detect that for you we can also okay

00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,800
I'm cheating here we can detect

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,690
temperature we can detect whether based

00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,730
on location right in this one there's

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,309
actually this little dongle attached to

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,380
to the phone that's that's reading the

00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:23,420
actual temperature like where you are

00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,160
right now but we can we can determine

00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,530
the weather and so if we're thinking

00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,020
about the outdoor scavenger hunt the

00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,660
bone dig and inclement weather is coming

00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,130
at maybe we're telling parents hey need

00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:38,420
to get there before the storm in the

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:43,010
afternoon of course we can use the the

00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:46,670
camera so this is an example of using

00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:50,570
the camera for it's probably not

00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:54,140
alternate reality but um I it's

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:57,320
highlighting on this 3d model where

00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:59,440
there are issues directly me look at my

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,520
notes on this so I'm not misleading you

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,520
yep I have no notes on this one

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,190
and it's basically showing where are

00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:15,630
there issues in this particular model so

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,940
let's say that you're working in a

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:20,820
factory you can use the camera to scan

00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,440
what's being produced and identify where

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,600
there are errors and some of the items

00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,780
that were produced throw those ones away

00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,919
let the rest go down the assembly line

00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,990
we'll look at a little bit something in

00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,720
more depth about that in a minute in

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:37,440
this example here we're using the camera

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,030
to create a new scenario so in this one

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,289
it's like well what if I bought this

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:43,650
chair what would it look like in this

00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:47,280
environment thinking over to our Museum

00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:49,080
app this is something that may be a good

00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,150
idea because the museum's not going to

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,730
rip out the exhibits they have today

00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:56,520
right they are going to want to augment

00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:05,039
them and so is the camera a possibility

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:07,200
for augmenting and exhibit I also use

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,210
the camera to accept payment this is no

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,299
longer restricted to native apps you can

00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,710
no do this in the browser and the iphone

00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:18,419
so if we were thinking about for our

00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:20,429
museum let's say down the road if we had

00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,990
beacons and we knew that somebody was

00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:26,370
standing in front of an exhibit for a

00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:30,299
long time and museum administrator was

00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:33,809
wanting to do fundraising for building

00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:36,059
out more exhibits like this perhaps

00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:38,309
there's a possibility for doing some

00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:40,770
on-the-spot fundraising by collecting

00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:42,809
payment this way or converting people

00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:46,289
from visitors to members by collecting

00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:50,190
their information like this this is a

00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:51,750
cool one this is a project tango from

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,700
google so they put this in the target

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,409
stores last year to create a winter

00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:00,000
wonderland this is an augment reality

00:31:55,409 --> 00:32:02,250
and so play the video here they had

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,890
these tablets in the target store and as

00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,539
you moved it around it was taking the

00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:09,929
entire target store and turning it into

00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:12,419
a winter wonderland on the screen so you

00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:18,980
definitely see and again pretend that

00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:18,980
that the museum has unlimited budget by

00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:28,700
so i apologize i have to have a question

00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:28,700
here so are we breaking in five minutes

00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:37,140
alright and so guys this was listed as

00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,789
an extended session do you know if we

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,830
are breaking for lunch and then coming

00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:45,840
back or if we're going straight through

00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:51,360
and that may have been a false alarm in

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:55,679
between just there raise your hand if

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,940
you need a break in five minutes do ok

00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,750
we'll take a short break we'll take a

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,770
short bio break in in five minutes

00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,990
alright so again this might be something

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,240
interesting for the museum to augment

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:13,380
some of their exhibits that they already

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:16,620
have this is an example from a art

00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,600
studio in New York so there is no art

00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,230
displayed on the walls there are symbols

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,090
and once you scan the symbol you're able

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,740
to consume the art I'm not sure how I

00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:30,840
feel about this I just thought it was an

00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:36,080
interesting example by if you start

00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:40,679
thinking about kids let's say eight

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,630
through 14 8 through 12 okay let me back

00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,960
up so i'm at ikea and i'm dropping off

00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:47,640
my little kids in the ball pit and there

00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,510
were some older kids in front of us and

00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,039
was like well they're not going to be

00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,720
able to put them in there with it with

00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:54,270
the toddlers and they were getting the

00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,799
ikea scavenger hunt so it's a sheet of

00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,659
paper with all of these different things

00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,789
hidden in ikea they give the kid a

00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:01,950
pencil and as you're shopping you're

00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:03,450
your older child trails along behind you

00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,620
looking for these things and they get a

00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,380
prize at the end if they find all of

00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,260
them that's a really great way to keep

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,240
your 8 to 12 year old somewhat engage

00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,000
while you're shopping at ikea right so

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,740
it's thinking about this and what if

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,500
there are little things hidden

00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:21,810
throughout the museum like a scavenger

00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,030
hunt style for older kids to unlock

00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,250
right maybe the adults don't even see

00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,839
them and it's it's you know maybe to

00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:31,639
incense for the smaller kids but kind of

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,639
a fun scavenger hunt for the older kids

00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:40,149
alright so harnessing ambient data it's

00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:43,419
not just about one piece of the data

00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:44,679
it's about how can we combine one or

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:48,760
more of these are two and one of these

00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:51,879
together so for example and movement or

00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,440
I'm sorry I got distracted and in this

00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,200
example we're looking at movement in

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,490
terms of distance right so pretty much

00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,700
everybody's probably using some level

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:03,369
pedometer at this point on their app and

00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:06,099
another way that we can and other data

00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:07,990
that we can collect is acceleration so

00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:09,730
in this example with paper it's not

00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,980
counting how many steps that you're

00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,720
making it's actually if you tip the

00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,359
tablet it knows that you want to turn

00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,549
the page so that's acceleration versus a

00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:20,289
distance when you capture movement and

00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,210
then here's where it gets interesting is

00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:24,339
when you combine movement plus

00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,740
temperature or you combine any of the

00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:30,760
ambient data together so in this example

00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:33,520
this app basis you put it next to the

00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,220
bed or on your bed with you and what it

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,410
does over time as determines your sleep

00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,910
patterns and so my again my

00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,500
sixteen-year-old actually showed this to

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,240
me he's like hey this is really cool I

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,859
set my alarm now to wake me up in the

00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,930
morning so I'm up before seven-thirty

00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:50,170
but the app tells me the best time to

00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:52,450
wake up based on my sleep cycles I was

00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:56,049
like wow it's pretty excited my 16 year

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:58,210
old has come to terms with this so if

00:35:56,049 --> 00:36:00,069
you think about it well so this will go

00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:01,630
off let's say it seven o'clock in the

00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:04,359
morning for them well you combine it

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:06,609
with nest which is a smart thermostat

00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:09,490
and it knows that you want the house at

00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:11,500
75 degrees when you wake up these two

00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:14,819
things talk to each other your house is

00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:17,380
now at 75 degrees when you wake up and

00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:19,900
it's going to be collecting the

00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,549
information on a daily basis and having

00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,809
that adjust depending on what time

00:36:21,549 --> 00:36:24,130
you're actually going to be waking up

00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:26,470
based on your sleep patterns so these

00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,450
two things talking to each other can

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,020
create this really unique connected home

00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,020
experience

00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:38,210
all right does anybody have any ideas

00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,760
here so far that they would like to

00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:42,620
share it's okay if you don't have

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,210
collecting ambient data for our museum

00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:49,490
app all right so you guys in the back

00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:50,660
you first yeah and speak speak loud

00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:53,290
because I don't have a mic surpass

00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,290
around I'm sorry

00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,439
exactly that's it that's a great one

00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:12,269
that's something that we've come up with

00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:15,719
in the workshop of this guided path

00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:17,819
where you could select either your time

00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:20,249
window hey i have i've got two hours

00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:22,920
give me a grown-up tour give me the kid

00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:25,949
tour or i'm interested in this specific

00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,539
topic and then it gives you an immersive

00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:29,549
experience once you get in there and

00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:35,660
maybe it maybe it starts to rear out you

00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:35,660
around the student groups and then you

00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,200
ah

00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,150
yeah and that can build on his guided

00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:04,290
path so you know if you come in and

00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:06,630
there's only two hours left before

00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,760
closing it's like okay here's the high

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:12,440
the hot spots for you to hit before you

00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,440
get out yeah that's cool yeah

00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:23,440
start making their

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,540
that's a cool lady and I and that has

00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:49,140
not come out in the workshops of teasers

00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:52,170
right maybe a year might be you know a

00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:56,090
little long maybe me three months three

00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,090
weeks ahead this is coming up I think

00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,930
Oh

00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:13,380
exactly

00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:15,420
exactly yeah you're like yeah the path

00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,390
for somebody with school-aged children

00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,999
might be you need to hit these sites but

00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:22,170
it is real time and when we get into

00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:23,609
beacons we'll look at how would that

00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:29,359
actually work right so your routing

00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:29,359
people around and 11 more unbreak yeah

00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:39,989
good thing yeah we started and in one of

00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:41,519
the workshops we started going into

00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:42,779
designing for letting people kind of

00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,759
self segment so if you think about

00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:46,049
something like tinder like interested in

00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:48,239
dinosaurs yesterday or are you

00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:49,950
interested in this yes or no so people

00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,930
could specify that as opposed to like

00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:53,999
pulling their their actual demographic

00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,769
data letting the user preference kind of

00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:57,900
guide what paths that they would end up

00:39:55,769 --> 00:40:00,839
taking all right let's take let's take a

00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,509
little five minute break and come back

00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:07,589
and move on to the more interesting

00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:08,969
topics all right so now think we're

00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:10,739
still thinking about the museum we came

00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:13,469
up with some good ideas harnessing

00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,809
ambient data so the base capabilities of

00:40:13,469 --> 00:40:17,130
the phone now I want to level it up one

00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:18,630
notch and start thinking about what

00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,150
happens when we start connecting things

00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:23,369
so not just connecting two different

00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:25,019
types of ambient data together but what

00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:32,699
about connecting with other devices

00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:35,430
other objects their apps so remember I

00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:37,289
was talking about people shoppers are

00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,509
multi screening you probably do this

00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:43,140
yourself you may jump between your

00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:45,869
tablet to your phone or to the desktop I

00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,999
know as I am getting older my eyes

00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:49,559
aren't as good and so I may find

00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:51,690
something of interest on my phone but I

00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:53,489
ultimately go on to my desktop to buy it

00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,140
because the checkout process is a little

00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:56,910
easier for me it may not be a better

00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,869
user experience on the desktop but I can

00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:03,180
read it better so we jump around or

00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:04,799
we've saved something in the evening and

00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:09,660
we look it up at work when we're on our

00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:12,509
laptop and there is a huge move towards

00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:14,670
shopping and experiences on the T on the

00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:16,700
Smart TVs so that's something I think we

00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,740
all probably need to keep an eye on

00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,010
how that's going to be changing behavior

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:25,300
moving forward when you think about this

00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:28,250
and if people are jumping between

00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:31,070
devices between platforms to accomplish

00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,660
one goal maybe it's researching a

00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,369
something they're going to purchase or

00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:37,730
maybe it's getting tickets for the

00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:39,890
museum and it changes the way we design

00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,839
and it should also change the way that

00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,790
you test so this is a slight deviation

00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:46,099
from let's brainstorm from museum at

00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:48,050
this point in thinking about and a

00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:50,210
project that we worked on called silver

00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:54,140
car so silver car want wanted to

00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:56,290
reimagine a car rental for business

00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:00,140
travelers and so they bought a fleet of

00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:01,880
brand-new silver Audi a4s and they

00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,530
wanted to get rid of the lines and the

00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,849
paperwork and the waiting and all these

00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,770
different things that we experience when

00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:09,680
you run a car and so basically you would

00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:11,420
just booked a car on your on your phone

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,599
or on the computer and when you got

00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,460
there you would scan the QR code on any

00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,990
one of the Audi's it would unlock the

00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,030
car pair it to you and you could take

00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,220
off that's it you have to talk to

00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:24,829
anybody you didn't have to fill out any

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:27,260
paperwork and so when we worked with

00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:28,579
these guys we did the research going out

00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,349
into the field talking to business

00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:33,470
travelers all the way through all the

00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:36,470
production and parts of the development

00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:39,770
work across five platforms and we

00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:43,579
launched in the dfw airport in texas in

00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:44,960
january of 2013 and we were super

00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:46,250
excited there was lots of write-ups on

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,180
TechCrunch everything was going really

00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:52,700
well until we realize that QA this was

00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,310
our fault too QA had not tested across

00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,660
platforms they test it what happened if

00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,099
you booked on your iPhone and picked up

00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,839
on your car picked up the car on your

00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:01,160
iPhone and returned in your iphone they

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,619
test it what happened if you did it

00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,030
through the kiosk at the suite they test

00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:06,800
it what happened who did through desktop

00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,200
they did not test what happened if you

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,569
started on a desktop move to a phone

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,859
later use the kiosk back to the phone

00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:14,920
and then did your receipts on the

00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:18,800
desktop the whole thing broke down and

00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,510
so my takeaway lesson from that was we

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,790
have to work with our QA teams two

00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,770
things are changing for them they

00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,270
shouldn't be testing in a silo anymore

00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,800
just like we shouldn't InDesign for

00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,950
edurne asylum we shouldn't develop for

00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,020
it

00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:33,290
the silo and so let's make sure when we

00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,880
work with our QA teams that we have test

00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:36,980
scripts for them or we talk to them

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,210
about the importance of what happens

00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:46,730
when people are moving from device to

00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:49,160
device device so back to our Museum and

00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:51,110
brainstorming and talk about what

00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:55,490
happens if we were if we were connecting

00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:58,580
across platforms and so kendall has our

00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:01,130
amazon has a cool program called

00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:05,570
whispersync and so basically if you buy

00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:07,640
a book by a book on kindle and you have

00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,530
audible you can read your book in the

00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,030
evening and get in your car in the

00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,890
morning and turn on audible and he'll

00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,750
pick up where you left off and read to

00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,940
you when you get home that night it'll

00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,680
flip to that page and the on the kindle

00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,360
for you to read and it keeps everything

00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,190
sink so you can jump back and forth

00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,920
between the audible version of it and

00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:28,040
the kindle text version of it so it's a

00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,230
pretty cool program one of the things

00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,150
that Amazon does not do well but I think

00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:35,300
they may have just fixed at least they

00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:36,830
fix the film on one of my devices is you

00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,510
know like kindle when you download a

00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,490
sample and you get to the end of the

00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,980
sample and you buy it and then it

00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:45,520
downloads the real book and you open the

00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:48,440
book up it starts at the beginning again

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,420
even though they know you don't know the

00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,190
sample the samples on your device they

00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:56,150
know what page you left off on they

00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:58,760
don't drop you in the right spot so

00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:01,720
anyway I think there I think there

00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,550
that's something that they're fixing now

00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,800
but again across devices this is this is

00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:12,380
a good example so for our museum let's

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,780
think about let's say probably most of

00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,450
the visitors coming into the museum

00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:21,590
adult have a smartphone but do all of

00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:24,170
our kids have smartphones some people's

00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:26,720
kids may some people's kids may not may

00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:31,760
depend on their age range where you're

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,650
from how clumsy your kids are and so

00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,960
there's the possibility that museum

00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:38,390
maybe has tablets that you could pick up

00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,890
in those big bulky containers so they

00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,480
drop them they're still okay that you

00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,050
can pick up for the kids now would you

00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,630
want some

00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:47,540
ization from the parents app on their

00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:49,490
personal device and the museum device

00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,560
that the kids using is that possible

00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:56,150
something that we may want to have here

00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:59,780
so connecting across platforms we can

00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:01,580
also connect across medium so I think in

00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,980
museums a perfect example of this where

00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:05,150
they have a lot of analog content and

00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,280
we're thinking about how to create a

00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:09,380
digital experience that layers may be on

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,720
top of that in this example we've got

00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:15,440
the board game and this is using the the

00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,820
spinners as the digital piece of it and

00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,190
collecting the points and the game

00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:21,290
rewards but here's another one that

00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:24,890
thought was really cool is these talking

00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:26,630
statues so I actually got to see I

00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:29,240
didn't see this in London but when i was

00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:32,330
in copenhagen I got to see it I think

00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,830
the owner creator of fox TV put a lot of

00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,900
money and having these sculptures

00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,150
created and if you get up close to the

00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,800
sculpture it starts talking to you its

00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:43,970
eyes open it starts telling you about

00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:48,200
history in this example from the talking

00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:51,800
statues of London this is the i guess

00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:54,860
one of the cat examples here and you get

00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,330
to the statue and you scan it with you

00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:59,000
scan the QR code with your phone and

00:46:56,330 --> 00:47:00,170
then you get an incoming message so I

00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,700
couldn't find the Sherlock Holmes

00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,900
example but if you do this for Sherlock

00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,760
Holmes it actually when your phone rings

00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,250
it says incoming message from Sherlock

00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,720
Holmes you pick it up and it's Sherlock

00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,880
Holmes talking to you telling you

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,590
something about the history of sherlock

00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,640
holmes in the city and why this statue

00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:19,040
is here so i think that's certainly an

00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,620
opportunity to add some deeper levels of

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,430
engagement in the museum and I think

00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:28,160
maybe by using begins that we could even

00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:30,680
determine okay who's in front of me is

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,560
it a little kid or is it an adult are

00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,470
they on a museum device or a personal

00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:39,560
device how do they tailor the content

00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:43,469
for the person who's in proximity to to

00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:45,489
the statue or the exhibit

00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:47,289
alright the next couple of ones are

00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:50,079
about tvs which may or may not be that

00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:51,669
important in our Museum example but it

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,969
may be important for apps that you're

00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:57,160
working on today so with TVs you I want

00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:59,289
you to think about the possibility for

00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:02,169
mirroring this is a very simple way to

00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:05,789
connect with the TV but you can also use

00:48:02,169 --> 00:48:08,650
a smart device for controlling the TV as

00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:12,489
well as enhancing or augmenting the

00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:14,609
experience that's on the TV and then

00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:17,349
following on the tail that is

00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:20,829
interacting with the consoles so this is

00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:26,410
an example of combining connecting with

00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:30,160
consoles and wearables so I think this

00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:32,890
one is a Nike connect we took this idea

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,229
and plugged it into a product that we

00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:37,809
were working on last year for expert

00:48:35,229 --> 00:48:41,289
video network where a lot of the videos

00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:44,650
were around yoga and so what we realized

00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:46,539
was okay the the client came to us and

00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:49,539
she's like I want a nap I already have a

00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:50,829
website I want a nap and what I want to

00:48:49,539 --> 00:48:52,719
be able to do in the app is have it

00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:54,369
connect to apple TV and we're like okay

00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:55,900
that sounds like a really good start but

00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:59,469
what else could we do with it and what

00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:02,829
we came up with was if you're doing yoga

00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:05,650
and you've paired your phone with your

00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:07,509
Apple TV you no longer necessarily need

00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:12,159
to have your phone next to you playing

00:49:07,509 --> 00:49:15,130
the yoga video in duplicate and so what

00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,900
you could do is use the camera so that's

00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:20,380
some of that ambient data the camera to

00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:23,469
watch you and do a split screen so it's

00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,479
projecting the yoga video here and a

00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:27,039
silhouette of you here next to it so you

00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:29,890
can see if you're getting a pose correct

00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:31,929
and we were super excited about this

00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,699
idea we did a lot of a user testing

00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:35,859
around people were excited about it as

00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:38,019
well as a differentiator for their video

00:49:35,859 --> 00:49:40,479
network service they also said they'd be

00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:43,869
willing to pay to have the yoga

00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:46,269
instructor analyze their purchase or

00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:50,769
their poses and provide direct feedback

00:49:46,269 --> 00:49:52,539
to them and then right as we were doing

00:49:50,769 --> 00:49:55,119
the research for it we found out that

00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:55,540
connect nike connect training is doing

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,680
the same

00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:01,600
thing so this right here is the person

00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,040
who's doing the video their silhouettes

00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,500
being projected right next to the

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,520
instructor and we were said we were so

00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,310
excited this little brainstorming

00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,410
exercise had come up with the same idea

00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:13,990
that you know I guess we just kind of

00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,460
felt validated that it was it was coming

00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:20,500
out as well we came up with something

00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:23,140
really cool another option is you can

00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:25,240
connect with QR codes so like I was

00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:28,090
talking about silver car scan the QR

00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:31,150
code pair the car to you take off and

00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:33,220
leave in this example it's you're able

00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:35,050
to do shopping in the subway and have

00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:40,000
the food delivered to your house by the

00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:42,970
time you get home now let's talk about

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,490
smart objects so this is another

00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:47,980
opportunity to connect so this up here

00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:52,630
on the left is a smart egg tray it's a

00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:54,670
hundred dollars and there's an app to go

00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:56,020
with it it's your smart egg app and if

00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:57,970
you go to the grocery store and you

00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,090
forget we have eggs or not you can check

00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:04,210
back and see how many eggs do I have and

00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:07,000
how fresh they are then we've got

00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:09,220
something of similar silliness around

00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,740
the fork of counting how many bytes who

00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:13,150
take during the day the toothbrush how

00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,770
often do brush your teeth so all of

00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:16,720
these smart objects are kind of laughed

00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,280
at them because I'm like who wants to

00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,710
spend like a hundred dollars or more per

00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:23,110
object and have and more importantly an

00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:26,740
app for each of these objects to track I

00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:27,970
know mundane stuff like I value dental

00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,230
hygiene but I'm pretty good about

00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,940
remembering brush my teeth I really

00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:33,760
don't need this app to handle this for

00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:36,340
me but then you get over here in the top

00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,410
left corner to this Disney Magic Band so

00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:41,460
anybody been to Disney World and use the

00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:45,760
Magic Man you you've been all over huh

00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:47,140
so the the Magic Band is something that

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,480
Disney's released you go to Disney World

00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:52,420
and you get this and it lets you unlock

00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:54,370
the door of your of your room it lets

00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,750
you pay for things it coordinates back

00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:59,860
with your app I think does it track your

00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:02,590
kids do you know it doesn't track your

00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,270
kids it should track your kids right I

00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:06,270
guess you can't you can lose your kids

00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:10,470
and Disney World for sure

00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:11,970
it should track your kids so I thought

00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:14,190
that was a that's a pretty interesting

00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:16,500
smart object and so let's take a look at

00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:18,450
some of these so this is this is another

00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,880
expensive smart object that has its own

00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:22,470
app it's from a company in Austin are a

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,730
company in Austin that the design and

00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,740
development of this which is why I know

00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:28,710
about it it's a smart basketball it

00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:31,800
helps you perfect and your basketball

00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:33,570
playing so it keeps track of all of all

00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,950
of your different metrics to in order to

00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:40,230
help you improve this is lyric this is

00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:42,210
Honeywell's competitor to nest we got to

00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:44,310
work on this it's the smart thermostat

00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:47,070
it also has a smart security system it's

00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:51,740
basically objects in your home that are

00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:55,050
talking to your apps using a bluetooth

00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:56,580
now where I think the smart objects

00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,100
other than in Disney band could get

00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,690
really interesting is I don't want to

00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:04,620
spend a hundred dollars for an egg tray

00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:06,960
but if I ran a manufacturing plant I may

00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:09,510
be interested in spending more to have

00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:13,410
smart objects in my manufacturing plant

00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:15,510
so I see a lot of nods on this so I'm

00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,940
going to read the notes on so I don't so

00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:20,250
I don't mess it up so this is a sensor

00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:22,260
driven app and use my service teams in

00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:24,780
the field so the app connects to the

00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:27,960
Bluetooth sensors on the fan so in this

00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:29,640
example the smart object is the the

00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,640
piece of machinery in the production

00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,890
line so basically if the fan is going to

00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,900
have problems or having problems it can

00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:39,150
speak up and say not working very well

00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:45,440
or I'm not performing particularly well

00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:45,440
or I'm broken and then oops

00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:53,290
okay on this case or I'm out of

00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:56,750
alignment and then the if the fan

00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:59,390
indicates there's a problem it generates

00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:04,220
step-by-step instructions for somebody

00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:06,349
to fix it so we could have possibly less

00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:09,140
skilled labor at this point addressing

00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:12,410
the problems with the fan and the

00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:15,290
instructions have 3d rendering to

00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:18,050
outline how to fix the motor and then it

00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:19,520
checks the work the smart object checks

00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,050
the work and generates a report that it

00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,830
was fixed correctly and I believe

00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:27,349
there's also the possibility and for the

00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:30,560
person who's fixing it to get support

00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:32,930
from a permit from an expert elsewhere

00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,160
so like like I tried to do all of this

00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:35,599
and the expert would be able to see

00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,300
because it's a smart object what's been

00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:41,599
done so far and provide assistance

00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:43,849
remotely for fixing it that's pretty

00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,700
powerful right that's going to change a

00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:49,369
lot of what's going on in manufacturing

00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:54,859
wave much more than an egg tray does our

00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:56,270
personal shopping habits alright you can

00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:58,070
also connect with wearables so maybe

00:54:56,270 --> 00:55:04,310
instead of having like a small smart

00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:06,020
golf club you have a glove and then we

00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,160
have this one there's a bunch of them

00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:10,040
out there for babies right now to

00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,480
determine are they still breathing what

00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:14,680
are their sleeping habits these things

00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,680
in this example

00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,780
sorry I looked at this not long after my

00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,400
last child was born and I don't need

00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,100
this sensor it's homes we have the baby

00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,550
sleeping I know the baby sleeping cuz

00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:31,290
it's go ahead this one louder okay I

00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:33,270
know the baby's awake you know how I

00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:34,650
know because the baby's loud I've got it

00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,960
but then I saw this little piece here

00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:39,420
that says I don't know if you can read

00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,790
this but Austin is sleeping he'll wake

00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,290
up in about 45 minutes I was like wait a

00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:45,270
second that's that same thing as like

00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,770
the basis app where it's looking at the

00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:49,230
sleeping patterns and I'll listen I

00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:51,090
thought 45 minutes do you know what I

00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,650
could accomplish in 45 minutes I could

00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:54,480
like take a shower i could start dinner

00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:55,800
I could use it like there's a I could

00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,720
take a nap there's all of these

00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,910
different things and so in combining the

00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,560
sensor with this ambient data in

00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:04,280
starting to give us patterns this

00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:06,600
actually starts to become pretty useful

00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,520
going off of this we've actually done a

00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:12,830
lot more serious work in the medical

00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:16,680
space so we did applications for

00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:18,930
epilepsy medication adherence and when

00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,970
we started working with people who had

00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:23,040
epilepsy who are caretakers of people

00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:24,690
with epilepsy it turned out that it

00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,580
wasn't so much they weren't remembering

00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:28,530
to take their meds if you have epilepsy

00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,790
you already have a system in place a lot

00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:31,380
of people would just put their med in

00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:32,790
their pocket in the morning if it was

00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:35,940
still in there at lunch they hadn't

00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:37,590
taken it they didn't need a app to

00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,240
remind them and this kind of gets back

00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:41,190
to wait are we even designing the right

00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:45,060
thing is an adherence app really the

00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:48,810
right thing in this case it turned out

00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:51,060
that I what a lot of these caretakers

00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:54,620
and people with episode of epilepsy

00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:58,860
we're looking for work correlations and

00:56:54,620 --> 00:57:01,290
between symptoms and seizures and what

00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:04,890
you could do is use sensors like this

00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:08,370
and either on the body or in the bed or

00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:10,590
both that captured the seizures and that

00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:12,050
information would be transcribed here

00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:15,200
you combined it with some type of

00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:18,660
wearable you may also be getting other

00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:22,560
indicators and was the humidity today

00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:24,540
how active were you today how much of

00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,220
this did you can zoom today so these

00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,750
things all start together to create a

00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,200
picture to help people who are trying to

00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,650
manage

00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,480
Pepsi avoid triggers and that's when the

00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:37,170
wearables plus sensory starts to become

00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,150
pretty interesting I think this is an

00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:45,480
example of the of the Disney Magic Band

00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:49,140
and then this is from steady serve there

00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:52,410
is one of the folks from City serve is

00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:57,329
is in our class today so this is a local

00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:58,800
company and with our FDI they are that's

00:57:57,329 --> 00:58:03,200
what they're using to connect so we've

00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:06,089
got these sensors on the kegs and

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,910
through this they're able to monitor I

00:58:06,089 --> 00:58:10,890
do real-time beer inventory management

00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:13,230
so went back in the days when I used to

00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:14,460
work in restaurants we would be getting

00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,990
ready for the weekend and we go back

00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,579
into the cooler and we'd lift the keg

00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:18,839
and if you could lift it you needed to

00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:20,160
order more and if you couldn't lift it

00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:22,380
you were probably had enough for the

00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,390
weekend well this isn't a scale really

00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:26,250
well when you have 12 or more taps or

00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:28,680
perhaps all of your beer kegs are being

00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:30,839
stored underground you're not going to

00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:34,290
go back there and lift each one and so

00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:36,270
what these guys have done is have embed

00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:40,440
eric created the sensors that you can

00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:43,670
manage that remotely and one of the

00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:46,319
things that we found our research was

00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:49,589
that we didn't have to create an

00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:51,300
entirely point-of-sale system for people

00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:53,010
to place orders a lot of these bar

00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,109
managers if being told they were getting

00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:56,520
low on something they would simply just

00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:58,650
fire off a text message their

00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,290
distributor to order that's another one

00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:02,849
of going back to like what's are we are

00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:04,530
we even solving the right problem do we

00:59:02,849 --> 00:59:06,089
need to create this an elaborate

00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:07,650
application to handle all of these

00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:08,730
different things are are there different

00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:10,980
ways out there that people are already

00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:12,930
comfortable communicating we had no idea

00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,849
going in that people were comfortable

00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:16,440
just sending a text message to a

00:59:14,849 --> 00:59:18,240
distributor to place a large order but

00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:21,050
they were so why create a whole new

00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,050
system for them

00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:26,369
we can also do connecting with no with

00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:27,960
other apps so again a good example of

00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:30,569
that is a lot of recipe apps that are

00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,520
out there today and they built in

00:59:30,569 --> 00:59:34,650
shopping list because they couldn't talk

00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,200
to the other iphone shopping list apps

00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:39,359
that people were using but now with iOS

00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,760
8 you're able to have apps talk to each

00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:43,740
other so don't over engineer your app

00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,319
just leverage something that's already

00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:48,930
out there if most people out there using

00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:52,680
ziplist or other shopping list tools

00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:57,240
just be able to export to that so again

00:59:52,680 --> 01:00:00,990
in thinking about our museum app can we

00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:03,839
have it connect to its okay let's take

01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:05,430
this example the student we had the

01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:09,000
research for the student he went into

01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:10,890
the museum he had a hard time navigating

01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,380
to find exactly what he was looking for

01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:15,089
and when we you guys aren't privy to

01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,339
this research book but the story goes

01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:20,069
when he got home he realized the gift

01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:21,930
store had a book on the topic he was

01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:25,710
interested in and he missed it after he

01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:30,260
was already home so do we need to in our

01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:34,859
Museum at build out a gift store

01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:37,890
shopping cart and the answers probably

01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:39,990
not what if our guy was able to simply

01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:42,660
be notified that this book is available

01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:44,369
and or that there's a lot of books on

01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:48,869
this topic available and just order it

01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:52,440
straight through Amazon or apple and

01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:54,890
have it delivered digitally to his to

01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,890
his device

01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:03,540
you can also bring in data from other

01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,540
apps you don't just have to push it out

01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:14,450
so in this example you're bringing in

01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:16,480
data from the apple health kit so it

01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:18,890
sounds pretty interesting this haiku

01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,570
this little thing sits in your house

01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:22,730
well I guess it lives in your house and

01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:26,330
it listens for you not sure how I feel

01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:28,130
about that their gimmick to get you to

01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:30,530
use it is they have an iphone and

01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:34,460
android list shopping list app already

01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:36,860
out they say use our app and for

01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:38,540
shopping it's got nice synchronization

01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,340
so i can add things to the list my

01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:42,170
husband can add things to list teenager

01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,400
can add things to the list when i get to

01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:45,980
the store i can see all of those at the

01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,230
same time i say use our app and if you

01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:51,740
like it order haiku and then you'll be

01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:53,540
able to just and you know tell it's held

01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:55,520
a little microphone what you want or

01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,170
scan the barcodes this little thing

01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,910
lifts up and on the bottom that flat

01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:00,560
base it's got a little scanner so you

01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:02,840
can scan things in your house as you run

01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:04,730
out and so that's that's their hook to

01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:09,800
bring it in so smart device Plus app

01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:13,250
there another way to connect with other

01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:19,090
apps is by using the app if this then

01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:23,300
that has anybody tried IFTTT okay so and

01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:25,370
what this app does is it lets you guys

01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:27,560
all of this being proffers it lets you

01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:29,930
write a simple if statement so for

01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:34,030
example a simple if statement that lets

01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:34,030
you connect multiple things together so

01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:44,449
in this example up is a fitness tracker

01:02:40,729 --> 01:02:46,759
that you wear on your arm and it logs

01:02:44,449 --> 01:02:49,569
your sleep and your steps and all of

01:02:46,759 --> 01:02:52,009
these different things about you and

01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:53,869
let's say you also use Evernote for

01:02:52,009 --> 01:02:56,209
recording all of your health information

01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:58,329
maybe to take to your doctor but you

01:02:56,209 --> 01:03:02,539
don't want to like take the stuff from

01:02:58,329 --> 01:03:04,009
up and like personally rerecord it into

01:03:02,539 --> 01:03:05,809
Evernote for your doctor but you want to

01:03:04,009 --> 01:03:10,190
combine some other things in so you can

01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:13,759
use ifttt to take the information from

01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:16,670
up this is and basically every morning

01:03:13,759 --> 01:03:19,670
take the information from up and move it

01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:21,140
into Evernote for me so if we were doing

01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:25,910
something like for the connected home

01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:28,609
you could say and when I leave the

01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:31,219
office go ahead and drop the temperature

01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:32,959
in my house down to 70 and so then it

01:03:31,219 --> 01:03:34,759
would use location awareness for oh

01:03:32,959 --> 01:03:37,369
she's left the office she's on the road

01:03:34,759 --> 01:03:39,979
I will now go drop the temperature on

01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:42,440
her nest down to 70 so it's cool when

01:03:39,979 --> 01:03:50,779
she gets home this is a very very

01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:52,309
powerful tool to illustrate the power of

01:03:50,779 --> 01:03:55,369
this tool I will now show you a picture

01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:57,559
of a bunny because what speaks power

01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:59,660
more than a bunny and I found this

01:03:57,559 --> 01:04:01,519
yesterday one of my team members sent it

01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:04,579
to me it's a company called little bits

01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:06,499
electronics they give you a little they

01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:08,599
almost look like Legos they have sensors

01:04:06,499 --> 01:04:10,969
in them they're encouraging students to

01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:14,299
build things with these and the sensors

01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:15,859
can then communicate back to app so this

01:04:14,299 --> 01:04:22,069
little girl and her parents built this

01:04:15,859 --> 01:04:24,140
device using a little bit part and what

01:04:22,069 --> 01:04:26,930
it does is these are the little

01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:29,359
different sensors this is a plastic tube

01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:30,799
and this is the bunny rabbit and when

01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:34,130
this bunny rabbit runs out of kale

01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:37,369
they've trained it to tap this chopstick

01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:40,999
this chopstick goes down raises it here

01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:44,089
and then a little bits electronics they

01:04:40,999 --> 01:04:46,039
they used ifttt so in little bit

01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:47,130
electronics gets a message from the

01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:50,040
bunny

01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:54,200
sends an email to the little girl saying

01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:58,290
bunnies out of kale she's hungry then

01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:59,790
then what they did is the parents have

01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:01,170
got to be engineers right I know this

01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:02,820
like eight year old girl didn't come up

01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:04,970
with this letter on they started

01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:07,410
tracking at probably in a spreadsheet

01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:09,390
when was this happening when does the

01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:11,940
bunny indicate most or when does the

01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:13,860
bunny send the email most often and so

01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:15,600
it's when the Bene here's the owners

01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:18,120
coming home she goes over and starts

01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,890
pushing it and and then also when she

01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,900
hears the refrigerator door open this is

01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:23,640
the the most often time that she sends

01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:29,070
an email of give me more kale give me

01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:31,080
more kale all right would anybody like

01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:33,990
to share and I know that this middle one

01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,340
of connecting across devices is a little

01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:38,070
bit more challenging one but does

01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:40,530
anybody want to share examples of ideas

01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:42,600
that you have for the museum if we were

01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:48,110
to connect devices or connect with Smart

01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:48,110
Objects okay

01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,340
I can see something like

01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:55,410
God

01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,819
sir exhibit getting kids like maybe to

01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:59,160
round the corner and you're like some

01:05:56,819 --> 01:06:05,960
like trap doors drawer where he's at

01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:05,960
least leave your phone photos

01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:11,860
where you are

01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:15,039
is building with

01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,900
ok

01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:29,619
cool yeah like that you could get you

01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:30,490
could take that a long way right i mean

01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:34,230
you could have all types of

01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:34,230
interactivity at different levels yeah

01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:41,770
they start to get more active oh they

01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,470
need to see more entertaining you need

01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:47,640
to change them give them something

01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:47,640
you have a big papa

01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:54,970
yeah oh that made me think of it if

01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:56,530
somebody is standing in front of your

01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:57,910
exhibit and their pulse rate quickens

01:06:56,530 --> 01:07:02,080
it's a good time to hit them up for

01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:03,190
on-the-spot fundraising donation you

01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:06,970
seem excited would you like to donate

01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:09,090
five bucks to this exam okay that's

01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,090
creepy

01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:20,010
mm-hmm

01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:26,859
more information on that and yes and

01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:29,260
that was that the talking statues of

01:07:26,859 --> 01:07:31,720
linden that that was the good way to do

01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:34,240
it there i know that there are some

01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,280
challenges with putting in beacons and

01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,049
and the level of density of the folks

01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:40,049
around the beacons but ideally we

01:07:38,049 --> 01:07:46,180
wouldn't even have to make people scan

01:07:40,049 --> 01:07:47,680
the QR code on the exhibit and just know

01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,849
that they're right in front of it but i

01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,220
think that's going to be a couple years

01:07:48,849 --> 01:07:52,839
out before we get there so in the

01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:57,010
meantime i think that that makes sense

01:07:52,839 --> 01:07:59,670
to engage with it that way or tap good

01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:59,670
work yeah

01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:10,280
so for connecting devices i wonder if

01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,890
you have multiple kids if you can have

01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,540
them competing and maybe mom or dad has

01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:17,030
the scorecard and see how they're doing

01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:19,609
it can be like ello will Jimmy you you

01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:20,839
know brother has a few more over here it

01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:23,839
looks like you could go over there and

01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:27,250
get the hose or something I'm gonna I'm

01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:27,250
gonna hold on to you for a minute in the

01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:40,569
I just say print it yeah okay all right

01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,569
and then yours

01:08:44,869 --> 01:08:54,270
the right one it was the right question

01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:55,529
right place come alive oh that's really

01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:57,989
cool and you said you're on the Disney

01:08:55,529 --> 01:09:00,139
Dream is that a cruise ship or Disney

01:08:57,989 --> 01:09:02,609
Cruise has anybody else been on that

01:09:00,139 --> 01:09:05,670
Disney Dream did you guys hear what she

01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:07,799
said and there there are different

01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:10,109
paintings and once you got in front of

01:09:07,799 --> 01:09:11,549
the correct painting for that point in

01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:14,699
the scavenger hunt it would come alive

01:09:11,549 --> 01:09:18,139
and then give me the next clue that's

01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:18,139
pretty cool last one

01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:25,159
period

01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:33,770
that'd be that'd be really cool my my

01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:36,230
teenager suggested I would be cool if

01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:38,480
you're seeing this the skeleton it

01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:41,180
layered on the muscle and then the skin

01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,290
and then the sound and he's like and

01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:44,290
then the smell I make not the smell

01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:51,050
alright well the next one this this one

01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:53,780
is my favorite part of so we're already

01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:55,070
being and we're already pulling in the

01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:57,290
ambient data we're thinking about

01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:59,780
connecting right across devices

01:09:57,290 --> 01:10:01,160
leveraging other devices playing

01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:03,680
different things against of each other

01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:07,280
augmenting analog with digital but this

01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,540
one's about being hyper aware so and the

01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,760
way that we can be hyper wearing out is

01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:12,490
with this Bluetooth technology so these

01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:16,250
sensors are giving us additional

01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:19,700
information to create these exceptional

01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:22,520
experiences and as I was on my flight

01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:24,890
here I started rely I I was going back

01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,990
in my head over the past 10 years of

01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:28,910
projects I've died and I was going

01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:32,110
through one by one thinking about what I

01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:36,230
would have done different if we had had

01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:39,140
ambient data smart objects and Bluetooth

01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:40,910
sensors and there were a lot of projects

01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:44,690
we would have done totally different so

01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:47,690
we we did some work for Johns Hopkins

01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:50,750
from one of their nonprofits we created

01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:53,740
an app to help say moms and babe babies

01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:55,940
lives in third world countries basically

01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:58,190
obstructed birth is the number one cause

01:10:55,940 --> 01:11:00,560
of death of moms and infants basically

01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:02,600
baby stuck and if you're nowhere near a

01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,430
hospital in the baby stock and it's

01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,410
going to take a long time to get the mom

01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:09,260
transport it they may die in labor and

01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:15,320
this is what happens a lot so Johns

01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:17,540
Hopkins has a nonprofit called chip I go

01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:19,790
and Japan go had this thing called an e

01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:22,190
paragraph an e pardah graph was this

01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:24,380
long paper they had a whole bunch of

01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:25,640
charts on it and the midwives and

01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,520
birthing attendants were supposed to

01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,380
chart metrics like blood pressure

01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,360
dilation all these different things on

01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:34,790
the chart and if those dots started to

01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,620
move into this ad a danger zone they

01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:38,360
would know to arrange immediate

01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:40,970
transport so they could get to the

01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,000
hospital hopefully in time to do most

01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:44,910
likely a c-section

01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,070
and what they found was after years of

01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:50,280
having this apart a graph paper out

01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:53,010
there it was being used after the fact

01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:55,980
so after the mom and child had already

01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:57,870
died they would say sure enough these

01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:00,360
metrics would have alerted us to a

01:11:57,870 --> 01:12:01,950
problem like okay this is this is this

01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,000
is not working I'm paying the charts

01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,890
being used what's being used at the

01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,150
wrong time what can we do so they turn

01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:08,820
to technology and they're like well

01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:10,890
maybe we can have a digital clipboard

01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:12,840
where people fill this in and then

01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:14,490
they're like well maybe we can have this

01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,140
like system that's it almost looked like

01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:18,600
a gameboy maybe they could build it in

01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:20,100
digitally here and then the third thing

01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,140
that they tried was just a touch screen

01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,390
and even though the people that we were

01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:25,680
testing this on has never used a tablet

01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,150
before they never used a smartphone

01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:29,790
they'd never used any touchscreen device

01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:31,350
immediately we're able to use the

01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:33,150
touchscreen so we did a bunch of

01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:35,280
different design concepts for this and

01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:37,770
eventually came up with an application

01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:41,460
that's being developed in Copenhagen now

01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:44,100
and it's for a small android tablet that

01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:46,860
fits in the pocket that the birthing

01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:48,780
attendants chart these metrics and if

01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:50,550
the metric starts to go into that danger

01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:52,200
zone the nearby hospitals are alerted

01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:54,300
transports arranged and we move forward

01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:57,900
and I was thinking about this and I was

01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:59,790
like we wouldn't need this at all if the

01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:01,530
device is they were using to capture the

01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:03,450
metrics were smart devices there would

01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:07,460
be no human error there would be no

01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:10,680
human data entry it would simply be and

01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:12,690
being pulled from the devices itself and

01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,220
what an amazing world will be and

01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:16,820
medically when we get to that point

01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,820
right

01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:25,190
alright so back to the museum so one way

01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:29,510
that we can be hyper aware is through

01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:32,330
Bluetooth sensors so this thing right

01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:35,090
here where you can see this it's called

01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:36,740
the mother so one night I'm drinking a

01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:38,240
lot of wine I'm on Kickstarter or

01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:40,250
something like that was like oh this

01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:44,120
looks amazing i bought it totally forgot

01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:45,770
about it and this shows at like six

01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,930
months later i mean like two hundred

01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:50,930
eighty bucks for this bye they're like

01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:52,790
no more drunk text shopping am I in my

01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:54,650
house so I get this thing called mother

01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:56,810
it's about this big i plug it in the I

01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:59,210
start so I was like okay this is it's

01:13:56,810 --> 01:14:01,010
creepy it's really creepy it looks kind

01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:04,040
of cute sort of but then it gets creepy

01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:08,330
and it comes with these things they call

01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:10,220
cookies which are about about that big

01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:12,800
and you can stick them on anything you

01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:14,060
want the problem is you can stick a

01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,520
money thing you want but unless they

01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:17,990
have an app for it there isn't really

01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,640
any way to monitor it and they only have

01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:21,710
like eight or nine apps out of the gate

01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:23,030
like how much what are you drinking or

01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:25,850
how much coffee are you drinking how

01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:28,220
often does this door open is your kid in

01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:29,690
you know within your geo fenced area or

01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:31,100
not these type of things things that I'm

01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:33,380
not particularly really interested in

01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:37,280
tracking and but I wanted to try out

01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:39,470
these sensors so and these were pretty

01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:41,450
cool I put one on my snack cabinet and

01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:44,810
it turns out we go in our snack cabinet

01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:46,040
almost a thousand times today in a five

01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:48,980
family household so that was interesting

01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:52,430
and but so we've got these sensors then

01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:54,680
and I'm a skip ahead a bit here another

01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:56,060
example are these little metal tags that

01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,320
you can put on things from on your car

01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:59,390
up and them on your pet for them on your

01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:02,390
kid and then we've got the low-energy

01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:04,490
Bluetooth stickers this is by a company

01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:06,410
called estimate they also do beacons as

01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:09,800
you'll see here down in the bottom right

01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:11,480
this their logo has beacons in it but

01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,940
what I'm talking about here are the

01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:16,190
stickers so you guys might be interested

01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:18,320
in this they're just little as stickers

01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:19,840
you can order a pack of them it's a

01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:24,460
developer kit and then write your own

01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,460
app for whatever you want to track

01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:31,389
another example of Bluetooth sensors is

01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:33,730
when we were working for a silver car I

01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:36,909
already explained like how easy it is to

01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:40,449
pick up the car and and take off when

01:15:36,909 --> 01:15:42,550
you return the car and I should note

01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:47,139
this is only available in dfw they have

01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:49,630
12 locations but this example is just

01:15:47,139 --> 01:15:52,210
from dfw when you get close to the car

01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:53,710
rental return facility and the gate goes

01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:55,360
up and there's a low-energy Bluetooth

01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:57,880
sensor there that knows that you're

01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:00,760
returning the car it reads the gas gauge

01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,830
and immediately generates your receipt

01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:05,020
for you and then you just step out of

01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:06,969
the car and walk in so we thought that

01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:08,800
that was a pretty seamless experience

01:16:06,969 --> 01:16:10,690
for returning the car and feeling

01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,100
comfortable with your total before you

01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:17,020
left the parking lot but not having to

01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:21,010
talk to anybody another way to be hyper

01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:22,989
aware is geofencing so like I mentioned

01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:24,550
I work for retail me not doing design

01:16:22,989 --> 01:16:26,199
for a couple years and one of the things

01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:29,230
that we implement it was geo fencing

01:16:26,199 --> 01:16:31,210
around malls and other shopping areas so

01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:33,219
basically if you get near you have the

01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:35,469
RetailMeNot app installed you get near

01:16:33,219 --> 01:16:38,139
one of these things it goes to Ching and

01:16:35,469 --> 01:16:40,570
then it shows you all your deals so when

01:16:38,139 --> 01:16:44,139
we implement that engagement lineup by a

01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:46,239
magnitude of 4 so I mean it just way

01:16:44,139 --> 01:16:48,850
high and then i'll send it drop way down

01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:50,440
again like what just happened well we

01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:53,710
found out that people were going in and

01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:55,030
turning it off so they opted in but then

01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,590
they went in and turned it off we can

01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:58,449
figure out why and then all of a sudden

01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:59,800
we talked to a couple people so the

01:16:58,449 --> 01:17:02,650
beauty of user testing and they're like

01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:04,659
hate the sound I hate the chatting and

01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:06,639
so they turned off the whole feature so

01:17:04,659 --> 01:17:11,409
all we had to do was a mute sound and

01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:13,690
then our engagement went back up so

01:17:11,409 --> 01:17:16,449
another way that you can use geofencing

01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:18,460
that we explored this with retailmenot

01:17:16,449 --> 01:17:21,190
was not just to drive people into the

01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:25,360
shopping centres but to also create a

01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:26,130
customer loyalty on the time what do you

01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,530
remember

01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:30,870
I know you didn't offer to be the

01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:34,320
timekeeper win okay four minutes we'll

01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:36,780
wrap this up one of the things that we

01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:41,370
put in was a customer loyalty program so

01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:43,320
basically a three retail mean I an app

01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:46,280
if you were like safe flying delta you

01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:49,230
landed in an airport that was geofence

01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:52,320
delta could create rewards for their

01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:54,000
customers by driving them over to

01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,710
starbucks so it knows that you landed in

01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,690
the airport knows there's a starbucks in

01:17:55,710 --> 01:18:00,420
the next terminal it offers you a coupon

01:17:57,690 --> 01:18:02,220
to starbucks or a free drink at

01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:03,240
starbucks based on your loyalty so

01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:09,000
there's different ways to leverage

01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:11,010
geofencing this one's really cool so

01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,050
probably everybody is familiar with

01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:14,430
beacons one of the things that I thought

01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:16,080
when I first start reading about beacons

01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:18,300
is like for a museum that you'd have to

01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,560
put a beacon on every exhibit well you

01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,600
don't have to put it on every exhibit

01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:26,730
you can put like let's say one in the

01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:30,030
room and it has the proximity very near

01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:33,570
far an unknown and so you don't actually

01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:35,250
have to cover everything in beacons we

01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:38,280
want to show you this example of beacons

01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:40,440
plus geofencing so it wasn't really

01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:42,270
footlocker an rei it was other shoe

01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:44,760
stores but i'm going to use this as the

01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:48,150
example so basically footlocker put up

01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:51,000
some beacons and when footlocker

01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:54,480
customers got near the other shoe store

01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:57,660
it popped up head saying ninety-nine

01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,790
percent off at footlocker so they

01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:02,730
started using beacons and geofencing for

01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:04,950
conquest and you pulled up your phone

01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:08,490
here like ninety-nine percent off at

01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:11,760
footlocker 9897 you're like oh and then

01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:13,710
they have videos and people booking back

01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,970
to footlocker to go and make a purchase

01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:16,830
there by the time most people got a

01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:19,470
footlocker the coupon was down to like

01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:21,150
35 25 percent off but some people were

01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:24,420
able to run really fast and we get you

01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:28,470
know fifty or sixty percent off so again

01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:30,180
this is somewhat sleazy um to do and i'm

01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:32,760
not sure what regulations are going to

01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:35,070
be like in the future for having beacons

01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:37,710
in malls in airports in these different

01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:39,039
areas but i think you could think of

01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:41,319
some positive things for

01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:43,629
museum again we talked a little bit

01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:46,030
about some of them of rerouting people

01:19:43,629 --> 01:19:47,439
if there's a blockage hear of a whole

01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:49,809
bunch of third graders let's route

01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:52,839
around them and go over here or you know

01:19:49,809 --> 01:19:54,459
the the food area is full lets you know

01:19:52,839 --> 01:19:57,149
route around that and redirect people

01:19:54,459 --> 01:19:59,919
back down towards another peak time a

01:19:57,149 --> 01:20:02,019
big thing for retailers would be yield

01:19:59,919 --> 01:20:05,289
management right so if we have some of

01:20:02,019 --> 01:20:07,299
this information combined we've got the

01:20:05,289 --> 01:20:09,519
beacons we've got the geofencing and we

01:20:07,299 --> 01:20:11,519
have their data about when people are

01:20:09,519 --> 01:20:15,429
coming into their stores you can help

01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:17,619
stores that you're working for do offers

01:20:15,429 --> 01:20:19,719
that are time sensitive to drive people

01:20:17,619 --> 01:20:21,339
in like like happy hours right that's

01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:22,539
why restaurants have happy hours is make

01:20:21,339 --> 01:20:24,909
sure they're not empty at five o'clock

01:20:22,539 --> 01:20:27,219
you can do similar things let's say for

01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:29,369
a salon so people are in the area and

01:20:27,219 --> 01:20:31,839
they have some stylist who are available

01:20:29,369 --> 01:20:35,439
they have targeted offers driving people

01:20:31,839 --> 01:20:38,019
into the salon right there so beacons

01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:39,969
can provide timely information they can

01:20:38,019 --> 01:20:43,359
enhance the customer experience so this

01:20:39,969 --> 01:20:45,129
is clearly applicable for our museum and

01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:47,079
then if we think about what it does for

01:20:45,129 --> 01:20:49,659
the museum administrator this is amazing

01:20:47,079 --> 01:20:52,899
I get so excited when I see stuff like

01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:54,519
this I love data visualization the

01:20:52,899 --> 01:20:56,409
museum administrator would be able to

01:20:54,519 --> 01:20:58,299
see what what are people doing in my

01:20:56,409 --> 01:21:01,119
museum how long are they each display

01:20:58,299 --> 01:21:04,209
and what's the foot traffic this would

01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:07,299
be great fodder for writing grants let's

01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:09,369
get more money and I think that's a

01:21:07,299 --> 01:21:11,379
really interesting one and then of

01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:13,869
course beacons for contextual offers and

01:21:11,379 --> 01:21:17,639
then the gamestop example I provide it

01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:17,639
for an enhanced customer experience

01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:23,650
so we've had some samples from other

01:21:21,429 --> 01:21:25,570
workshops here this is one of my

01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:27,969
favorites mostly because somebody put a

01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:33,219
unicorn in the storyboard but that was

01:21:27,969 --> 01:21:36,760
kind of cute so at basically what I had

01:21:33,219 --> 01:21:38,800
the the different teams do is generate a

01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:40,480
whole bunch of ideas so they had a big

01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,460
piece of paper with three columns in it

01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,080
this is what I encourage you to try at

01:21:42,460 --> 01:21:46,659
work to get everybody with big piece of

01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:49,179
paper independently and have them fill

01:21:46,659 --> 01:21:52,630
in ideas in each one of these columns so

01:21:49,179 --> 01:21:55,150
the ambient data connectivity hyperaware

01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:57,369
and it doesn't matter where your sticky

01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:59,889
notes or your ideas fall just so long as

01:21:57,369 --> 01:22:01,840
you're generating a lot of them then you

01:21:59,889 --> 01:22:03,130
come back and you just do a really

01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,900
simple you don't have to be good at

01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:06,730
drawing really simple little story

01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:10,119
abortive wouldn't it be really cool if

01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:11,800
we got people to buy tickets at home

01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:13,510
download the app before they got there

01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:15,190
they don't have to show their ticket

01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,719
when they get inks there's a beacon all

01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:18,820
of these different things they could

01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:20,110
download books if they're in front of an

01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:21,340
exhibit that they're interested in

01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:23,260
instead of having to go to the gift

01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:27,219
store gift store gets the Amazon

01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:30,570
kickback stuff like that in this time

01:22:27,219 --> 01:22:33,760
we've got there was an itinerary

01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:35,650
automatically generated for him so like

01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,840
the ideas we had in the back there he's

01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:40,050
got two hours to do this it comes up

01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,760
with routing based on his interest and

01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:45,550
once he's actually in front of one of

01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:49,210
the exhibit the beacon would be able to

01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:52,150
provide applicable information in this

01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:53,800
way there was a redirecting or a

01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:55,090
question like hey are you hungry it's

01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,469
lunchtime you want to go to the food

01:22:55,090 --> 01:23:00,250
court you could pre-order something

01:22:56,469 --> 01:23:02,020
maybe and then this was a little bit of

01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:04,239
gamification that somebody threw in here

01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:06,969
so visit completed and achievement

01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:09,010
unlocked one of the ideas that i thought

01:23:06,969 --> 01:23:13,239
was absolutely fantastic is i did this

01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:15,670
workshop twice in portugal and a couple

01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:19,060
of folks there now not remember what

01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:20,739
it's called it's a little and they

01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:22,360
wanted to create gamification for the

01:23:20,739 --> 01:23:27,150
kids and it's around this little

01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:29,849
japanese toy that you feed and it grows

01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:33,239
isn't it what's it called

01:23:29,849 --> 01:23:35,209
that it yeah okay so basically they

01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:37,859
wanted to do something like that so as

01:23:35,209 --> 01:23:39,389
kids are going to the museum is they're

01:23:37,859 --> 01:23:41,909
going to these different exhibits and

01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:43,289
engaging with them they're unlocking so

01:23:41,909 --> 01:23:45,780
they're little they're little creature

01:23:43,289 --> 01:23:47,159
is growing or basically the egg hatches

01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:49,590
and then it grows and then they're

01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:51,749
feeding it the more they engage and then

01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:54,030
they're actually taking that home in the

01:23:51,749 --> 01:23:56,280
app and it's getting more information

01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:58,469
from the museum over that over time

01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,419
driving the kids to want to go back to

01:23:58,469 --> 01:24:01,679
the museum to continue to feed it

01:24:00,419 --> 01:24:03,269
because those little critters are very

01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:06,419
addictive apparently like kids

01:24:03,269 --> 01:24:08,309
absolutely love them so why not base our

01:24:06,419 --> 01:24:10,739
gamification on something kids are

01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:12,329
already responding well to and help them

01:24:10,739 --> 01:24:17,249
help them unlock all of these different

01:24:12,329 --> 01:24:19,619
levels all right thank you guys very

01:24:17,249 --> 01:24:21,629
much I hope this is helpful you guys

01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:23,579
will have a copy of the presentation if

01:24:21,629 --> 01:24:27,329
you want to use it for idea generation

01:24:23,579 --> 01:24:30,780
within your own company oh and I oh I oh

01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:34,699
books so I had a lot of people respond

01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:34,699
okay raise your hand if you responded oh

01:24:36,349 --> 01:24:42,780
can you just do a mad dash and whoever

01:24:38,609 --> 01:24:45,119
gets nose at the guy in the very very

01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:46,859
back you came up with the path based on

01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:53,209
itinerary like what you were interested

01:24:46,859 --> 01:24:53,209
in doing like it was a it was his

01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:06,510
