Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Open Data/Open Government Track

Abstract: As an advocate for OpenStreetMap, people often ask, “Hasn’t the world already been mapped?” But geospatial data in many parts of the world has historically been expensive or not available. Not anymore. OpenStreetMap and its committed mapping community have altered the geospatial data landscape by providing free, editable open data to people all over the world. This talk provides an overview of the OpenStreetMap project and a glimpse at the community behind it.

	00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,639
thank you

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,360
all thanks open for having me today as a

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,440
speaker

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,639
um i'm going to be talking a little bit

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,200
about the

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,199
openstreetmap project um mostly in the

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,480
us but kind of an overview

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,279
the community behind it and um what

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,119
makes

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,119
open uh street map open so

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,039
um like john said if you have any

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,240
questions it's always fun to have a

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,480
little more interactivity

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,480
even though we're all on our computers

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,239
so feel free to

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,079
interrupt me ask questions when i'm on a

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,320
certain topic

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,440
and make this as interactive as you like

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719
so with that

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,399
um my name is maggie cawley i

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,840
am the executive director for

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,480
openstreetmap us

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,920
uh we are a non-profit based here in the

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,399
us that advocates for educates around

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
and um kind of spreads the word about

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
the openstreetmap project and helps it

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
grow in the u.s

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,520
and with that who has heard of

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,519
openstreetmap

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,280
um you can indicate in chat usually i

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,240
ask people to raise their hands or stand

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,439
up

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,760
but you can stand up come on

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,200
the open street map project is an open

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
data project it's a collaborative

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
project

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,640
to create a free editable world map um

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,600
it's an open license

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,320
and volunteers and paid mappers all over

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
the planet

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,799
map their cities and towns and and areas

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,040
to build the best free open map of the

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,040
world

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,920
here's a little bit of history about the

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,400
project it was the story of

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,600
openstreetmap goes back to 2004

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,280
it was created by

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,680
a man named steve coast in the united

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,600
kingdom at the time the crown had a

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,079
copyright on all geospatial data and it

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,640
was very difficult to get any

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,560
data for your work or your projects

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,240
without paying for it

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,600
so his simple goal is to create a free

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,759
publicly available database of

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,880
geospatial data

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,600
here are some images of

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,160
the first edits in openstreetmap all

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,800
right

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
so in 2004 there were couriers driving

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,360
around the city

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,000
uploading their gps tracks to

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
a public domain and sharing them so

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
that's the picture on the left is

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680
there's initial

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,200
courier tracks and the picture on the

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,480
right is one of the first mapping

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,599
parties it was done

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,640
um on the isle of wight and you can see

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,560
all the different colors

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,640
are the gps units from the different

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,680
participants

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,760
maggie um as you're sharing your screen

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,120
i think you're sharing the application

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
instead of the entire screen which is

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,480
fine

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,640
but the other uh boxes that are hovering

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,000
over it we can't see them yeah those

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,760
so i don't know what those are but

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,959
they're just gray boxes on ours

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,480
so if you want to i don't know if you

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,440
can move those or if you want to share

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,160
your entire screen

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,879
either way but the those are greyed out

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
and

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,400
interrupting the presentation slightly

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,000
thanks for letting me know that i think

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,120
um

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,920
anything zoom covers it up so that's

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,959
unfortunate

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,959
um are you able to move them or

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:22,400
to the bottom maybe a little better

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
yes okay

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,720
all right um so yeah here's some of the

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,799
first edits and

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,560
uh here's the graphic that doesn't

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,519
necessarily show who's actually editing

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,040
but

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,599
um the idea took off pretty quickly as

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,599
you can see

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
it's uh gradually more people kept

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,120
adding to this database

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,040
and i think at this point we probably

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,159
scaled way beyond steve's wireless

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,080
dreams

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,080
these are the registered users across

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,599
around the world uh not necessarily the

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,480
number of people who

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,400
are actively editing um i think there's

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,319
a very sad

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
uh statistic that maybe half the folks

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,360
who register for an open street map

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,879
account actually make their first edit

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:07,040
so we're three four million people um

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,680
editing one of the questions i

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,120
often get and also probably many of you

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,000
in the open source community is open

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,680
it's community

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,120
data can i trust it um so i tend to

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,880
address that up front i always say yes

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
as the project has grown so have the

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,120
protocols and

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,720
the norms and the ideas around how we

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,639
make sure that the data going into

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,400
openstreetmap is

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,120
accurate so there's

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,240
a naughty word list so it's in dozens of

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,520
languages and the

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,520
data gets kind of screened for that any

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,600
major changes usually get pretty flagged

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,800
you know country boundaries and

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,560
um major highways uh

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
and you all know the old adage uh with

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,840
many eyes the all bugs are shallow

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,680
so same goes for openstreetmap and the

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,240
data

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,600
this is a screen capture of a high

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,880
school in loudoun county

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,280
maryland and i don't show this to say

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,759
that one map is better than the other

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,039
but more so to start showing how

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,000
openstreetmap really

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,479
gets into the ground level details and

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,160
its

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,240
uniqueness comes in the richness of the

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,479
dataset and the ability to fill in all

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,720
these gaps

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,080
so you know you can map the forests in a

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
non-map but you know an open street map

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,280
you can really get into the trees

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,840
so i often ask people who's making your

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,440
map that you rely on every day

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,600
do you know the person driving that car

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,720
or creating the app

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,400
and with openstreetmap um

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,080
you can know who's behind your map you

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,960
can look at every edit

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,080
and figure out who added that street to

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,080
your town or that

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,840
point of interest or the bakery and see

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,840
who that actual mapper is

00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,479
so what is so open about openstreetmap

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,479
first the obvious is the open data

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,759
how is the data being used how are

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,240
people

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,160
using it in things like code response

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,520
the other beauty of the open data system

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,199
and open stream app is the fact that it

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,440
can change very quickly

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,199
when covet hit very quickly the

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,319
community created tags to

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,720
start tracking places that were still

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,400
open

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,720
if they had coveted hours if they did

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,000
delivery

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,440
things change for opening hours if you

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,039
needed to wear a mask if they had hand

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,479
sanitizer you can see some of the tags

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,759
here

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,160
and mapathons quickly started being

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,520
planned

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,440
all over the world to help map areas

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,199
they're very localized areas to help

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
people can still

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,840
get access to the things they needed in

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,840
their towns um even with all the

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
closings

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,560
in france they created an app um

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,240
for sure my friend should accent sorry

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,240
seress uber um in this project uh

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,840
really took off because it was open

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,680
source it allowed

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,400
many other countries to jump on board

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,199
and um

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,919
spin off this idea to start collecting

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,440
data

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,280
around the resources in their

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,440
communities and what was remaining open

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,880
and what was affected by coven

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
this code is still out there i'm not

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,840
sure the projects are still

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,680
active but um such a really great

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,960
example of how the openstreetmap

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,240
community can come together and very

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,360
quickly respond to

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,039
changes in our world

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,520
another project i'd like to highlight is

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,199
uh by the chiochikas

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,800
juchikus is an initiative that began

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,479
around the open street map

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,919
community's annual conference in latin

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,360
america called state of the math it was

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,960
in sao paulo

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,639
in around 2016 and their goal is to

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,039
close the gender gap in openstreetmap

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,919
community where we estimate that

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,199
women represent maybe three percent of

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,879
the mappers globally

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,440
um hopefully that statistic has gotten

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,280
better over the last couple years but um

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,840
here's a project called lakaya de

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,879
nomujeres it translates to the streets

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,800
of women

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,080
and a group of women came together to

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
start mapping

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
the streets named after women in latin

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,759
america and spain

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,240
so they're linking the name of the

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,639
street to uh wikipedia articles

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,560
and um showing the gap that has

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,840
historically existed within cities

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,840
of honoring women and remembering their

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
achievements

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,760
another example of using openstreetmap

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,880
for change is resiliency maps

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,599
this is created in san francisco

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,519
and the group puts potential hazards as

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,159
well as shelter zones and resources that

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,560
are available to you during a disaster

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,279
there's a screen capture of the person

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,760
who

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,320
gave this presentation at our conference

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,800
in

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,080
minneapolis mapped the conference center

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
where the local hospital was where the

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,760
sos points were

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,600
and potential water sources so there's

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,320
this is free this is open source and you

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,959
can

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,000
create a map of your own city to um

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,080
print out and have

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,040
as on hand to see where all these things

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,160
are around you

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,920
and it draws on openstreetmap data

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,480
hey maggie we got our first question

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,200
great is there a governing body for

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,320
policy

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,440
and as mentioned naughty words or is it

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,120
member driven

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,800
very interesting and up-to-date spirit

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
node

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,160
i will get to that question um in a

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,440
couple of slides

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,080
so thank you for that stay tuned

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,200
i'll keep going and then just stay with

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
us

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,720
um most recent i worked with a fellow

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
this summer

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,360
to use openstreetmap data to measure

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,640
sustainable development goals

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,160
in cities across the u.s and part of

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,720
that analysis was to look

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,480
at the completeness of openstreetmap

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,680
data versus

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,080
open data it's open city data and here's

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,279
a screen capture of

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,399
some of the maps he made of open space

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,519
in baltimore so parks

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,720
cemeteries um places where

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,360
you know commuting outside what's

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,880
considered open space and he found that

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,640
um open street map was just as if not

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,680
more complete and most of the cities

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,120
for measuring um at least the open space

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,600
sdg

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,040
and you can see in the center can't

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,079
point to it you can't see me pointing

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,360
um the red areas are all golf courses

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,320
those are the ones that we're missing in

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,399
openstreetmap

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,560
and we didn't include them in

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,399
openstreetmap as a public space because

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,959
you have to pay to go to golf course so

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,279
that was

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,480
a very nice finding um and we have a

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,320
video of this

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,800
this full report if you're interested in

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,000
sdgs

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,160
we've got another question yep uh they

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,760
say steve jernigan says my company

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,279
currently pays for commercial mapping

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,320
services what are the limits to

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,279
commercial companies

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,720
using osm i think we'd happy to be to

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,320
pay to ensure the longevity of the

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,720
service and offset costs

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,519
good question well there are many

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,360
companies

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,720
probably lower yours relying on

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,839
openstreetmap um

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,959
and here are just a few of them that was

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,480
the perfect tee up

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,240
for this next section what i'm going to

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,640
talk about

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,320
so a lot of these companies have started

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,880
using openstreetmap and relying on the

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,920
data

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,040
for their their projects and for

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,480
many things within their companies um we

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,240
have also

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,079
seen the number of edits from these

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,040
companies go up so in order to ensure

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,720
quality these

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,800
these companies are putting money into

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,560
paying mappers and

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,040
creating their own tools for quality

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,160
control within the organizations

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,959
to um help the openstreetmap community

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,279
and also make sure that they can rely on

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,079
it

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,200
um another thing that these companies do

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,279
is they drive traffic from other

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,040
industries so government and ngos

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,639
and they they bring openstreetmap to

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
other constituencies and and really

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,079
spread the word

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,079
and they have the the resources to do

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,560
the volume work like fiction production

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,200
errors

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,360
uh for routing and contributing to the

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,000
tools we use to edit to query

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,040
um to export and even rendering out our

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,240
satellite imagery

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,600
for relief efforts and for tracing

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,720
um so i'm not sure if that completely

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,120
answers your question but

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,959
the big answer is yes i think if you are

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,560
interested in not paying for

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,040
commercial data is something you could

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,480
look into and

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,240
think about how these other companies

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,959
have incorporated openstreetmap into

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,480
their product

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,560
and changed their models to

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,440
contribute to the project and give back

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,959
to the community in a way that also

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,880
can ensure better quality for what

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,800
you're looking for

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,079
all right so i get to it i can't see you

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,279
steve let us know if that didn't answer

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,079
your question but that sounds like a

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,120
good answer to me

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,399
okay thanks okay so um

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,880
here's a kind of a smallest

00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,000
not exhaustive list of other places

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,480
using openstreetmap data

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,040
in 2012 foursquare changed strava

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,200
recently switched to openstreetmap

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,440
um pokemon go change to open street map

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,560
um niantic switch osm base maps from

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,079
google in 2017.

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,079
uh there's i won't go into a

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,680
rabbit hole there but they're with

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,639
gaming there's always a chance that

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,760
people will create

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,680
um data that helps them win so we've

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,839
definitely learned a lot from pokemon

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,839
and niantic using openstreetmap

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,240
and then there's the humanitarian sector

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,680
um

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,000
it was anticipated from the early days

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,519
of openstreetmap that um open free

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
map data would be a tremendous benefit

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,920
to humanitarian aid and economic

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,040
development

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,920
and in 2010 that idea was proven with

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,720
haiti earthquake in an organization

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,680
called

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,160
hot the humanitarian openstreetmap team

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,480
was

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,760
incorporated in that aftermath and now

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,600
10 laters

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,079
10 years later they are growing

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,000
um by leaps and bounds and their goal

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,720
and ambition is to put one billion

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,480
of the world's most vulnerable people on

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,600
openstreetmap by 2025.

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,639
uh they they respond to disasters

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,240
across the world and really bring in

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,839
a lot of edits and mappers into

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,480
openstreetmap as well and contribute a

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,560
lot to the data

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,360
here's a project they did to map for

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,560
malaria elimination they were

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,639
mapping buildings that had been sprayed

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,839
um within the community so you could

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,880
track so they had

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,040
folks out in the field with sprayers to

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,320
um make sure that they were covering all

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,760
the different houses in the communities

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,199
we had to talk about humanitarian open

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,399
stream map team for a while but if

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,160
you're interested in them and check out

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,839
their website

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,000
um amazon also uses another question

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,600
uh no actually do you mind adjusting

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,760
your webcam just a little bit

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,959
we don't see your eyes very much mostly

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,600
it's your mouth

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:05,040
oh that's awkward i can't see myself so

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,639
recording that's funny great is that

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,240
better yeah

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,360
okay um amazon uses openstreetmap to

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,760
deliver your stuff

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,480
and actually fairly recently their

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,800
couriers

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:22,160
started um correcting roads driveways

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,800
service roads and um updating

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,320
addresses so i'm not endorsing amazon or

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,880
any of these companies but they're just

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
useful

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,959
data examples to show how much

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,959
openstreetmap has grown

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:38,079
and how many people rely on the data

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,800
may i ask a question about that one

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,160
are they um are they active contributors

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,360
at all or are they mostly just

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:49,759
um using it very active contributors

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,880
so that's that slide i showed a few back

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,399
of the growth of

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,120
contributors that was the number of

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:59,120
edits that are made by these companies

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:02,560
not the actual use of the data so um

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,959
i think the to call it corporate editor

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,839
participation in openstreetmap has

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,440
increased drastically over the last few

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,560
years

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,440
we do have another question yeah can

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,240
openstreetmap

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,639
access the census api for thematic

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,639
mapping

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,279
um i would

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,720
i wouldn't see why you wouldn't be able

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,720
to combine the two um

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,600
so back in 2010

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,880
was it much of the mapping

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,800
you'll see if you look at mapping in the

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,040
united states it kind of

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,000
spikes and a lot of that is because the

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,399
data that came in

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,160
is from the 2010 um u.s census

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,199
tiger roads so there's actually a layer

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,519
now

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,720
in openstreetmap you can see the the

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,320
census tiger layer

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,079
for the roads across the u.s and people

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,880
have been working to fix that and

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,559
align those roads for very many years

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,480
but um

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,919
i mean you can pretty much do whatever

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,520
you want if you're saying is your

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,919
question for the money mapping if

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:16,959
but not directly from openstreetmap.org

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:20,400
okay um okay

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,839
so open stream app is open because of

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,360
the data but it's also

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:29,280
um open source and there are many

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,280
um projects that

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,600
are built on openstreetmap or are

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,720
adjacent to openstreetmap that are

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,080
not necessarily about the data but

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,919
there's a diverse constellation of

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,360
projects there's command line tools

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,280
like hardcore c plus plus backend

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,480
tools front-end projects like the id

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,160
editor

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,880
on the rendering side there's leaflet

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,320
and map nick and

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,520
the thing that makes it interesting is

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,200
like none of these projects are

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,799
specifically tied to openstreetmap

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,440
they're part of the ecosystem

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,120
and you can use most of them on a

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
non-openstreetmap database so they're

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,600
being built for openstreetmap they're

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,559
being built with the norms of the

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
community

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,400
but any project can be part of something

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,039
else as you all probably know with

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,559
open source that's kind of the beauty um

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,880
so there's different ways to contribute

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,080
and that means that we have a very

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,760
uh diverse community of folks we have

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,520
mappers we have developers there's the

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,880
data consumer side

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,039
local regional communities and

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,840
governments um humanitarian groups

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,840
all over the world

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,679
it's a little bit about the community um

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,559
there was a survey recently we did for

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,000
the openstreetmap us community and

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,919
uh these are some of the things that

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,120
people said is the reason they started

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,120
mapping in openstreetmap

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,120
and what really came across is that

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,480
people take pride in what they map

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,480
place is very personal

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,919
there were many of these and it was

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,679
really fun to read them all but

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,960
i like the last one an open map database

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,240
is a major benefit over the world and

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,880
that really is what keeps a lot of

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,880
people mapping

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,400
so why is this important well

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,080
i wanted to put kittens in the

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,640
presentation so i don't believe that

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,600
some things

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,559
just shouldn't be locked up data needs

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
to be accessible

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,080
and openstreetmap allows for the

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,200
democratization of data

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,200
and really prevents a monopoly on place

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,039
everything you add to the map belongs to

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,840
you you can export it you can use it to

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,840
make your own maps

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,039
you are also able to see like i said

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,640
earlier who is contributing data to the

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,520
map who's in that car

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,360
driving and adding the roads um every

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,000
change that is connected to a mapper

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,440
a human person and you can even click on

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,559
that mapper's name and send them a

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
personal message

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,559
uh here's a change set of that login

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,080
valley high school i showed earlier

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,600
you can see who took the time to map

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,799
every picnic table

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,919
in the high school campus

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,840
maggie is it hard to become a

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,400
contributor

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,640
it's not would you like me to show you

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,919
how to edit

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,520
sure how am i doing on time

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,440
you got time okay um

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,760
you guys are teeing me up so well how do

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,240
you get the data into openstreetmap

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,760
so it's as simple as the wonderful

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,200
another thing about this as an open

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,400
source project is that it

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,360
it's a very low barrier to entry as far

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,640
as

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,120
technical knowledge so you go into

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,120
openstreetmap.org

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,960
you sign up for an account you check

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,000
your email

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,799
and then you're in the id editor is a

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,640
good option

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,840
for making simple edits and for getting

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,640
started

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,240
so once you have your account you log in

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
and you click the edit button up in that

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,080
top left corner

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,000
and you start tracing buildings or

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,080
drawing roads or zooming into you can

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,919
search for your home hometown

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,520
and see if your school your high school

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,600
has been mapped or your

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,640
the road near your house has the correct

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,559
name and

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,080
if it's if it's not correct you can go

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,720
in and change it and start

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,280
exploring what the data is like in your

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,400
area

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,120
um so here's this is just if of you know

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,600
you zoom in

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,480
you can see that that building has not

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,480
been added

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,840
because it's not outlined in red and

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,559
here the person is

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:33,520
just outlining that building

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,120
doing as best they can to do the real

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,640
footprint on the ground

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,320
and then on the left side is where you

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,960
tag it so it's a key tag

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,840
pair system you want to say building

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,000
equals yes

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,679
so um the editor id editor makes it easy

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
there's a search bar you can search for

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,039
building

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,799
click on building and then it's tagged

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,640
and that building is now available

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,960
if you were to download the data set you

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,559
could get just those buildings

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,960
to be able to use in your mapping

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,960
projects

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,960
there's also opportunities to map

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,840
outside of your office or

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,280
desktop there's a lot of different field

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,039
and mobile mapping

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,120
editors and ways to contribute here are

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,640
just a few of them again this is not an

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,919
endorsement so this is just some of the

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,919
ones that exist

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,400
uh there's one called field papers that

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,280
you can actually print out

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,480
the screen of openstreetmap go outside

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,400
add the names of your

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,600
local businesses the opening hours and

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,559
then go back in and

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,600
and either um use the qr code to scan it

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,919
in and edit

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,760
that way in the id editor use it as a

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,200
way to take notes of what's been mapped

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,400
in your area

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,760
map stop me you can use for routing

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:48,320
same as other routing services

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,440
but you can also if you're if you're out

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,520
and

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,840
you see that the hours are wrong at your

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,360
local

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,280
is something you can go in to mask me

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,919
and check it and and add data

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,679
while you're also getting yourself

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,280
around town so there's some really great

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,120
things that people have built on

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,679
openstreetmap and

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,120
through the community maggie there's

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,640
another question

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,799
um are there any plans to add variables

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,919
such as speed limits or stop or yield

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,640
sign

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,400
they're in there awesome yep

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,559
um so yeah when you add a road you can

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,360
say it's primary choice you can add this

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,320
one way or speed limits or you know all

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,679
kinds of tags are

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,880
available within um the tagging schema

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,280
so getting back to the question of how

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,799
this is organized uh well

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,720
the simple answer is not really it's a

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,200
data commons right so part of the power

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,520
is

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,679
of openstreetmap is just derived from

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,919
its decentralized nature

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,200
but there is um the openstreetmap

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,559
foundation they

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,360
uh are responsible for setting

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,799
up the servers they maintain the

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,240
trademark and the license

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,240
and they have

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,440
seven five here but they have seven

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,080
volunteer board members a part-time

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,360
assistant

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,200
and many volunteer working groups

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,320
that people get involved with so it's a

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,559
foundation mainly run by volunteers

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,360
and they make sure that we are able to

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,360
access the data

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,480
within that foundation there are local

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,000
chapters mainly represented by countries

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,679
and that's where openstreetmap us

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,720
recently became a local chapter

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,320
and we are also

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,240
mainly made up of volunteers we have a

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,559
staff of one which is me

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,320
five volunteer board members and we have

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,240
a membership system here in the us so if

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,320
you're a member of openstreetmap us

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,200
um get discounts to our events and you

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,240
can vote for our board which is

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,400
great we started in 2010 um

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,440
mainly to hold our annual conference uh

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,600
we have

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,039
had nine state-of-the-art u.s events i

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,400
don't know if any of you maybe have

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:56,640
come to one but initially we were

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,919
there to convene the community and bring

00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,520
people together

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,760
um and share our open openstreetmap

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,120
stories

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,279
we have grown beyond that now um for

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,360
nine years we were an all volunteer run

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,240
organization and i came on last year's

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,720
first paid staff um we hold local and

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,200
virtual events here's a picture of when

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,200
we could

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,279
get together that was last year uh to

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,240
celebrate openstreetmap's 15th birthday

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,240
and now we hold

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,000
um bi-monthly mappy hours

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,159
we're putting together our first virtual

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,960
event this month it's actually next

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,159
weekend

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,840
um our organization supports local

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,520
groups so there's meetups across

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,039
the country there might even be one near

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,679
you um

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,320
local communities get together and map a

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,360
lot of it's

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,080
virtual right now but um

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,320
one day we're back together our

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,600
organization also has charter projects

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,000
one of the initiatives i'd like to

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,679
mention is called teach osm

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,279
and the goal of teach osm is to bring

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,559
openstreetmap into the classroom

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:03,679
so um last year and

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,559
for the last few years of teach usm has

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,679
held workshops for teachers here's a

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,440
couple pictures of

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,880
a workshop for um 50 ap human geography

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,480
teachers that we had in new york

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,720
and teachers go out and they learn how

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,840
to map and then

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,799
um come in and and you know hammer

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,320
through all of their

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,760
their questions and then they bring it

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,760
back to their classrooms and integrate

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,600
openstreetmap into their lesson plans

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,919
so teach osm is there to support those

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,120
efforts and grow that network of

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,200
teachers educators

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:39,840
and other folks who want to help

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,840
young people learn about it that you met

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,279
okay so that's that's it how can you

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,000
contribute

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,240
um you can sign up for account like i

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,840
showed you

00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,480
openstreetmap.org it's free uh you can

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,440
go in and make your first edit right now

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,600
contribute code to the tool sits attend

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,200
one of our events most of them are free

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,720
you can become a member of openstreetmap

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,039

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,120
support our projects

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,080
so with that uh here's some additional

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,240
resources

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,159
of the things that i've shared if you're

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,120
interested in diving deeper into any of

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,840
those

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,720
um i can share this presentation with

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,360
organizers

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,840
and um yeah that's it thank you very

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,840
much

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,960
awesome we got a few other questions um

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,559
forgive me if you if you did get this

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,039
one earlier but the first question that

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,760
came in

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,320
the is there a governing body for policy

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:40,240
i didn't notice if you did answer that

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:43,520
okay um governing body for policy

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,320
so each it really depends on what part

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,760
of the

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,080
infrastructure you're talking about

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,080
there are policies around creating new

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,880
tags there are policies around

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,159
um importing data so for that tiger

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,760
import there's

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,279
there's ways that you would bring in a

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,760
large data set an openstreetmap there's

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:07,039
within openstream ips we have a um

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,679
code of conduct uh so there's no

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,039
police or like someone really in charge

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,039
but there's these other

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,080
groups that are watching and making sure

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,279
that things

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,039
things kind of run a little bit more

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,039
smoothly yes i can show that's fine

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,080
and um do you have a link or a way to

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,000
share some of your slides or

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,960
your um any of your social media

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,240
information you'd like to share

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,360
sure um i can share this

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,159
is there something you would recommend

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,640
for sharing the slides

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,080
um it depends is this uh is this in

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,440
google slides is this in

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:55,440
powerpoint it's in google slides

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,279
uh you should be able to do a view only

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,559
share link out and then throw it in the

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,159
chat if you wanted

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,440
okay then i'll stop sharing and do that

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,440
so you all don't see my email

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:12,720
does anyone have any other questions or

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:15,840
anybody out there a mapper

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,840
i want to bmf

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,000
i've done a little myself um at my

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,520
company

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,399
working mostly with esri products but um

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,279
it's been it's been interesting so i

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,960
didn't share this

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,760
i i wasn't sure who would be

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,600
participating in this talk but um

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,159
there's now a new

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,320
there's an editor called rapid it's uh

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,840
ai machine learning assisted mapping

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,240
um and they have integrated um

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,320
esri is working with facebook to bring

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,320
in government data sets so

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,880
they have contributed to this editor to

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,720
change it so that you know you can

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,799
bring in the road file or the addresses

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,799
of alexandria for example and

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,760
the mapper checks off to make sure that

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,440
things are right but they don't

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,880
necessarily have to draw anything

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,520
um and also you can use the arcgis now

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,360
to

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,240
directly edit it in openstreetmap they

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,399
have a an online editor

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,640
interesting and the tool is called rapid

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,640
yeah

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,480
it's a fork of the id editor that's been

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,720
changed to have

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,720
um

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,640
assisted mapping sorry i was just

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,640
getting like there it is

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,080
it should be view only so if you want to

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,600
check that out

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,880
i went through anything too quickly

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,240
okay and while you're getting that

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,960
there's another question what is the

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,120
underlying

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,600
infrastructure of openstreetmap how's

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,840
everything stored

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,480
on giant servers like really physical

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,600
ones

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,200
um are you asking but it's built on

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,200
i don't know to be honest

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,840
okay um let's see

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,799
there's a question about uh funding um

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,480
obviously if the data is submitted or

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,440
people are able to edit things that's

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,200
community driven um but the funding that

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,200
is needed just curious where that game

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,960
comes from

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,640
uh historically for openstream f us

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,399
we've

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,240
not needed to raise a lot of money

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,840
because we were all volunteer driven

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,640
so um we would raise money through our

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,159
community events and same goes for the

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,240
foundation they would have um

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,600
server drives because it is i mean i do

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,200
know where it's store destroyed on a big

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,240
server in the uk

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,760
and adding capacity to that

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,799
all over the world has cost money um

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,399
so you know we have a server here in the

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,519
us and we have to pay for that through

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,880
openstreetmap us

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,720
you know we raise money through our

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,039
events through fun drives

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,559
um kind of like at your local radio

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,360
station

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,320
we put our hat out and ask for money um

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,919
i don't think that

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,640
any i should couch that i'm not sure

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,240
that any

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,679
organizations have received like grant

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,480
funding or

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,000
um besides the humanitarian open street

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,000
map team

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,159
it's mainly been individual incorporate

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,440
donations

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,480
got it okay

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,840
um and then for those that do contribute

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,960
oh is there a how many um

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:33,440
approvals doesn't an edit go through

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,279
before it goes live none okay

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,720
so if you want to edit right now it'll

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,399
go live um

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,840
what usually would happen is it would be

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,080
a reversion of a change set if it was a

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,279
vandal

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,840
or a vandalism or an incorrect edit um

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,440
and most of the time if you do something

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,720
that's incorrect we like to give people

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,159
the benefit of doubt you'll get a

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,360
message that says hey did you realize

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,279
that you drew a building over a road

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,039
maybe you should you know work on your

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,960
technique

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,799
so yeah is anything you add it right now

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,399
will be live in a matter of

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,720
seconds if not minutes depending on the

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,720
server

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,440
okay another question mark asks how do

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,760
you handle politically sensitive areas

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,480
like

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,480
military site

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,080
uh this is a tough one um there's

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,720
there's definitely eyes on those areas a

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,120
lot there

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,279
i i believe i'm fairly new to the

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,880
governance of this project

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,320
but i believe there has been a few

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,799
situations in the past

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,240
where people have had to watch closely

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,760
borders

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,399
but luckily i feel like they've

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,000
figured out how to maintain that i mean

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,640
get up getting a notice if something's

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,760
edited

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,399
um we do have a data working group and

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,159
um the board is pretty responsive as

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,799
well so there's people with eyes on

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,320
on things like that you can't just turn

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,559
it off for editing but

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,559
um

00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,760
okay i'm sorry i'm looking for the

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,799
editor

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,799
link for rapid

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,119
somebody just put that in as a question

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,200
actually you could if you're into code

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,560
you can contribute to this project

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,760
there it is we do a lot of things on our

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,480
wiki

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,879
um so any of those rules or regulations

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,159
or

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,480
uh guidelines that you would be looking

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,440
for on how we govern things uh would be

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,560
in that wiki

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,200
um like our tagging guidelines and um if

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,280
you wanted to introduce a new tab like

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,040
for example i mentioned the cova 19

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,800
tagging schema like

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,040
you have to kind of go through these

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,320
steps to make sure the community says

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:49,599
yes this is a good tag we wanna

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:52,159
use it

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,560
all right uh do you store contour

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,560
mapping

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,839
there is a layer um within openstreetmap

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,720
that you can turn on so if you go into

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,720
openstreetmap.org there's um

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,599
i could show you

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,839
there's different layers like cycle map

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,839
transport map

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,400
and you can add them on top so

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,839
there's opportunities to to add your

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,920
your topo or your contours

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:35,119
within that but they're all

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,280
separate from the main i'll just remove

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,280
these

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,359
there's a lot of offshoots of

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,320
openstreetmap too so there's an open

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,480
historical map

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,359
open railroad map open ocean floor map

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,480
open

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,560
you name it map that have a lot of

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,160
information that you would

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,320
maybe it's not necessarily appropriate

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,359
to be in the main openstreetmap

00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,839
database but um is still interesting and

00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,839
necessary

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,040
sure open historical math is actually

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,280
pretty cool

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,119
you can use a time slider and see how a

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,240
place has changed over time so like i

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,200
can go map and map

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,480
go back and map baltimore in 1950 and

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,079
then

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,079
see how that has changed

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,640
someone's raising their hand i think

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,640
hughes

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,839
grant did you want to say something

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,680
if you'd like grant i can unmute you if

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,680
you want to raise your uh say something

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,400
somebody asked me how i got started with

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,359
openstreetmap projects so granted so

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,359
grant said need to go ahead

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,560
oh sorry i didn't have a i didn't have a

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,920
question

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,400
you're just giving me a high five i'd

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,520
like that um

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,480
oh that was from before i i guess i i

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,000
thought it would just like lower

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,680
automatically

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,800
oh yep sorry we just just now saw it

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,480
okay um so i got involved i was a gis

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,440
consultant for many years

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,960
um actually mapping for an environmental

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,960
company using

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,640
azure products and i quit my job to

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,359
start teaching people

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,640
how to use maps um and i learned about

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,720
open source

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,800
so i really started with qgis and the

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,760
open source geospatial community

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,359
before finding openstreetmap um and i

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,640
got into openstreetmap through teachos

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,920
i'm actually i was teaching

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,800
students how to make maps and qgis and

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,320
using openstreetmap data

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,680
and you know workshops with

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,079
professionals as well so i came in

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,720
through

00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,400
more of the educational angle um and

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,760
then i sat on the open stream fus board

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,240
for a couple of years before

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,040
becoming executive director it's pretty

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,079
organic

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,560
path but it started with uh

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,560
gis

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,480
cool thanks for asking that

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,920
someone had mentioned that mapwith.ai

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,599
are you familiar with that is that one

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,040
of the tools you're mentioning

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,560
yes so matt with matt with the i

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,520
actually someone will be giving an

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,880
update about that

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,720
um like i said we're having our

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,599
conference next weekend at connect so

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,680
there's um

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,119
an initiative map of ai but the editor

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,040
that i was talking about is

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,880
is the rapid editor and i dropped that

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,359
in the chat the link to that

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,599
it's definitely connected okay

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,079
and we got about five minutes left uh

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,079
let's see

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,200
does anybody have any other questions

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,720
uh did you want to give a plug for your

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,520
event next weekend

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,960
sure and there's a costume contest well

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,200
mainly from like the shoulders up

00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,359
because we're all in zoom but

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:05,040
hats masks um we have 27 speakers

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,640
um it's first time doing an online event

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,480
but we're hoping to create something

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,119
that we can do every year even once we

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,839
start

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:16,720
going back to seeing people in person

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:20,320
uh so friday we have four hours of talks

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:23,839
um and a panel and then saturday we have

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,280
um four blocks of workshops birds of a

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,839
feather session so if you're interested

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,079
in like open street map and government

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,560
or

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,000
the future of mapping with ai or there's

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,480
a couple of different places you can go

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,960
and

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,920
talk to other other folks and a few

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,800
mapathons so

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,280
there's a project called crowd to map

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
and

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,880
they're based in tanzania they'll be

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,760
having a mapathon to

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,680
they map to end female genital

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,839
mutilation in tanzania and throughout

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,880
africa so they're having a mapathon

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,680
the youth mappers group who is in charge

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,960
they have

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,800
youth map there's chapters at

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,839
universities all over the world

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,079
they'll be doing a mapathon

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,520
and a couple other folks teach osm will

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,200
have a session

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,280
so it's all free you can register

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,800

get people together and hanging out and

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,160
our virtual zoom rooms um so yeah thanks

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,839
that's

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:27,760
a nice hope to see you there

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,800
all right anybody any other questions or

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,240
comments that i want to share with

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,240
maggie before we close here

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,680
i did see someone likes to do artistic

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,359
things that yeah you mean you could put

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,599
open stream map on a pillowcase right

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,800
you could put it on your wall

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,440
do whatever you want with it which is

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,839
kind of a beauty

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,520
uh since you're talking about artistic

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,520
stuff that reminded me

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,800
you talked about pokemon edits uh

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,079
earlier how there was an

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,280
algorithm or something that was trying

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,880
to make sure people weren't cheating the

00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,000
system or something

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,920
what's that about i don't play pokemon

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,440
but apparently there's these nests and

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,839
that's where you find these creatures

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,200
and

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,240
they're often in like lakes or um

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,440
parks so i think this is my

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,280
understanding of what went down there

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,760
it's like people were drawing fake parks

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,800
and stuff to try to get a pokemon

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:23,200
nest to show up so um

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,000
yeah i think that's been taken care of

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,599
but uh

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,920
it was an interesting learning curve i

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,400
think for people to see how

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,839
a game would impact an open source data

00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,520
project

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,400
in that way i mean i think they also use

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,800
it for their harry potter game now too

00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,319
never played that one either though so

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,720
another question came in from david what

00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,480
are some

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,640
other of the most interesting things you

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,240
see people doing with openstreetmaps

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,319
data

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,839
gosh that's the fun thing of this right

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,280
i only shared through stories but

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,040
um right now there's there's a lot of

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,079
mapping around social justice and

00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:02,079
diversity and um mapping

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:05,599
we were started mapping um

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,800
oh my gosh sorry monuments that

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:12,640
uh were racist and in places like

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,440
uh squares and and uh infrastructure

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,040
that

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,319
could potentially be changed so people

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,920
creating maps in the communities to

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,440
bring to their local governments

00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,200
a lot of accessibility mapping like

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,920
mapping for routing

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,720
um for visually impaired or hearing

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,839
impaired folks

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,280
uh there's i mean then there's the

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,960
people who have the

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,839
the shops of like maybe i'll make you a

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,079
map of your

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,960
town for your wall or like on your

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,680
textiles

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,280
um yeah that's cool the number of we

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,800
have all of our talks actually on our

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,240
youtube channel from the last few years

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,280
of the state of the map us

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,000
conferences and if you scroll through

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,000
them

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,119
there's just so much so much people are

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,119
doing which is really great

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,359
okay there's another question do you

00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,240
provide the do you provide

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,720
the ability to drop pins or alter the

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,520
maps

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,560
with javascript so can you edit via api

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,560
i assume that's what they're saying

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,119
yeah you could also add notes and you

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,400
can you know if you want to meet someone

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,680
somewhere like you drop your pen and you

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,520
can send them that

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,160
i think that's what you're asking so can

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,680
you if i created my own tool

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,079
um for my company or whatever um

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,240
and uh i wanted that tool to connect to

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,920
open street maps data

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,640
um via api would i be able to send

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,400
edits uh over that link or would do you

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,960
still have to manually log in

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,079
in order to manually uh draw your

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,240
rectangles and everything draw your

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,119
polygons you would be able to send your

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,400
edits i mean that's what

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,720
your map larry and and maps.me and osm

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,599
and

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,040
they're all external editors um there's

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,400
vespucci there's

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
there's so many things that peak tools

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,839
that people have built to edit so

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,480
absolutely um you could hit that api

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,800
from

00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,400
from something that you will it just

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,000
have to there's an oauth

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,839
system you know you have to have your

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,240
username and

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,960
set all that up but yeah you don't need

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,319
to go into

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,319
openstreetmap.org to edit

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,079
got it great well thank you

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,599
