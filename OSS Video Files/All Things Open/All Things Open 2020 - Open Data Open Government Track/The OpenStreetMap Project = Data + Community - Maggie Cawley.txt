Abstract: As an advocate for OpenStreetMap, people often ask, “Hasn’t the world already been mapped?” But geospatial data in many parts of the world has historically been expensive or not available. Not anymore. OpenStreetMap and its committed mapping community have altered the geospatial data landscape by providing free, editable open data to people all over the world. This talk provides an overview of the OpenStreetMap project and a glimpse at the community behind it.
