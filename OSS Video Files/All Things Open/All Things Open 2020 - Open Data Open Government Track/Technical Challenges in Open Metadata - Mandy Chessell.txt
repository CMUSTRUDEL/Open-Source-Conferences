Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Open Data/Open Government Track

Abstract: I am one of the leaders in the open metadata and governance initiative. This is seeking to develop standards and a reference implementation through and open source project called ODPi Egeria. Egeria enables organizations to manage data as an asset even when they use tools and platforms from multiple vendors. This type of problem is extremely complex and it needs the collaboration of multiple organizations to make it happen. In this talk I will go through the technical challenges we face and how they are being overcome.

thank you so much

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,719
and and also i i really appreciate uh

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,719
the opportunity to present at this

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,160
conference so i've heard about it

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,800
so many years and i thought oh this

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,080
would be this will be a super um

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,560
conference to be involved in uh so

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,880
the the title of this this talk is

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,800
technical challenges and open metadata

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,840
and open metadata is a project that i've

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,160
been working on for probably about four

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,920
years

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:38,800
in an attempt to create an ecosystem

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,840
where metadata that is information about

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,719
data sets and the i.t systems around

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,719
them and how

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,680
how the data is being processed what it

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,680
means how it should be used

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,079
um um you know this so so this this idea

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,440
of

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,079
this descriptive knowledge um is uh

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,039
is managed and uh the way we are where

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
we are at the moment

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,960
is that we have a huge number of

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,000
extremely good metadata standards but

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,119
each covers

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,799
a very specific aspect of

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,759
the bigger picture we also have

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,240
tools that different vendors have built

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,680
or

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,720
different open source projects have

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,920
built and they themselves have

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,400
metadata capability within them but

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
it's a sort of private store of

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,079
knowledge

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,000
and so this particular project was about

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,520
well can we create

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,320
an open platform an exchange

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,600
mechanism to allow knowledge from

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,920
different tools and

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,399
knowledge used by different types of

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,200
professionals across an organization

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,159
can we get that metadata flowing so that

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,399
as

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,000
people build on each other's knowledge

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,799
that knowledge base becomes more

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
valuable

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,200
and then is open up to additional use

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,759
cases

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,119
so that was the brief four years ago and

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,200
since then i've been working with

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,399
different companies

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,800
and lots and lots of different use cases

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,360
and we started an open source project

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,200
called odp algeria about

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,520
um just over two years ago um and

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,239
so today i'd like to share the results

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,760
of

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,959
uh what we've been doing um and go into

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,480
a number of the

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,000
the rather interesting technical

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
challenges we've had

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,800
along the way um in building software so

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
far

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,000
so let's just see if we can get

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,280
to page forward there we are so

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
why does this matter so you know i mean

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,440
there's so many

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,640
we've been through so much in the last

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,400
six months and for many organizations

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,280
they have had to

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,840
uh make some very quick decisions some

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,200
assessment and change the way they work

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,560
um to allow uh their employees to

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,040
operate safely

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,159
to maintain their commitments to their

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,800
customers

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,760
um and so it has been a time of rapid

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,519
change

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,800
and one of the things that helps that

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,959
rapid change

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,720
is to understand the resources that you

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,560
have and where they're located and what

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,640
they are capable of doing

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,599
so that you can you can you can make an

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,920
assessment

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,840
and redeploy them to change the way that

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,920
you work

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,080
now what's happened for many

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,120
organizations

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,120
they have a whole set of tools

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,040
organized around the current way that

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,000
they work and the current teams that

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,200
they have

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and those tools as i said have their own

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,040
knowledge base their own metadata locked

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,920
inside

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,400
a private database and that's fine when

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,040
the organization is continuing

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,239
to operate in the way it always has but

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,159
in times of change

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,439
these silos actually prevent the

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,480
organization

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,840
from understanding what's going on and

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,000
different parts of the organization may

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,200
get a different view of the situation

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,920
which can which can lead to delays and

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,480
mistakes so really what we're looking at

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
doing

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,319
is is not to sort of say well we need a

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,519
centralized metadata repository that

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,599
everything connects to

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,040
that's clearly never going to work we

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,400
need to allow

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,079
these tools to exchange knowledge with

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,479
high fidelity in an open way completely

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
open

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,639
completely fair and that was that was

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,280
the challenge that we picked up

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,360
so i thought it would be helpful to go

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,600
through a small example

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,440
just to give you an idea of what we're

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,400
trying to achieve

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,720
so for many organizations particularly

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
those in regulated industries

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
they find it very helpful to define the

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,560
terminology they use for business

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
it helps people who are new to the

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,560
organization it helps create

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,199
clarity in the way that people

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,199
communicate and it also helps to define

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,400
very clearly what types of data need to

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,919
be stored

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,240
and um and sort of how it's formed what

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,039
the rules are the regulations associated

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,080
with it

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,280
so this is often called a glossary or as

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,120
i called it here an encoded vocabulary

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,320
now this vocabulary is obviously in the

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,479
language of the business

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,479
so the business is also able to say well

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,800
this thing called credit card number

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,240
that's uh financial information and it's

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,400
personal information and

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,080
and it actually needs to be treated with

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,120
a lot of respect

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,479
because if we lose this information then

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,360
a lot of harm will come to the

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,160
individual

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,880
whose card number it is so the business

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,280
is able to

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,280
talk about the requirements for

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,919
management for governance

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,440
uh any special reporting or procedures

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,800
that need to happen around that data

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,840
because they're experts

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,199
both in their business and the um

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,560
and the regulations that govern it so um

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,240
there's you know they don't need to know

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,319
any i.t to actually

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
encode this vocabulary not just with the

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
meanings but also with all these extra

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,919
requirements and rules associated with

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,560
it

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,840
now let's start to think about building

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,199
systems

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,600
and uh typically uh when we're passing

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,960
data across apis or we're storing data

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,199
in databases

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,560
that data is structured and or the

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
description of how that data is

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,639
structured is is described in a schema

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,919
and for many um you know sort of in

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,000
for regulated industries often you see

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,840
these schemas being tagged with the

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,280
terms from the glossary

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,520
so effectively if you think about this

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,880
as a graph you've got the description of

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,520
all the fields

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,919
linked to what they mean which is the

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,759
the the terms in the in the vocabulary

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,880
and then those are linked to all the

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,960
requirements associated with it

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,960
so people can then look up when they're

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,479
looking at a database table for example

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,840
they can say oh i see

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,360
this field here uh um c number is

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,720
actually the credit card number

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,720
um because i can see from the definition

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,759
now if we it's nice that people can look

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,840
that up but what's

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,360
even more effective is if that

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,720
information is available to the

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,919
developers who are building

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,919
new function so um

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,160
i've been working with the company that

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,479
have taken the swagger tooling

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,240
and put a search box on it and the

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,599
developers type in

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,039
the name of the object that they want to

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,000
pass over their api

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,680
so say they want to have an api for um

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,479
retrieving a customer so they want to

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,360
return

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,960
the customer record um and so they type

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,599
customer in and then they get the json

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,800
payload

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,400
for that customer record um and they can

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,919
put it into their api

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,680
um and it saves them a lot of time they

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,360
haven't had to type it in and

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,639
it saves them rework more importantly

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,319
because they know they've got every

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,280
field that they need

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,919
and it's a standard format for everybody

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,440
who's working with customer data

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,960
the other thing that's very important is

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,520
that that schema

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,639
is also tagged with the terms from the

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,280
original glossary

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,800
so this knowledge has flown and it helps

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
the developer again they can look and

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,400
understand

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,680
the data that they're getting but the

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,680
value adds

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,360
when they then deploy it and push it

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,520
into the devops pipeline

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,560
because the devops pipeline can now use

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,039
those tags

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,520
to make decisions oh wait a minute this

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,080
api is passing personal information

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,080
it needs special protection it needs to

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,160
go into a particular

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,199
um secure gateway uh the database needs

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,519
to be encrypted

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,399
uh maybe extra tests need to be run to

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,479
make sure that

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,440
um the data is being properly managed

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,159
and and

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,959
and you know and cannot be damaged in

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,519
any way

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,200
so um the devops pipeline now is taking

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,480
advantage of this knowledge

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,920
um and uh and so we have

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,279
uh taken all that work that was done to

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,440
create the vocabulary

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,640
and really speeded up the process of

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,760
creating new

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,080
um digital services um

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,600
for you know from a um from a

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,360
development point of view so we

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,640
by by flowing that information through

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,040
the tools

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,680
we are adding the value and we're making

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,839
sure

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,320
that developers are more efficient but

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,440
also their work is far more accurate

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,040
when it comes to

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,000
meeting regulations now

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,360
time passes and that application has

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,640
been in production a while

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,880
and has been gathering some very

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,440
interesting data in its database

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,040
and uh there's there's a decision well

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,399
let's do some analytics on that data

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,360
let's try and understand our customers

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,440
better

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,160
um and so uh a data scientist is then

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,640
told about the database um and then

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,120
provisions it into their tool

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
now because of this process that

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,920
database

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,440
is tagged effectively with all the

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,399
knowledge from the um

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,560
from the original encoding vocabulary so

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,320
when that data is then copied into the

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,320
data science tool

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,920
two things happen the data scientist

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
knows exactly what data they're getting

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,040
in those fields because they can look

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,040
them up in the vocabulary

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,079
but also the process that provisions

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,720
data into

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,320
the data science tool may actually go

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,600
the data scientist does not need to know

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,600
the credit card number

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,519
of every one of our customers and so

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
that could be removed

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,320
or masked or maybe some things like date

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,279
of birth could be obscured in some way

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,640
so here we have yet another value that's

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,079
come from the fact

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,760
that we are bringing the metadata with

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,240
the data as it flows as it's redeployed

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,079
into different types of i.t artifacts

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,560
and then consumed by a new group of

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,160
people using a new group of tools

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,680
so this is the dream that we're trying

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,279
to achieve with

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,720
um with egyria and we've built this in

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,800
an open source

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,399
project it's something that's hosted in

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,519
od player which is part of the linux

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,560
foundation

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,440
so that it is an open fair environment

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,200
and that pro that that uh sort of theme

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,800
of openness and fairness

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,240
is something that we've built into the

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,040
platform as well

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,920
so that there is no central control

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
there is no

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,880
sort of single centralized database the

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,000
aim is that we make those blue arrows

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,600
as open and as fair as possible so

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,120
that as many tools as possible can

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,480
be a part of this ecosystem

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,800
so what are we trying to do to share

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,839
knowledge between people and processes

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,279
that use different tools and

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,720
technologies

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,600
and of course this is a major major

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,440
undertaking

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
when you think about how many tools and

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,079
technologies and different types of

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,079
people using

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:45,120
technology today and uh so this is

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,600
most certainly a multi-year project um

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,040
and will have a very profound change in

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,880
the industry

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,959
and part of its process is around

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,440
changing people's expectations about

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,320
better data management so if you think

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
um

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,079
you know 20 years ago when you bought a

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,600
laptop you didn't get security on it

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,839
today you would not buy a laptop if it

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,720
didn't have security on it you expect

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,800
that to be embedded our long-term dream

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
is that algeria is embedded in these

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,160
tools by default

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,160
and speaks open metadata by default

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,680
so that's our aim is that eventually no

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,760
one will even think about algeria

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,160
because it is a key part of

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,279
what everybody everybody expects in

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,880
every tool

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,639
another reason why it has to be open

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,680
source freely available

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,000
and also visible for people to inspect

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,639
as

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,200
we build it to make sure that it covers

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,200
their needs

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,839
and we do know

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
that many people see the value of this

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,320
integration

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,880
and have tried lots of different

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,839
techniques so we have taken that

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,600
experience

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:54,800
into account as we've filtered hearing

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,079
so um you know we we really

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,040
are looking to create a solution for the

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,000
industry

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,600
rather than for a particular a

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,800
particular technology

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,800
or um set of tools

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,680
and so as i said open source we work

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,360
very collaboratively with lots of

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,920
different organizations

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,720
and people who are planning to deploy

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,240
this stuff

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,279
you know they have their own rules they

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,519
definitely come from different

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,639
industries and that creates

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:33,120
um a you know that that helps us

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:36,320
um create the um the right level of

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,440
definitions for this environment this

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,279
fairness is so

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,360
important so this is a peer-to-peer

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,639
architecture no

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,639
no no no one product is in control even

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,880
nigeria is not in control

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,399
it is designed to be embedded into

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,000
different

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:57,199
different technologies um and it works

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,040
um as i say in a in a flat exchange

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,040
basically

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
the other thing that we realize is that

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,519
not everybody has

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,800
very large it departments and so

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,760
this needs to be as self-managing as

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,079
possible

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,240
it needs to have very clear diagnostics

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,279
it needs to be easy for people to set up

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,120
and use

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,199
so that it's useful not only in very

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,959
large enterprises but also in small

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,240
organizations where

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,199
you may have uh sort of technical people

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,120
doing research

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,560
doing you know using data in a very

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,000
sophisticated way

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,079
but they don't want to spend a lot of

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,279
time managing their infrastructure

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,399
around their tools

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,320
and so we need to make it easy to run it

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,279
also has to scale you think about modern

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,959
systems where

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,800
you know you've got stuff running out on

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,920
the edge you know with lots of sensors

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,760
right out in in the in in the furthest

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,839
reaches of the environment

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,160
we've got the omar mobile phones the

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,720
mobile phone is a data platform that's

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,639
uh

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,480
collecting data it's processing it's

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,120
making decisions it's just distributing

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,920
data

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,079
so it's important and also we have to

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,480
think about very large scale

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,480
um highly available global cloud

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,320
deployments as well so it has to be able

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,560
to handle all of these things

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,399
and part of that is what we what is is

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,600
multi-tenant support so

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,600
that we need to be able to support um

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,440
multiple organizations coming into the

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,440
same cloud service

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,680
but having their data partitioned within

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,800
it so there's no

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,440
cross-contamination of of knowledge

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,160
between different organizations

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
the other thing that we found was that

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,880
um

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,959
and i'll go into a bit more detail about

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,759
what this means in a little while but

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:43,759
um the siloing effect of the tools

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:47,040
actually limited visibility and a lot of

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,399
um security was enabled because people

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,320
logged on to different tools and so they

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,399
never saw the full picture

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,880
now we've brought it together we also

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,160
need to be able to reestablish

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,680
visibility rules and rights as to who is

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,720
allowed to update certain pieces of

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,560
metadata

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,639
particularly as we start to use that

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,759
metadata to govern and manage the

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,079
environment

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,040
um you know i mean the whole ecosystem

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,440
of tools

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,320
so we have to make sure that it's

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,600
trusted

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,759
and um the integrity is maintained

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,360
and finally it has to run everywhere so

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,759
we need to be able to customize it so

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,920
there is a connected framework that sits

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,360
in the technology and every piece of

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,839
external

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,839
dependency is managed through connectors

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,600
so achieving that as i say is not the

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
work of one organization it's not the

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,560
work of one team

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,320
it requires experience from a very wide

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,399
range of people

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,000
and so typically what we're doing is we

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,399
look at a challenge

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,120
and we bring in experts from lots of

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,320
different

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,639
um sort of organizations and also

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,399
people who are just interested because

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,399
their questions really help us think

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,720
through the problem because

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,199
we need to think differently from the

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,480
way that tools are traditionally built

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:10,319
and that um and so it's that

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,959
diversity um and openness that helps

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,839
us to do that and you'll see as we go

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,079
through

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,039
that um it has created some very

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,559
interesting results

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,240
and this is just a summary of the

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,760
achievements of two and a half years of

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
working in this

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,400
open space prior to this project i

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,240
hadn't worked in open source before

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,360
and i am deeply impressed about

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,400
how much speed and

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,200
the focus and the energy that people put

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,760
in

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,640
to just making this do the thing it

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,679
needs it's

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,360
it's uh it's actually been a very um

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,960
enriching experience

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,440
to work in in um

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,480
to work in this sort of phone to work in

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,720
this type of environment

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,520
um so let's start looking at the

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,760
technology

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,280
and go down a little bit into a little

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,039
bit more detail

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,080
and show you some of the innovations

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:11,200
that we have developed over the years

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,880
so this first picture is really showing

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,840
as a very stylized view

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,360
of exeria in operation and the first

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,799
thing you notice is that

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,720
the tools repository of metadata

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,240
hasn't gone away it's still there so

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,480
we're we're not asking

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,520
tools to be rewritten in order to usage

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,160
area

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,640
but what we do is we put in the

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,559
capability around that repository

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,880
to allow it to exchange and it might be

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,760
that it we are sort of sitting on the

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,720
outside doing an adapter type pattern

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,760
and doing the translation and all of the

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,160
distribution

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,440
uh logic ourselves or it might be our

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,600
libraries are inside

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,160
we've been embedded inside that product

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,320
to allow it to talk out natively through

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,640
um through our communication

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,559
um because and one of the reasons why

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,880
we've invested so much

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,160
in the actual logic of exchanging

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,520
information

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,320
is that um there are huge impedance

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,080
mismatches

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:15,120
in between the capability of each tool

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,880
as we as we connect it together

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:22,000
and it's our intention that every tool

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,120
can continue to offer operate at

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,120
its max its maximum capability and

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,320
algeria will take up the strain so we're

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,760
not about

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,760
bringing everything down to the lowest

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,000
common denominator we're trying to allow

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,000
every tool to be as good as it can be

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,679
and use the duria to fill in the gaps

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,640
wherever is needed

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,720
and so we've created a common language

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,720
and data structures to allow

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,960
people to express the metadata that

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,080
their tool supports

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,600
in using a common framework basically

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,200
because we we not only need to get the

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,039
bits and bytes across the network

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,760
but it has to be done with integrity so

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,919
if this piece description from this tool

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,679
is about a database column when it's

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,440
stored in this tool it still has to be

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,960
about a database column so

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,200
the uh sort of the um the semantics

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
of the metadata has to be preserved as

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,200
we move it between tools

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
even when they use different names for

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,240
the same thing

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,840
um and so we have we have um

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,360
around these data structures and things

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,480
we have the

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,720
um we have a set of apis

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,080
that are each designed for specific

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,320
types of technology

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,760
and this helps reduce the chance of

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,919
people putting different types of

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,480
metadata in in the wrong

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,120
place basically if you imagine this huge

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,600
um

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,799
area where data where metadata can be

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,960
described

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,280
and we want to make sure that there is

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,080
consistency in the way that the

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,400
the types and languages used within the

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,159
within the algeria ecosystem

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,360
and we also host all of the extra stuff

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,760
that's needed

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,720
around a particular tool in order for it

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,559
to communicate

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,480
so um and it's not just about um

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,799
you know sort of providing a sort of

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,559
runtime but it's about managing the

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,799
starting and stopping and configuring

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,600
and diagnostics and

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,679
sort of auditing of that exchange and

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,120
that's all handled in the algeria

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,760
around the home so

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,320
um so if you looked at it from a higher

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,360
level

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,000
uh sort of single chart picture then you

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,679
could say that

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,400
open metadata and governance that's

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,640
algeria as a sort of

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,600
descriptive name what you would see

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,640
is lots of different types of tools with

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,039
a connector

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,320
that is exchanging rare metadata in

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,760
their api

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,600
into algeria's api

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,520
and passing it into algeria and then

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,880
nigeria is responsible for

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,799
the distribution of that information so

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,559
you might for example have a data

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,080
platform that has a data that has a

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,120
database on it

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,679
that would that metadata would be shared

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,200
and then a bi tools or a reporting tool

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,480
business intelligence tool

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,960
would then pick that up and build a

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,080
report on it and that report then might

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,200
be shared

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,640
and then used by a governance tool

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,200
to display the status of something so

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,080
this is um sort of that this central

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,000
piece

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,919
is pushing and pulling metadata to each

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,919
of the tools according to their needs

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,320
um the nice thing about nice high-level

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,960
architecture pictures is

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,760
that it's easy to forget that the world

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,720
is incredibly diverse and distributed

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,360
so um if i put click on the next picture

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,480
this is

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,960
where algeria is in orange um algeria

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,799
is actually located in all of the places

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,600
and then communicates with itself and

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,799
that's how it does the the exchange

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,600
and um not only does it do the sort of

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,559
active live

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,000
exchange within an organization but

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,640
maybe where you've got two business

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
partners

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,400
exchanging data because

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,080
of algeria is known uses an open format

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000
for metadata it's also possible to

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,960
create an archive of metadata that

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,919
belongs

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,520
that accompanies the data um in the same

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,360
way that metadata from a digital

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,000
photograph accompanies the actual

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,200
photograph

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
itself so that that metadata which might

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,280
include

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,360
descriptions classifications terms and

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,799
conditions for the data's use

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,640
that can then be loaded into the

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,679
receiving organization's metadata

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,840
repository

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,840
and then used within that organization

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,880
here's another picture of the same

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,960
ecosystem to to give us um

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,840
a reference for actually going down into

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,080
the technology itself

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,039
so um in each of the environments so

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,880
there's the

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,320
sort of you imagine the different cloud

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,559
platforms and data centers are

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,200
represented by the green clouds

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,840
you put a platform a nigeria platform

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,000
and those are the blue

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,080
boxes um and those platforms

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,440
host the connectors to the different

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,200
technologies

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,039
um the connectors themselves run inside

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,760
a logical server and those are the

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,000
orange circles and we call those

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,799
for metadata and governance or omag

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,799
servers

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,080
so we have an oman server platform in

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,360
each location

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,240
with one to many omac servers sitting on

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,320
it

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,000
and the the servers themselves as i said

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,000
they host these connectors

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,440
and every single connective image area

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,919
whether it's a connector for the

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,360
the runtime or connector to connect to a

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,480
third-party

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,520
support is all using the same connected

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,480
framework

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,360
throughout algeria and this means that

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,279
the way

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,279
plug-ins are done is completely

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,000
consistent across

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,440
across the technology so you have to

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,960
learn one type of plug-in

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,559
mechanism um the other thing is that

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,559
these servers those little yellow

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,760
circles on the on the um

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,919
the cloud diagram are actually

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,400
there are different types of servers for

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,440
different types of integration

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,520
and in the center we have what is uh are

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,679
the metadata repositories so the tools

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,760
that themselves feel that their primary

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,679
purpose is to manage better data

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,200
so we have them communicating in that

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,080
peer to peer way

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,679
in what we call as a cohort so this is a

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,679
group of metadata servers that are

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,159
sharing metadata

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,679
and with that process we are now

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,679
creating

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:42,559
a sort of virtual metadata store

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,039
that is distributed amongst all those

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,640
cohort members as they're called

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,559
now that's great because we now have a

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,720
an enterprise view effectively at

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,159
metadata

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,880
but ideally we want to use it we want it

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,640
to

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,799
provide value and and help in

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,720
that sharing of knowledge and so that's

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,799
the role of the governance service

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,080
um and they are you could say that

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,559
they're a stop gap

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,840
for the time for now because

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,279
many technologies of course don't know

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,080
anything about algeria so they don't

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,600
call ligeria directly

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,440
so the governance service act as a

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,240
go-between they are

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,039
effectively pushing and pulling metadata

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,720
between

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,480
the third-party technology shown in

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,200
green and

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,559
the cohort so as they share metadata

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,559
with

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,799
the repository in there in the in there

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,400
that's in the cohort that repository

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,640
then shares it to the rest

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,440
and this is how we distribute the

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,080
metadata

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,039
across everybody who's connected so the

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,880
governance servers

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,520
give us that active and we call that

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,159
governance integrated governance because

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,360
it's it's actually actively using

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,559
metadata to

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,000
um to create uh um

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,559
control and management within the

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,480
organization and then finally we

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,159
we have to support people and people

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,440
need to see the metadata

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:12,480
use it and so we have view servers that

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,400
are responsible for supporting user

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,320
interfaces and they might be

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,039
called by a tool a third-party tool for

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,520
example

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:25,919
or it might be one of our interfaces

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,919
that are supported by edgeria itself

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,279
um and this is just another view of the

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,159
the different types of servers sort of

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,120
in a type

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,760
hierarchy to show to show uh what we

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,360
have

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,200
and i'll start talking a little bit

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,799
about um

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,559
you know sort of those different types

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,080
in a second but i thought first of all i

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,919
would sort of reiterate that the

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,559
platform itself that these servers run

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,679
on

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,799
is highly configurable and highly

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,000
scalable

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,960
in the way that it can support

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,320
very small scale deployments so around

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,279
the edge of the network

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,240
as well as multi-tenant environments

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,679
where you've got all the different

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,120
servers you might need

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:10,399
on a single platform or or using

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,159
highly available um configurations where

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,320
a single server is hosted on lots of

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,600
platforms so we can do rolling updates

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,240
or if one platform decides to park this

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,520
world

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,520
the server is still available

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,000
now let's start talking about how the

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,919
cohort works so

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,320
um many of the things i've talked about

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,919
that you know each piece has been

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,760
carefully thought through to fit in this

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,240
this border environment

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,919
and um and you know just building a

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,720
platform but there are lots of platforms

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,760
around

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,000
uh the cohort itself we have here is um

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,200
is in itself a quite a unique piece of

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,720
technology

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,360
because they're apart from a topic a

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,760
kafka topic in the center all of the

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,440
logic is controlled by the members and

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,200
so the members choose

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,480
when to connect and what to share and

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,440
what to receive

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,120
and they also maintain a list of all the

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,840
other members that they're communicating

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,279
with

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,200
in their own copies there's not a

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,840
central registry that's associated with

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,840
the cohort

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,640
and because organizations you know have

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,240
different parts to it

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,159
as well as sort of corporate type

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,240
organizations it's possible for a

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,919
particular repository to join

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:27,440
one to many cohorts and they will

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,120
basically see all metadata in

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,960
all of the cohorts that they connect to

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,960
so the chief data office here is seeing

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,159
both messages from both cohort a and

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,919
cohort b

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:41,919
in this process and we do this

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,720
um through a registration process

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,399
uh and so here i've got server one it

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,720
wants to join the cohort so it's

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,080
it's got this central topic and it's

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,360
called the rmrs topic

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,520
for um interesting reasons but basically

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,600
it puts a registration document

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,760
on to into the topic and just sits and

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,000
waits and when another server comes

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,559
along and puts its registration document

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,159
in

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,600
they then exchange registration

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,720
information and they're configuring

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,640
their own

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,080
um their own technology basically

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,559
um and so once that's exchanged uh they

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,080
each know each other's network address

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,159
and that means that they're able to call

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,320
one another so here we see so

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,640
the pink server server one issuing

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,600
request to server two so blue metadata

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,320
is appearing

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,880
in the in the pink tool and the blue

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,000
tool

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,360
is showing pink metadata um so that's

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,440
you know that's that's that's working

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,960
just from the registration process

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,120
but we also have um replication

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,399
happening in the background to allow

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:48,320
some metadata that's highly it's used um

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,600
a lot and is also um and it may be

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,440
um it is very slowly changing so it's

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,320
it's reasonable to copy it

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,200
um is automatically distributed behind

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,679
the scenes

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,320
so if server 2 goes away server one can

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,600
still see

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,080
key parts of the server 2 metadata so we

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,519
use

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,120
both federating queries and replication

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,840
behind the scenes

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,200
to allow a high quality of service in

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,919
terms of the availability of the

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,919
metadata

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:23,039
in sort of it between the repositories

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,360
that the algeria logic is maintaining

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,279
um a view of metadata that's like a

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,919
massive virtual graph

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,080
of nodes we call these entities

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,919
relationships between these nodes

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,000
and additional classifications which are

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,960
like extra information that a tool has

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,279
added

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,960
to the original description and we could

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,240
yes and so we call them classifications

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,159
and there can be properties different

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,080
types of properties associated with any

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,399
one of these things

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,960
and what we're doing behind the scenes

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,279
is we're shuffling stuff around

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,120
so here we've got the two servers we had

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,600
before so the pink server's got a

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,760
description of the database column

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,519
and the blue server has the description

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,480
of the glossary term so one of them

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,919
might be

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,919
um you know one and there might be a

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,559
column called um

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,240
c number and the other one is a glossary

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,960
term which says credit card number so

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,480
it's just

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,880
it's a description of what is a credit

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,519
card number now we want to associate

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,320
them

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,000
so we can do a number of things we can

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,559
take what we call a reference copy which

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,679
is

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,080
locked as read only into omag server one

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,840
and

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,200
so my server one can create that

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,440
relationship

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,919
um and that's great as long as oh my

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,000
server one um

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,440
is able to support both glossary terms

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,919
and meanings

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,440
um because you know basically we just

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,120
brought it all together

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,720
the fact that the reference copy is

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,279
there

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,919
is is is actually very important because

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,120
if

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,200
if a user for moment server one wants to

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,760
update that glossary term nigeria will

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,880
automatically root the upgrade update

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,880
to where it's what we call the home copy

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,080
which is the read write copy in my

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,399
server to

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,559
that update happens and then the results

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,000
go back and update the reference copy in

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,320
my server one

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,200
so we have a very strict rule as to who

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,320
is allowed to

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,440
update metadata

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,919
but it can be initiated from any of the

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,600
members of the of the cohort so the end

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,360
users are not really aware

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,880
that their local copy is a read-only

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,720
copy because

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,640
their updates can be re rebooted

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,320
okay so this is a situation where server

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,360
one supports glossary terms

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,760
and meaning relationships um

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,519
if they don't so these two tools support

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,519
metadata that needs to be linked but

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,720
neither of them support the other

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,039
then we can bring it into a third

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,320
repository maybe read only copies

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,760
because they're

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,600
the read writers in the original um

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,159
server and then we can establish the

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,799
meaning now it actually doesn't matter

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,120
which approach we use because when i

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,279
when a user asks for metadata

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,240
they will get the three objects

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,720
connected together

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,760
irrespective of exactly where they're

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,919
stored

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,560
and that's the piece that nigeria does

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,440
for the tools that are part of a part of

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,440
the ecosystem

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,280
the other thing that can happen is um

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,839
you might want to add governance and

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,760
your tool

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,839
might sort support governance so here

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,359
we've we've labeled this particular

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,240
glossary term as this is confidential

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,399
data

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,520
and that means that other tools that

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,240
extract that

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,240
definition can see that even though the

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,040
original tools didn't support it

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,119
so not only can we link things together

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,040
we can also augment it with our

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,560
classifications as well

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,639
and this is very important where you've

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,639
got regulations and things that

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,679
come after the tools have been bought

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,079
and they need to

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,119
we and and the metadata needs to be

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,480
augmented

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,200
with the new requirements from the

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,200
regulation

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,599
so that was the technology um the

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,760
the next thing to think about is what

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,200
type of metadata have we covered

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,960
and as i said before there are a lot of

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,480
really good standards but they are

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,560
limited in scope

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,079
so there was a huge piece of work to go

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,839
through all the

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,320
the sort of popular standards of

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,000
metadata extract what they

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,400
describe um and then look for overlaps

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,240
and uh link these things together so

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,760
effectively we built a patchwork quilt

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,440
of standards

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,760
it means that we can then exchange

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,880
metadata with systems that are using the

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,320
standards

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,160
and also maybe pull metadata in from one

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,240
standard and push it out through another

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,839
so we're able to interchange not in as

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,480
much as they overlap

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,320
but we also fill in the gaps between the

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,119
standards because the standards are

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,000
designed for very specific purposes and

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,119
the result is

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,400
500 about 500 types

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,040
of metadata linked together

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,520
in a model that is part of the eugeria

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,520
project

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,079
and we also i know and i mentioned about

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,560
these specialized services so we call

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,880
these

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,400
the the sort of the piece that does all

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,480
the exchange in the cohort it's called

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,680
the repository services

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,160
and that works with entities

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,040
relationships and classifications um

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,800
but that's quite hard for um application

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,440
developers who are integrating a tool to

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,200
use

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,560
so there are access services that talk

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,839
about glossary terms and database

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,599
columns and things like that and things

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,440
that they would recognize

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,280
and so we have access services that

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,200
focus on each of the different types of

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,160
tools we support at the moment

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,480
and i expect that that list will grow as

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,599
we focus on increasing the

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,320
broader range of use cases and start to

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,880
identify

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,839
new interfaces that are needed to help

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,839
with this integration

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,400
um so what else have we got we've got

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,079
uh i thought i've talked about this

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,880
governance service so push push

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,240
and pull the metadata and this is

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,240
showing the different patterns

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:05,119
of connectors that we support

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,079
and here we've got an example of that

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,119
being used

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,520
to extract information about data sets

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,200
data stores databases files and things

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,240
like that from the file system

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,119
and using those to automatically update

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,680
um a data virtualization so a sort of

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,119
data

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,119
federation or view system so that

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,480
there's sort of a single access point to

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,720
access the data

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,680
that then pushes through to the original

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,040
pieces so

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,440
we're showing here automatic exchange

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,200
and or distribution of metadata use

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,240
and being used to then reconfigure

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,880
another technology

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,000
um another area i talked about the fact

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,560
that we needed

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,880
to reduce the visibility but restrict

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,160
the visibility of metadata to different

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,800
groups of people

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,520
and so the governance zones are logical

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,480
groupings

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,960
of different types of assets and they

00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,680
can

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,520
an asset can be members of different

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,440
zones

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,040
simultaneously so you could sort of

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,359
organize your zones on different

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:12,400
uh different principles um and

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,880
and then we can use um

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,400
these zones to attach different types of

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,440
rules to

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,599
um the uh to

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,680
to the zones themselves which will then

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,800
control how the assets within

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,640
the zones can be used and then attach

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,079
the zones to different apis

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,119
to say only assets from this

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,320
api can uh sorry from this zone can come

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,599
through this api

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,160
so you can reduce the visibility

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,839
to different tools to different users

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,760
depending on how they connect into the

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:50,480
ecosystem

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,480
the other police is metadata security

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,480
within the server so there are various

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,320
places where we challenge a request

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,079
at the end the server boundary

00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,359
particular service particular operation

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,920
within the service

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,960
and then there's data centric security

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,160
as well so

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,520
each asset um there's an opportunity

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,920
for the securities security plug-in to

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,359
um say oh actually this is not allowed

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,680
to see this asset

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,599
or is not allowed to see this connection

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,000
so the connection may have passwords and

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,560
give

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,160
high privileged status to accessing a

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,599
particular

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,960
resource and so use of that connection

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,160
may be restricted to

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,520
certain types of users and so that

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,920
that challenge can happen and then of

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,040
course at every repository level we can

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,240
we can control what data is is what

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,800
metadata is shared

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,160
um i'm sort of sort of at the core core

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,440
level as well

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,640
and this allows an organization to

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,440
adjust how they restrict um

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,760
not just visibility as you read but also

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,079
who is allowed to update

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,480
and use for different purposes use use

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,359
um particular method pieces of metadata

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,240
for different purposes

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:06,000
um and finally something that is

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,480
extremely important when you're sharing

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,040
metadata is to know where it came from

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,839
and so every piece of metadata has a

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,280
header in it an

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,480
audit header that tells us um not only

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,680
its type and where

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,160
and who's i've been updating it and but

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,240
also where it came from and what

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,560
technology was involved

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,319
and that's not only is useful for this

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,319
sort of traceability but also it

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:33,359
controls who's allowed to access

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:36,720
who's able to update the metadata in the

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,720
in the broader ecosystem

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,079
uh another thing we talked about the

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,920
fact that this needs to be

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,200
self-configuring and easy to diagnose

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,520
anything going wrong

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,520
so it does have an audit log framework

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,720
that produces messages that are fully

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,119
externalized they can be translated

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,800
and uh they include a description of

00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,440
what what happened and what

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,920
the um the team running the server has

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,480
to do

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,920
to actually uh fix it and we can route

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,040
those to lots of different places

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,200
depending on

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:10,640
how the um organization manages their

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,640
um it operations

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,319
people um originally um nigeria was

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,079
going to be a back-end service

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,760
but we've had so many requests that

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,480
people want to see

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,599
what's going on inside and so this is an

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,119
example of

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,720
one of our user interfaces called the

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,560
repository explorer

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,480
that allows you to connect to nigeria

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,119
server and then explore the metadata

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,680
irrespective of where it's located

00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,040
as if it was all one big database um

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,200
there are other

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,599
explorers to look at the types that are

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,960
supported in a particular tool

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,480
or to actually understand how

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,960
all of the different servers are

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,720
connected to the different technologies

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,720
so that you can sort of get a

00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,880
topo logical view of the ecosystem

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,000
mindy it's a five minute notice thank

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,400
you very much thank you

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,920
nearly there um and so um

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,359
we've talked to lots of vendors about

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,800
this and and and we're seeing some

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,839
patterns emerging

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,599
so some of the um so

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,119
so some vendors have sort of two

00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,680
versions of a platform and you and an

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,079
old

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,839
and they they use algeria to synchronize

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,760
metadata from the old to the new to help

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,119
customers migrate

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,119
they might have different versions of

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,319
the product in in production

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,280
or various other means to get access to

00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,280
more

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,359
metadata or to use the open source to

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,520
get rid of some of the

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,040
maintenance costs they have in terms of

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,119
creating integration to different

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,640
technologies

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,280
um and so um the way we've been working

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,359
is

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,920
it's very modular and we've just been

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,599
building up the modules because we

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,880
um because we have um

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,119
we want to be very open there there are

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,079
some modules that are released and uh in

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,599
production

00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,680
and there are other other modules that

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,760
are sort of a skeleton of an api or

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,480
maybe just a design document associated

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,160
with it

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,079
so when you look at the modules you need

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,599
to make sure you're looking at something

00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,480
that's actually completed if you want to

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,920
run it

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,079
um but if you are interested then please

00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,440
collaborate with us and help us improve

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,800
any particular piece that

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,720
uh still needs work on it um and we've

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,640
started really at the bottom and our

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,480
technology is rising up so the green

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,440
means that it's it's sort of pretty much

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,720
finished

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,319
the orange means that there's work in

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,200
progress and the red means it's really a

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,280
design idea at this moment

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,560
um and this is roughly where we're going

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,680
we release every month

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,960
so it's a constantly changing picture um

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,000
and yeah so uh it's an extremely

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,119
exciting project

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,720
we uh have a lot of fun with it and uh

00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,079
we are certainly looking for more people

00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,359
to get involved so

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,440
if this looks interesting um please

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,599
please contact me contact the entire

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,079
team and we will be very

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,280
very welcome and thank you so much for

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,200
listening

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,359
i haven't seen any questions coming up

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:09,839
so that's why i kept going

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:09,839
but if there are any questions now

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:20,240
okay wow one's going twice

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,560
well i would like to thank our attendees

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,520
so

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,839
very much for being with us and uh thank

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:33,359
mandy for such a wonderful presentation

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:33,359
