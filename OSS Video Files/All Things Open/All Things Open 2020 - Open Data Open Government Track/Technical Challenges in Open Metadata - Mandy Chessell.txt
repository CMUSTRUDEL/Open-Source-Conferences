Abstract: I am one of the leaders in the open metadata and governance initiative. This is seeking to develop standards and a reference implementation through and open source project called ODPi Egeria. Egeria enables organizations to manage data as an asset even when they use tools and platforms from multiple vendors. This type of problem is extremely complex and it needs the collaboration of multiple organizations to make it happen. In this talk I will go through the technical challenges we face and how they are being overcome.
