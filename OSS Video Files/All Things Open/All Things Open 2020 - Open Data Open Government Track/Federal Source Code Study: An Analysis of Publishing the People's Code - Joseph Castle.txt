Abstract: The Code.gov team completed and published a three year study pertaining to the implementation of the Federal Source Code Policy. Findings show organizational characteristics of organizational cultural beliefs, public engagement practices, structural dimensions, and structural location aid or hinder agency ability to implement policy and technology. Results include implications for public administrators and open source practitioners alike and descriptive recommendations will be provided on how to interact with your government via code.

	00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,160
yeah so i'm going to talk today about

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,320
the federal source code study

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,920
um i'm i'm actually uh here in my

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,480
personal capacity i'm required to say

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,200
this

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,080
but uh yeah basically i'm from a large

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,199
federal agency

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,960
and um i've been uh been implementing

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,199
the federal source code policy

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,000
and uh focused on open source uh

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,920
software

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,599
publication for the federal government

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,199
so for the next like i said for the next

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,239
35 minutes i'll talk about

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,520
u.s government federal efforts with

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,160
source code and then open source

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,880
software this project originally started

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,680
as

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
as my phd dissertation at virginia tech

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,040
and

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,399
and then you know i kind of repurposed

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,360
some of it to make it a little less

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,000
academic

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,640
and uh used it for a work project but

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,640
ultimately

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
it's a it's a three-year study of source

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,120
code and the code.gov

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,039
program um and uh yeah

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,800
a labor of love for me and i i hope you

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,320
enjoy this and um

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,320
it's also published on github i have a

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
link at the end and i'll uh

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,159
you know you'll see that on the last

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,680
slide as well it's in our code gov repo

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,119
if you're familiar with code.gov

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,200
if not that's fine i'll show a link at

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,720
the end

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,720
so let me get into it here

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,560
so a little about me uh real quick i

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,920
won't do this too long but yeah like i

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,799
said i'm the open source researcher and

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,799
developer so

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,280
um you know mostly front-end engineering

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,520
these days uh html css javascript

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,360
a little bit of python for some python

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,000
scripts to do some data mining and

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,560
things

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,079
mostly with the github api as i'm

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,720
gathering metrics or

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,000
you know things for for this research

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,600
sixteen and a half years in the federal

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,439
government and various i.t roles from

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,280
engineering to policy

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,360
and everything in between worked in the

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,240
obama administration doing open data

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,439
policy

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,119
uh back in 2013 um had my phd from

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,159
virginia tech and i'm also an army

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,320
veteran

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,799
as well so let's dive into the

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,840
the uh policy real fast so to set some

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,560
context for

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,240
the study uh it all sort of starts with

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
the federal source code policy

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,319
so in 2016 the white house issued the

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,840
federal source code policy or m1621

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,480
we have different memos that come out of

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,400
omb and and basically a directed um

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,239
executive level agency so there's

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,879
there's 24 major executive

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,800
agencies or cabinet agencies if you will

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,680
so like state department justice

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,360
uh transportation and and so forth and

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
it basically the policy directed these

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
agencies to do three things

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,000
uh develop a an internal source code

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,599
policy so their own agency source code

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
policy

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,640
update acquisition language to capture

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,000
new custom code

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,319
whether whether it's built by a

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,360
contractor or a federal employee

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,840
and then inventory agency custom code to

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,959
be posted publicly on code.gov

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,360
code.gov itself the policy establishes

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,280
code.gov as a program office but also a

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,599
website and then we have an api as well

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,680
that

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,640
that aggregates these these inventory

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,159
files uh

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,159
for for placement on the site

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
so before um you know getting to the

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,519
study itself so we have the federal

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,720
source code policy

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,519
and um the policy comes out and we can

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,599
go to

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,360
uh github uh there's a lot of data on

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,239
the github api so it kind of makes it

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
easy for us to

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,800
to start there there's a lot of code

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,599
repos on github so it kind of makes

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,680
sense

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,400
um here are some github numbers this is

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,840
a table of data i pulled from november

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,680
of 2018 and you can see

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
the major agencies there's 24 of them

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,799
listed here and

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,319
i somewhat split them in thirds it's

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,200
kind of color coded um

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,720
you know eight in each each third and um

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,799
the idea is that the federal source code

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,560
policy comes out and you can see the

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,159
number of repositories of code before

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
the policy was published

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,400
which is the pre fscp and then the

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,680
number of code repositories after the

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,159
code was published

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
um and so it's interesting because in

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,959
some cases

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,720
um some agencies ended up publishing

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,680
more and some agencies published

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,000
less and so there was sort of this you

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
know

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,840
question of of uh you know how come

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,680
some agencies can publish open source

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,959
software or software in general

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,159
um you know it could still be

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,200
government-wide reviews or some other

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,080
things and some

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,519
agencies can't do it and if you think of

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,519
agencies you know federal government

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,840
agencies so the annual i.t budget

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,079
for the federal government is is uh

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,960
somewhere just south of about 80 billion

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,800
dollars

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,479
um this is just for it so hardware

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,240
software you know infrastructure

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,759
security all those good things

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,320
and um basically about seven percent

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
of that uh it budget that that 80

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,120
billion is spent

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,000
just on software itself software

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,840
purchasing and software customization

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,520
and all that good stuff so you know the

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,199
question comes comes to mind that if

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,120
everyone had the same

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,280
uh executive policy to publish source

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,400
code uh you know create the inventory do

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,720
the acquisition language

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,800
and publish source code then how come

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,320
some agencies were able to do it you

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,080
know conceivably everyone has a budget

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,080
everyone has i.t staff

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,440
but some agencies can do it better than

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,440
others and so

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,120
with the study you know to examine this

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,880
with the study the idea was well

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,720
there's got to be something sort of

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,720
bigger or something else going on within

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,280
the organization itself

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,560
uh that that you know it's not an i.t

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,120
thing it's not a skill thing

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,639
necessarily or or having people there

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,240
it's more or less something broader in

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,840
the organization and so that's where we

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,000
that's where i went with the study as

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,320
well

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
uh so that actually led to some research

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,199
questions so

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,479
i'll jump into that so the study purpose

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,160
was was basically

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,000
you know examine the federal source code

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,479
policy implementation by using

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,080
open source publication as one indicator

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,080
for compliance so

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,759
not the indian indicator for compliance

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,560
but that was an easy one to

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,320
uh to find uh to see if agencies were

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,680
publishing so specifically why do some

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,400
federal agencies publish

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,880
open source software and others do not

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,120
and

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,320
one way to examine uh the agency

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,160
progress was to look at the

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,720
organizational factors

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,960
um believed to affect oss publications

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,280
so open source software publication

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,479
and and and and i would argue that like

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,319
even though i was only looking at

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,400
federal agencies

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,360
the things that i was looking at and and

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,840
the results

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
potentially could you could almost say

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
like at any large

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,120
um you know any large organization

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,639
whether it's industry you know

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
non-profit or government it's probably

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,800
gonna

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,720
kind of experience some of these same

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,319
issues because uh these organizational

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
factors pretty much cut across

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,120
industries so it doesn't really matter

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,319
you can say one from an industry so

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,919
that's like a government thing and it's

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,080
like well not really because

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,360
you know organizations are organizations

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,199
and there's certain theoretical

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,199
constructs that go into

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,639
uh you know organization makeup and how

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,319
they operate and so

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,680
um you know specifically i was looking

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,440
at federal source code because that's

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,919
that's where i live in the federal space

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
and

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,960
that's where the data was coming from

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
but really we could we could take this

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,319
broader so anyway the um

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,160
the four factors were cultural beliefs

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,400
public engagement structural dimensions

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,440
and uh organization location and whether

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,360
these

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,520
uh you know how these affected you know

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,440
agency's abilities or or federal

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,960
organization abilities to to publish

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,720
open source software

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,360
hence comply with the federal source

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,199
code policy

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,639
so uh so i'm gonna dive into each one of

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,520
these real quick i won't

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,960
go to too too much into this but just to

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,000
give you some idea of what each one

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,560
means

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,319
or how i constructed the you know the

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,120
con or put it together the variable

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,400
itself so

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,880
cultural beliefs support making

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,400
predictions and selecting actions

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,080
beliefs are important to understanding

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,440
what is enacted given particular

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,440
situations

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
uh public engagement enables individuals

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,520
to come together within a technical

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,360
domain

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,639
to ask questions and solve particular

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,639
problems

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,759
typically public engagement is you would

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,840
you would be

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,440
you know having conversations having

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,280
meetings collaborating with individuals

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,960
outside of your particular

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,800
uh unit or office structural dimensions

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,240
include how organizations are socially

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
structured

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,360
and it considers centralization which is

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,599
decision making

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
uh formalization which are rules and

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,280
policies

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,639
uh differentiation um which is diversity

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,319
of skills for task management and

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,360
completion and then coordination or

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,879
communication so

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
a lot of words here but basically

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,520
structural dimension

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,720
is comprised of decision making rules

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,520
and policies

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,199
diversity of skills and coordination or

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,160
communication

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,080
and then organization structure usually

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,599
organizations will respond to

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,360
environmental disturbances

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,520
is what we call it and so what that

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,880
really means is that as new technologies

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,360
and as new policies

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,200
are created and the organization has to

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,279
implement those things

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,599
organizations will or offices or units

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,159
or

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,720
you know what have you will respond um

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,360
in

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
a particular way and so you know going

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,760
into

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,040
organization theory literature which i

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,560
won't really go into

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,320
uh basically they would say like you

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,080
know if if a certain

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,000
disturbance happens in a certain way

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
then the you'll you'll get a certain

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,519
sort of structuring

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,600
if you will i i won't go much more than

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,040
that um

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,120
organization location is not the

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,000
physical location um

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,360
rather it's the um it's it's where the

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,240
organization resides

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,880
in a larger like an organization chart

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,560
and

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,640
also has to do with hierarchy with how

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,279
many layers within that chart that unit

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,880
sits and also proximity to authority

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,959
and um and and i'll talk about the

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,720
impact of of these variables as we go or

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,720
these organization factors as we go

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,720
so research design it was a qualitative

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,120
study uh qualitative research

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
um typically qualitative research is is

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,240
to um

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,920
don't fully understand the phenomenon or

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
the issue at hand and so it's a way to

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,440
kind of explore in some sense

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
it allows for a certain amount of

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,760
richness so you know i did

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,920
interviews and collected artifacts which

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,200
were organizational charts and emails

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,399
and anything that would tell me kind of

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,360
about the the structure of the

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,560
organization and

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,040
and what was happening um uh different

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,839
policy documents and things like those

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,000
and um you know you started off with a

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,800
metadata analysis with the github api

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,279
so so to con to set up like a construct

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920
like

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,880
basically a conceptual framework um that

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,839
initial chart

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,839
to see where agencies were with

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,160
publishing open source software

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,040
so i looked at that first and then you

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,040
know div

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,120
more into the you know the qualitative

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,640
factors and then use a theory um it's

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,839
called grounded theory method for data

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,519
analysis and theory building so it

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,480
basically just gives me like a

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,720
like a prescriptive way to collect data

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,320
and then analyze it

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,800
i think that's it there so you can see

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,640
some

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,399
some general you know descriptive

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,720
statistics here

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,480
most of the units in the study were from

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,839
were from non-software

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,519
uh developing groups um which was

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,279
interesting because

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,760
you know i was thinking like open source

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,440
software uh the idea or creating any

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,800
software the idea is that you would get

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,399
you know all participants would be from

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,399
a software development shop within a

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,920
government organization and it actually

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,160
turned out that a lot of them

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,279
were not and so they ended up the other

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,519
types of

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,800
you know offices were like policy or

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,560
they were doing something else like data

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,399
science they were building scripts

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,720
which were software related scripts but

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,760
they weren't um actually

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,000
you know within a software office um

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,240
interesting the second one government

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
government units consume more oss than

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,720
they published

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,560
so since world war ii um this is sort of

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,959
ebbed and flowed with technology and the

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,160
resurgence in 1990s with like

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,279
server and web technologies um so

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,120
and i think we could probably say this

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,519
for industry too so that second table

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,079
where

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,440
we have consuming at 52 and publishing

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,800
percent at 24.

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
it just shows that there's definitely

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,680
way more consumption of open source

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,040
software than there is actually

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,640
publishing of it

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,079
and and i would say that probably cuts

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,079
across all industries as well

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,920
so data collection um you know i

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,959
collected based on the organizational

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
factors

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,560
and uh you know went out to the

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,440
interviews uh did the artifact

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,160
uh analysis collection and analysis and

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,560
um

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,600
for cultural beliefs um the categories

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
were developed and

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,079
it pretty much split in the way that

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
individuals believed or thought about

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,079
open source software and software

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,360
publication among like cautionary and

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,839
advantageous so it was almost like a

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,560
dichotomous variable if you will

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,000
but in reality in some cases people that

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,240
did have cautionary beliefs

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,240
also held advantageous beliefs so that

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,200
was sort of an interesting find so even

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,360
though

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,560
they um and i'll get to findings later

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,000
but even though they

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,360
uh were were suspicious of it right like

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,440
oh it's not part of my job it doesn't

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,279
align to my scope um i don't want to

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,800
change we're decoding a certain way why

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,040
should we code a different way

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,160
um it's risky those sorts of things but

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,240
then they would say well

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,519
but i guess it could be beneficial you

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,120
know for some people

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,279
um you know depending on what they're

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,040
working on and if that's part of their

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,399
you know the way they develop in public

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,519
software or if that's part of their

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,480
community you know if they're doing a

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
community or

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,639
you know their customer wants it or

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,720
something like that um

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
so basically cautionary participants um

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,079
in this category were reticent

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,760
with new technology and policy and then

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,680
advantageous from a definitional

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,120
standpoint participants in this category

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,399
held beliefs based on perceived and

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,360
realized outcomes

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,000
so oftentimes for advantageous if they

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,079
uh

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you know units or offices that worked

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,079
with software if they

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,600
had experience with open source software

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,959
so they were using something like a

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,720
github with open source software and

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,680
they were doing like ci cd and automated

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,600
testing

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,000
others they found that well one that

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,839
just solidified their beliefs with

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,519
using you know open source software

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,360
those sorts of tools

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,800
but also others within their agency or

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,160
other offices around that would come to

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,880
them and say hey what are you doing

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
that's pretty cool

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,720
can we try that too and then they would

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,959
get more people involved and then it was

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,920
it was you know this the beliefs would

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,600
start to change

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,680
if you will so if people can experience

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,399
it uh it often helps to

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,120
to change um beliefs you know and

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,480
expectations as well

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,199
uh public engagement um basically this

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,720
uh this is i talked about this a little

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,480
bit but um

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,959
the idea behind public engagement is

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,639
that you're working with individuals

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,480
outside of your office or outside of

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,279
your agency and potentially with the

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,040
public

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,600
and so you know organizations approach

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,560
collaboration basically with those

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,680
outside the boundaries of the

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,720
organization

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,680
public engagement came down to um

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,360
you know bi-directional communication um

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,040
events electronic tools and all that

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,040
stuff and so a lot of times

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,560
the participants would say i'd say you

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,880
know why do you why do you do this and

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,000
so

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,839
you know tell me who you talk with

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,360
outside of your office and why do you do

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,680
this and all this good stuff and

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
they would say oh you know it um you

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,240
know we would

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,079
create a forum we'd like leverage others

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,680
in some cases it would help to get

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,800
uh developers outside of their own

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,040
office to come and help and do

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,120
development and all that good stuff so

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,480
um you know there were multiple reasons

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,560
there and sometimes they would do like

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,600
team augmentation and even product

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,000
augmentation which helped to then push

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,760
them

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,120
to publish more software as well

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,120
structural dimensions i talked about

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,959
this a minute ago

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,560
there are numerous factors to

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,600
organizations structural dimensions

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,839
these are

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,639
socially constructed so how the

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,720
organization

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,639
comes about you know to make decisions

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,040
and understand capabilities and

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,040
you know have individuals with diverse

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,600
skills and what have you and so

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,880
structural dimensions um is based on the

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,079
literature called the technology

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
structure in literature

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,839
which i won't really go into but it

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,279
basically pertains to how units organize

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,279
based on technology technical

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,519
uncertainty or complexity

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,320
and so um you know i focused on these

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,839
four things

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,360
and and sort of offered the questions

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,839
and and responses and all that good

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,399
stuff

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,079
around the structural dimensions um

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,920
organization location was concerned

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,079
where the unit was in the larger

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,199
uh organization proximity to authority

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,959
so i talked about this

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:03,120
uh you know a couple seconds ago as well

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,120
so now the now the results um

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,399
so and and this might be some of this

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,600
may i

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,600
always think like i'm not really

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,360
surprised in some sense but at least now

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,759
we kind of know with some real data

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,959
uh you know how we've how we've come to

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,680
understand

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,120
you know or or how we come to realize

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,120
what's happening now or something

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,399
and uh so the idea with cultural beliefs

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,120
is that you can see

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,160
as agencies you know publish more

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,839
frequently

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,519
um for open source software they tend to

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,680
have more advantageous beliefs

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,040
so i think that goes back to like you

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,600
know they have experiences

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,360
they've they've lived it in some sense

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,360
right and so now they're

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,600
they um potentially will will publish

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,480
more but it just it just solidifies that

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,240
hey this is potentially a good thing um

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,079
it shows competency

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
and uh you know it's beneficial for

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,079
others and all that good stuff in a lot

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,320
of cases

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,519
individuals that worked in the in in got

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,160
what they all did but

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,560
of all the people a lot of them would

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,560
say

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,880
you know part of it it's our job right

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,040
like we we should be

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,000
uh publishing more software because it's

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,160
a public good

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,600
and it's taxpayer dollars and they paid

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,000
for it so they should have it

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,839
right it's the people's code and uh so

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,679
there so a lot of beliefs that were

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,400
advantageous tended to

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,640
um you know fall and fall in those you

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,799
know aspects if you will

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,480
um ultimately uh sometimes having

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,520
advantageous beliefs were not enough to

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,120
publish

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,039
so this was pretty interesting so that

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,919
was that sort of dichotomous variable

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,320
where

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,120
uh there were you know quite a few

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,360
people that had cautionary beliefs and

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,880
even if they thought it would be a good

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,960
thing to publish

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,200
um other organizational sort of

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,600
constraints wouldn't let them do it

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,280
um so you know you can think all day

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,640
like oh it'd be the greatest thing

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,320
uh but we're not allowed because we

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,360
don't have a policy or it's not within

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,280
our scope or

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,039
you know it's too risky you know putting

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,720
code out there and things like that so

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,160
even just having the belief wasn't

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,280
always enough to

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,760
uh to get you or allow you to to publish

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,919
code

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,880
so for public engagement um most

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,799
participants

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,480
coded in this category although although

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,840
those publishing more open source

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,559
software tend to be more

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,960
varied uh public engagement so probably

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,960
not

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,880
that surprising here either the way that

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,799
um you know a lot of times

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
uh we get out of our own environments we

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,200
get out of our silos and

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,880
we uh tend to tend to be able to you

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,799
know we learn from others right we go to

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,520
conferences like these and we

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,600
we you know have small work groups or

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,799
you know coding groups or hackathons or

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
what have you and so it kind of makes

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,360
sense that

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,120
as you're exposed to more things your

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,600
belief structure changes

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,120
um you know so then as you do more

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,559
public engagement and you work with

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
others you see what they're doing then

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,480
you

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,080
you know you learn from that and then

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,960
you're you know you're more willing to

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,440
do things or

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,360
or have an ability or capability to you

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,360
know to go on new things so

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,280
um it wasn't purely that it was just

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,000
more public engagement it also had to do

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,640
with like

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,919
a varied approach and tools so the tools

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,280
had to be in place and these were more

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,600
like collaboration tools

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,720
um you know a lot of times it came down

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,400
to

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
can you actually communicate with

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,360
individuals outside of your own

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,880
organization

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,400
outside of your silo so that could be as

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,720
simple as like

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,320
you know having an account on github and

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,919
and uh you know communicating through

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,200
issues and pull requests

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,120
um or it could be as um

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,240
you know i wouldn't say complex but it

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,840
could be something where it's a little

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,559
more rich where you

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,080
you know have you know slack and you're

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,559
in different groups and you can talk

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,200
across

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,000
organizational boundaries that helps a

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,440
lot too

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,480
so a decent amount of units actually

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,919
said that they were doing public

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,080
engagement but in reality they

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,360
they tended to do it was more like unit

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
testing and things and they were just

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,400
talking to individuals outside the

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,840
so there is there's definitely like a

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,039
nuance of like how

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,240
far do you go sort of metaphorically um

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:57,440
outside your unit to engage with others

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,760
and and learn from them as well

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,720
um the overlapping variables so this

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,520
kind of goes back to

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,440
um to the advantageous beliefs that that

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,240
even if you have advantageous beliefs it

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,799
doesn't necessarily

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
mean that you're gonna you're gonna be

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,360
able to publish

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,600
any more software or publish at all

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,440
really and so um there were some other

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,960
factors that were sort of falling into

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,960
place here that it's not just good

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,039
enough to have advantageous beliefs

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,240
but it's also that you have other things

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,080
in place so it's

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,520
you know there was some connection and i

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,280
can't you know being qualitative

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,440
research i can't speak to the

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,200
the strength of connection um or the

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,919
strength of correlation or correlation

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,000
at all

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,640
um with any of these uh sort of

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,919
variables but the idea is that

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,919
looking at the data and trying to

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,080
quantify it in some way

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,080
uh the four variables the advantageous

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,679
cultural beliefs the more varied public

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,520
engagement diverse skills and

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,159
participatory decision making all seemed

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,679
to sort of overlap in some way

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,640
so they were complementary of each other

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,000
and this would actually be an

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,960
interesting place too

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,400
to do further research um i i probably

00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,360
won't do it but if you do it let me know

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,520
so i can

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,480
so i can see what you come up with but

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,679
yeah

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,840
there's definitely more research to be

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,760
done here

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,280
um the structural dimensions so one of

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,679
the interesting finds here actually

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,640
there were two of them in this area and

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,320
um

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,799
yeah there were two of them in this area

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,600
and one of them had to do with

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,400
formalization so formalization is rules

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,480
and policies

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,320
you know standard operating procedures

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,159
uh sort of any sort of

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,360
boundary or constraint within the

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,200
organization

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,799
um some sometimes and this is the

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,000
interesting find sometimes they actually

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,760
allow you to

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,280
uh to do things that maybe you can't

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,520
normally do so um

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,960
so what i found with formalization that

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,960
was different than what the literature

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,640
was saying was basically that

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,200
um units would publish software

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,400
if if they had a policy in place and

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,880
units that didn't

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,559
publish software wouldn't because they

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,159
didn't have a policy in place

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,320
and so what i think is interesting about

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,600
this is that the units that were

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,039
publishing

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,840
when i talked to them they would say oh

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,159
well you know we have a policy

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,440
and um you know that allows us so the

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,200
first thing we did is when the federal

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,080
source code policy came out as we said

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,360
okay well

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,720
you know what are we going to do how are

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,240
we going to respond to this so they went

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,760
and wrote a policy first

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,360
and so i was thinking all along like oh

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,559
it's going to be the wild west like

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,760
you know people are just publishing

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,640
whatever they want whether they're

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,640
permission or not

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,840
um you know they can just go out and do

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,360
it and uh

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,159
and the reality was it was actually the

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,080
opposite they formalized first and then

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,960
they said okay well

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,320
now we can publish um you know now we

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,000
can publish software because we have

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,200
permission because the policy gives us

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,840
permission so

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,640
um that that part might be somewhat

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,159
governmental

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,159
um i think it's interesting we

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,000
definitely don't move without policy

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,440
um and part of it is that it provides

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,600
sort of the guard rails of

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,120
of what we can and can't do and and we

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,120
look for that um

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,240
you know it sounds like in most cases uh

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,840
you know for doing

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,280
for doing any activity and especially

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,640
publishing code so

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,799
uh that was an interesting find the

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,919
other part was um this has come up

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,600
recently in sort of popular

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,679
maybe probably just media in general

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,159
around the dc area um around

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,159
you know the executive branch and

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,760
there's other groups who do software

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,600
development that are government folks

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,400
um there's great there's offices like

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,840
18f and u.s digital service and and what

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,080
have you and so there's always this sort

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,520
of

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,200
in the press about like should the

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,159
government be

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
uh you know building software when you

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
know contractors

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,559
are out there who also build software

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
shouldn't the government just be

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,880
contracting

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,240
and not you know not uh you know not

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,559
building it themselves they should just

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,760
be

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,280
you know buying contractors and then

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,559
managing the process and what have you

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,120
so there's always sort of this argument

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,039
back and forth

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,559
why do we have these special groups and

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,919
what have you and actually what the what

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,360
the research showed is that there's

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,520
definitely

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,679
without a good uh grasp of the skill

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,799
of you know working with software

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,279
working with code

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,120
and being able to get it into a certain

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,880
you know condition to publish it if you

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,559
will or understanding what open source

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,240
is and how to actually publish or code

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,320
in a certain way

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,480
but we're going to be limited um as an

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,720
organization or as a government to

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,799
to implement policy implement any really

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,039
it you could almost just

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,640
generalize in some sense that you know

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,559
uh we're gonna have a hard time

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,640
implementing poli technology policy and

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,000
technology itself because we have a

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,000
skills gap

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,120
um you know across the government and

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,720
and i'll explain that a little bit

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,679
further there's this notion of the

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,120
hollow state

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,640
and if you um follow the in public

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,720
administration literature there's a

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,480
there's a group of of researchers that

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,960
basically say that the government has

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,600
contracted out so much that they've

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,360
become

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,960
um you know they basically in some sense

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,000
have lost control if you will

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,720
and so uh it's hard to manage it's hard

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
to

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,760
manage um and control

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,760
you know individuals or products or

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,520
whatever in delivering something

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,440
if if you don't truly understand what

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,799
that what that product is and what

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,679
should be delivered and all that good

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,760
stuff and so

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,360
the hollow state is basically that you

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,720
know the skill there's a there's a big

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,799
skills gap and it's it

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,159
and you know it's in government and

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,559
until we can get

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,760
more technical skills you know back in

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,840
government we're going to have a hard

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,679
time with any sort of tech policy or any

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,360
sort of technology in and of itself

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,520
so that was that was a pretty um

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,840
interesting find it's probably not that

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,200
probably not really like the most

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,799
exciting or new

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,799
information if you will but it's

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,640
definitely a you know something that we

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,600
need to consider as a government

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,400
um you know as we go forward and work

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,400
with technology

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,159
so organization location this didn't

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,039
really have as much to do with with

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,440
publication

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,720
um you know uh it was a pretty even

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,039
split among all these but

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,720
anecdotally it seemed like uh

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,799
individuals that were closer

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,159
so the the federal source code policies

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,679
aimed at the cio

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,360
and then the cio is responsible to

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,120
manage the internal policy for

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,440
foreign agencies so you know state

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,919
department or justice or whatever

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,039
and so um what was interesting here is

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,840
that individuals

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,200
and units um that were creating software

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,760
if they were

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,760
having regular conversations or you know

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,720
in touch with the cio shop but then also

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,720
in touch with

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,919
sort of an organizational customer or

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,880
someone at the boundary of the

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,360
organization

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,559
they tended to publish more software

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,120
more frequently

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,559
so there was a need to make it public

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,919
there was a need to work with an

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,440
external customer

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,200
and then there was also like a general

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,559
understanding of what the policy was and

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
how to implement it

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,720
um and that was somewhat anecdotal the

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,440
the numbers almost went

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,480
uh pretty even um you know in this

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,520
category so it wasn't

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,080
it wasn't as uh you know as strong of a

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,840
factor

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,120
the other the other part of this is

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,240
usually proximity

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,000
um to authority uh and uh so if your

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,000
office was relatively

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,960
flat or if the office was relatively

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,279
flat and less reporting structures

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,600
and ultimately there was usually someone

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,559
um usually in an executive position but

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,960
not always

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,200
but someone that could could grasp the

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,320
reason to do more open source software

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,000
um and publish more frequently than that

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,640
that unit that office tended to do it

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,640
more frequently

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,080
so real fast here i have about uh i have

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,679
about

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,799
uh maybe about two minutes or so and

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,159
then we'll go into questions really a

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,120
little bit longer but we'll go into

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,760
questions

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,360
um let me go into the theory so the idea

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,120
of grounded theory is that you

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,279
do a prescriptive data collection and

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,520
analysis piece and then you can

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,559
come up with some generalizations about

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,679
uh you know

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,120
at least what the data is telling you

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,440
for your studies so the idea is that

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,200
theory is descriptive it's explanatory

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,799
it enhances understanding of the world

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,159
and allows for predictions of what might

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,720
happen in the future

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,760
and so now now after taking all the data

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,760
looking at it

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,360
uh you know doing the analysis and the

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,799
in the findings we kind of get to this

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,480
sort of theory of

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,000
you know policy implementation so this

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,679
idea of this like descriptive and

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,799
explanatory

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,320
uh you know effort or focus of you know

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,679
policy implementation for

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,360
for um open source and i've pretty much

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,120
said most of this i haven't said it

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,360
necessarily in the same terms but you

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,559
know advantageous cultural beliefs help

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,320
uh i didn't say anything about

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,520
non-monolithic but basically working

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,840
within a unit

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,640
that has complementary uh beliefs as

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,919
maybe a parent

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,720
organization but also something you know

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,679
potentially

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,480
slightly different is okay public

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,520
engagement more

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,640
varied through bi-directional

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,760
communication so working with

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,120
individuals outside of

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,559
the organization hackathons

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,320
you know just work groups and things

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,120
like that electronic tools definitely

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,799
help

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,559
less centralization more formalization

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,399
so definitely rules the policy was the

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,159
big thing and the skills were a big

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,679
thing in structural dimensions

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,120
and then organization was a proximity to

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,720
authority and then having less

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,080
hierarchical layers so if you have this

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,320
sort of makeup or this

00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,840
you know gathering the data uh doing the

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
analysis putting this together this

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,640
theory

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,679
like you could almost say like i wonder

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,320
you know the next thing you would do

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,000
would be like

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,760
can i test this on something else can i

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,320
test it on education policy can i test

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,000
it on

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,320
transportation policy kind of you know

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,840
any sort of tech policy can i test this

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,159
and see if it would actually hold true

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,880
and you know in those other cases as

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,600
well

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,120
um for the for this data in this study

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,640
this is somewhat the theory of what was

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,480
happening

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,679
and so then you say okay well what can

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,799
we do with all that so there are

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,960
implications

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,640
so as as public administrators and and

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,039
really like i you know i talked earlier

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,120
about

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,080
um this could apply to industry as well

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,960
so you could say like

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,000
as engineering managers as you know uh

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,520
directors of

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,440
you know various groups that deal with

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,120
technology and and you know

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,200
it may not be policy per se but

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,039
technology you know requirements or

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,240
rules within your own organizations

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,320
these i i would imagine

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,399
these implications would would be pretty

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,399
relevant to you as well so

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,640
um units require policy to implement

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,320
technology that's pretty straightforward

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,399
even with policy it's not always clear

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,399
what can what units can do what's

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,240
required what's allowed

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,840
we have a lot of policy in government a

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,480
lot of rules in government basically and

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,960
so

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,559
there's sometimes competing interests um

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,240
within the units about what can and

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,600
can't be done so it's mis

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,760
it's almost like there's too much policy

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,760
in some sense um

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,520
public administrators should nurture

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,159
advantageous cultural beliefs

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,279
so the idea is that um you know we can

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,679
do more

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,200
if we experience certain things uh

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,520
public administrators should encourage

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,760
more

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,600
varied public engagement and then um

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,960
organization theory organizations you

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,240
know should consider how they structure

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,039
and some of that has to do with what's

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,039
happening in

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,919
in the environment as well and then also

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,840
how how units reside in the larger

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,960
uh structure in and of itself not always

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,880
it's easy to

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,760
to deal with that especially in very

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,039
large organizations

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,679
and that is actually it for me

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,120
we have plenty of time for questions and

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,679
so if you want to put them in the chat

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,720
or the q

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,399
a i'd be happy to happy to uh

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,399
to answer and i'll read them out loud

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,760
and then i can i can

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,760
you know talk about them as well

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,320
so let's see i'm looking at the chat

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,799
right now

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,799
um

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,519
so one uh so this is sean morrison i was

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,799
trying to figure out

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,159
i was doing some testing in early on so

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,000
i was trying to figure out where it was

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,320
so uh sean morrison um

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,440
asks uh how can we bring dod into

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,640
compliance

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,080
so that's a that's a broad question um

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,960
and i appreciate it um

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,399
so git is interesting dod is a very

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,320
large organization

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,720
um parts of dod do really well

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,559
um and i don't want to speak poorly of

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,080
of anyone in particular

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:47,120
uh the the best organization or or some

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,679
of the best actually there's a couple

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,399
the nsa which may say well it's not

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,399
really like

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,440
dod proper but if you think of the

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,640
pentagon but

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,679
nsa national security agency has

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,320
a lot of open source projects and they

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,559
um

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,840
a couple of them come to mind walk off

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,039
which is an automation

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,559
flow processing kind of solution uh

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,080
gidra which is like a reverse

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,399
engineering solution that one just came

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,399
out like a year or two ago

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,080
but anyway nsa has a website with all

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,080
their open source projects

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,360
and uh you can you can find that i mean

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
just run a google search you'll find

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,919
those

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,159
um air force is doing some really good

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,640
stuff in in various pockets

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,159
um various bases i should say i know up

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,279
by boston there's some good stuff going

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,360
on

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,399
there as well so it's just it just kind

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,360
of depends

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,120
and interesting dod in and of itself um

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,240
was one of the first to even discuss

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,320
open source

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,279
and federal source code more generally

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,480
with they

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,840
if you look up like dod q a um there's

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,720
an old document i want to say it's from

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,159
the 80s

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,799
so they they were talking about this a

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,159
long time ago they also had the defense

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,760
digital service which was out of the

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,799
pentagon under the office of secretary

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,080
of defense

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,200
and um and uh they they did some really

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,600
good work i don't

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,480
i i think that um some folks have have

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,240
since left there

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,080
just their time was up they were on term

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,159
appointments which means they had two to

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,919
four years to do some things and

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,600
and then they have a job no longer in

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,000
government um so

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,440
they um you know they're they've gone on

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,840
to do other things

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,519
and um you know i'm i'm guessing at some

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,919
point they'll they'll restaff

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,039
uh that office or do something else with

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,240
it but they were doing some really good

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,440
stuff they did um

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,279
we had code.gov they had uh code.nil

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,960
so there were some some projects over

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:35,360
there that the dod was putting out

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,039
um madeleine preston says i love the

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,039
shaving section on the website yes

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,720
that is one of the one of the ways to

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,519
get attention um

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,559
for agencies that aren't uh doing what

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,880
they should be doing

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,320
um that's a typical government um oh i

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,880
shouldn't say that what i'm generalizing

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,760
but

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,080
that's one way to get agencies to to uh

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,760
to focus on a particular policy is to

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,720
just make it public and then hopefully

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,799
there's some

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,559
some pressure if you will from from

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,600
inside in the the management itself but

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,279
also the public

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,039
nonprofit organizations and things like

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,559
that that want more information out for

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,399
the public

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,679
with the people's code so sean had

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,480
another one is someone that's been

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,720
working on

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,000
dod on oss for 20 years now oh that's

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,679
awesome sean

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
one consistent cultural issue is broad

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,240
devaluation and recurring

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,440
fud at the branch chiefly i'm not sure

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,040
what fud is

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,520
and when faced with numbers showing

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,280
robust acquisition cost savings

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,720
what can be done about cultural apathy

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,079
yeah that's a good question

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,159
um definitely open source software

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,280
publishing it is definitely a bottom-up

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,639
thing um

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,040
i also think as or what i've seen is

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,240
that

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,679
as larger organizations commercial

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,240
organizations have been buying

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,839
other organizations so i think you know

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,800
microsoft github

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,320
red hat ibm uh you know i think it just

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,240
shows the value of open source and those

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,800
are just two examples there's probably

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,520
many more at a smaller you know scale

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,240
level but

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,960
um yeah it's tough i mean part of it is

00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,760
that

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,079
affecting beliefs is is trying to show

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,000
it

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,760
through you're trying to show it through

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,960
or experience it or get people to

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,560
experience it so you have to actually

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,680
practice it in some way

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,599
and so it's it's small wins and then

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:23,119
proof over time you know

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,040
um george link what other metrics or

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,640
things do you look at that didn't make

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,440
it into the final report yeah

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,119
that's interesting so you know i went

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,040
into the organizational factors i was

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,520
doing a phd it kind of made sense

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,200
um you know uh getting into the

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,240
theoretical and the literature but

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,000
in reality a lot of times um and and you

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,520
know often on

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,119
um you know management now so you know

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,480
what's the value of this program are we

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,079
making our money on it you know because

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,280
we pay contractors there's a couple of

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,400
us we're not very big

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,680
uh there's four of us now but um

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,000
you know the question is always what's

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,599
the value and and part of the struggle

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,079
so we do show things like engagement

00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,760
metrics

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,119
where like you know we can you know we

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,400
have the number of repositories have

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,119
gone up to 7000

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,640
from 50 um and that's just what we have

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,920
on the site there's there's probably

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,920
more out there

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,280
um if you look at github metrics through

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,760
the api you can see

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,760
like you know number of repairs goes up

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:21,440
about it's about 200 a month

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:24,079
um are added to our site but then also

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,920
you know i think it's like 80 percent of

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,440
those are on github itself and i'm not

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,720
just endorsing github that just happens

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,280
to be where they are

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,119
um and then out of that you have pull

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,240
requests that are going up and you have

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,440
you know i mean it kind of makes sense

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,880
you have more revision more pull

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,400
requests more issues where so there's

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,320
definitely more engagement over time

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,520
but from an organizational factor

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,200
standpoint i just

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,800
i just looked at the ones that i had and

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,440
that was really just based on

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,440
the literature uh generally with

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,960
organization theory and then

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,119
also just with what we were kind of

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,440
seeing being on the project for a couple

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,440
years

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,599
william savino census is just now

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,119
finalizing our open source policy

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,400
still need to work on implementation

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,640
should we look at the open source

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,280
program office model a charter

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,440
any advice i'm not as familiar with the

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,320
open source program office model

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,920
um if there's something specific there i

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,920
mean i get the idea of having a program

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,760
office to manage that i haven't seen

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,720
that yet in government

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,119
it's usually an individual in a policy

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,760
shop

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,480
within a cio office that's responsible

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,200
which is

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,040
a pretty big task for you know some

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,800
agencies have billion dollar budgets

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,560
and which means they're just huge and

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,640
you're probably not going to be able to

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,800
to oversee everything is like a pmo

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,800
might um

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,480
but yeah definitely the the best way is

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,119
just get a policy just get something

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,400
published

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,079
because without that you're not going to

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,760
be able to do much of anything so that's

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,480
that's definitely number one

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,160
and then after that probably start

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,000
thinking about guidance and instruction

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,079
like how do you open source

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,280
um and not so much like how do you write

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,320
code to open source but some of the

00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,920
cultural things like how do you get

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,119
through legal what kind of licensing do

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,160
you do

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,640
all that good stuff

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,920
uh sean sean again uh thanks so much

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,480
appreciate it sean

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,839
uh fudd is fear uncertainty and doubt

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
yeah it's interesting so

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,040
um i know when i first talked about the

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,079
source code policy

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,480
in my agency um you know the security

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,320
folks were the ones that were the most

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,920
uh you know vocal and so as soon as

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,720
security comes in then everything else

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,359
kind of stops

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,960
and the reality is that if open source

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,760
is done right or the source code is done

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,720
right

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,599
um it's actually more secure in the long

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,599
run

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,040
um you know you have a dependency check

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,680
i mean we have like on our current

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,760
platform of 15 repositories we have

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,520
oh i don't know we have like five to

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,040
eight different testing suites

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,040
and so we have three alone just for

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,160
dependency checkers

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,520
you know snick github dependable

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,200
npm and uh and then we have all sorts of

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,160
other things but yeah i mean we have so

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,079
many tests

00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,000
and so much validation for security not

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,040
that things couldn't slip through but

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,440
it just makes it that much harder

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,440
um

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,200
let's see i think that's pretty much it

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,359
i still have a couple minutes

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,640
look at the ospo plus plus working group

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,760
for people

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,440
who are discussing how to implement the

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,200
open source programs office so that's it

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,320
thanks i appreciate that george

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,720
george ling put that on there

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,040
and then william followed on hold on

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,119
there's one q a

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,839
since this is now oh same thing okay

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,839
that was william

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:43,839
cool any other any other questions we

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,839
still have a couple minutes

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:54,320
i think we're it's quiet now

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,440
might get five minutes back feel free to

00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,720
feel free to reach out i do have our

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,720
government email address i'm happy to

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,960
give that out later as well

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,160
but hit me on the socials and uh and we

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,839
can go from there

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,359
and then oh and the study is live it's

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,880
the github link

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,520
oh you can't see it but it's in the code

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,960
gov repository we have 15 repositories

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,760
but there's one repository that rules

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,880
them all

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,920
and it's called go code hyphen

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,800
gov and so it's github

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,680
gsa code hyphen gov and within that

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,359
there's docs

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,280
and the studies in there as well so

00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,680
you're welcome to look at that we've

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,319
also

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,119
um we have a medium account for could

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,680
code.gov

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,839
and uh i've taken smaller sections of

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,880
the study and kind of rewritten some of

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,319
them to make them a little more

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,200
digestible as well so if you want to

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,359
look at that

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,480
we have seven of nine articles on medium

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,480
right now so if you just look up

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,920
code.gov on medium

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,960
and the federal source code study you'll

00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,960
see some of those articles

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,400
sean morrison the last question um maybe

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,599

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,599
dashboard the metrics on there

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,400

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,079
based on the inventories that we

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,040
