Abstract: Open source is an awesome space. Great place for learning and contributing back to the larger community effort. While this is great and all, there are times when we canâ€™t find the production grade tools we need. Artifactory is the premier artifact management tool which we offer an open source version and unlike other tools our open source code base is the same core code base as our commercial products! Now that we have the code where should we deploy it?
