00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,479
when i i was invited to uh

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,240
talk to you about the situation in latin

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,159
america i thought about

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,360
many things especially many things that

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,799
happened and that

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,720
are currently happening around this uh

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:49,200
so uh strange situation and this

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,079
situation uh derived from the kovite 19

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,360
pandemic which is being especially

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,600
violent

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,479
here in latin america many of the

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,320
countries

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:04,719
of our regions are in the top 10 of the

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,920
most impacted countries due to the

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,720
number of people dying every day for

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,080
this uh

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,280
terrible uh situation and and

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,560
i think most of the things we've been

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,000
thinking along

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,879
all these years around development and

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,800
the situation of our continent

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,879
are being brought to light to light

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,480
uh due to this situation um

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,319
i don't know how much you know latin

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,360
america but we can

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,720
start by saying that latin america

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,840
is the the most one

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,959
is the most unequal region in the world

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,160
many times when we think about poverty

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,640
and and and dramatic uh

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,680
situations around poverty we think about

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,440
africa

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,879
as uh as a continent especially affected

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,239
by poverty

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,080
but uh even while latin america is also

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,400
affected by poverty

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,239
uh the the main characteristic

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,560
characteristic that we have here in

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,400
latin america is inequality

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,599
uh for example just to give you an

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,720
example we have a

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,440
a huge poverty rate while we

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
have one of the billionaires of the

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,360
world

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,920
and the uh one of the most

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,920
richest guy in the world is from latin

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,200
america is from mexico and his name is

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,239
carlos estrin

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,440
who is always uh in the in one in the

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,799
first or the second

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,920
uh place uh considering the richest

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,319
people so

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,000
uh the main problem here in latin

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,120
america is inequality

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,640
it's not only poverty but considering

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,599
uh the development rates um

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
we have a huge inequality even within

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,360
countries

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,480
um i was telling jennifer a few minutes

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,519
ago that i am here in buenos aires

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,000
i don't know how many of you have been

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,560
here

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,680
or around here but buenos aires is one

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,360
of the richest

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,200
cities in in latin america um

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,360
but if you go to the north of the

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,439
country you will see population that is

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,959
uh living in extremely poor

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,919
poverty in extreme poverty just to

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,880
uh to let you know a few numbers of the

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,880
situation

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,720
regarding development and then i i would

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,479
try to go to the topic that

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,320
brings us here which is free software

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,639
and open access

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,759
but first i would like to give you some

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,759
context

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:41,040
um for example in argentina

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,400
in the last numbers are telling us that

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,880
40 around 40 percent of the population

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,919
is under the poverty line which is a big

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,080
number

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,800
and there is a another very dramatic

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,479
number

00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,400
which is which shows us uh that

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:05,199
in argentina 55

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:08,960
55 of kids under 15 years old

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:12,360
is under poverty line so our future

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,080
is uh compromised by poverty

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,680
55 of kids in argentina

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,440
under 15 years old is under poverty line

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,919
that means a lot in a country

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,039
which a difference from other countries

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,479
has

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,960
a cult on public education

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,199
argentina is one of the countries that

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,199
has

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,840
the hugest the the biggest um

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,960
public education system which includes

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,039
uh primary education secondary college

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,680
and universities uh which is a um

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,600
a big difference between argentina and

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
other countries in the region but even

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,680
while having this situation regarding

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,960
education we still have

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,160
a huge amounts of uh uh

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,360
poverty and people living under the

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,360
poverty line the context for the rest of

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,560
the region is not

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,680
not much better argentina is one

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,720
of the countries that has

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,639
in a best in a better record on

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,080
development measures together with

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,280
uruguay we are

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,800
in the in uh top 50 countries

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,039
uh in in considering human development

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,479
but we also have bolivia which had

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,680
elections last

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,120
last sunday and we also have brazil

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,880
which also has

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,440
uh big amounts of inequality with rich

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,720
cities like rio de janeiro but impacting

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,120
but the the pandemia impacting very hard

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,240
in the big cities like san pablo rio de

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,919
janeiro

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,440
and the north of brazil with big

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,720
poverty rates the same applies for

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,319
chile which is one of the more unequal

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,599
countries in the region

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,919
also it is a country which is uh now

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,280
dealing with a lot of protests and and

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,960
demonstrations in the streets so uh

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,080
latin american

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,720
citizens are mobilized and are in the

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,840
streets

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,520
and are dealing with the situation

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,120
uh regarding inequality um inequality is

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,319
the main characteristic

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,440
in in latin america

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,720

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,839
with the typical organizations of the

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,720
linux users groups as

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,720
many of users

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,000
may have heard before the typical linux

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,200
users groups

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,800
but our our founders uh thought

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,519
that uh to improve the situation of

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,600
free software and to accomplish the

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,440
mission of free software the the values

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,920
of free software

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
we needed to have public policies

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,680
regarding free software

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,360
especially the with the using with the

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,399
use of free software

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:51,839
um in the public sector uh

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,839
we've been very very um

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,120
we tried to

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,399
have a free software law uh

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,360
to make the public sector um to

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,200
to use a mandatory law to use a free

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,399
software in the public sector

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,480
why uh were we working on this in the

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,519
beginning of our our organization

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,200
because we thought

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,839
that many things uh regarding data

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
privacy yes 20 years ago we've been

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,560
talking about these

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,560
issues uh well together with the free

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,079
software foundation with aff with

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,160
computer professionals for social

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,959
responsibility and other old

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,279
older organizations like that we've been

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,560
worried about the use of data

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,640
in the state the autonomy

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,519
and the capacity and the creation of

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,720
capacity within the states

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,160
with being we sustain

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,160
that free software was an enabler

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,120
um for the capacity building within the

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,160
state

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,600
and in countries like argentina but

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,120
mostly in the region

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,640
the state has a huge role

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,240
in empowering innovation

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,760
and also in empowering

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,200
development we always thought

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,480
that the state had a role

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,320
uh in development and for that

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:26,000
having um public policies

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,480
uh supporting and using free software

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,800
was

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:35,120
a must within that agenda the

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,120
the development agenda um

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,519
so that was our first mission was to to

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,440
to have a public policy uh to support

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,920
the use of free software

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,040
within the state administration and

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,600
national level

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,639
and local level we we succeed with many

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,320
many

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,160
things for example in the province of

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,399
santa fe there is a law

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,519
that makes mandatory the use of free

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,480
software

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,600
or in in the public administration and

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,040
that

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,959
is very helpful uh to support a local

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,920
community of development

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,959
of support of services and many other

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,480
services and many

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:20,079
many other things um around

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,200
the the the use of free software

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,200
within the state but we also made focus

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,079
on another issue that we consider that

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,839
is a very very important thing

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,639
uh in a to deal with the development

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,680
goals

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:39,040
is that using free software in education

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,320
um we also had the idea of free software

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,519
in education as

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,120
one of the main instruments uh

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,480
to to develop uh capacities

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,839
to develop autonomy to develop the

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,040
all the the needs that we have

00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,079
to improve in order to have

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,519
um to improve our

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,880
development goals thinking about

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,200
uh free software and development is one

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,880
of the issues that i would like to post

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,639
in this in this conversation

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,399
that i would like to address in this

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,480
conversation

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,160
there is also another issue that i would

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,959
like to address in this conversation

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,240
with you

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,760
and has to do with the other uh

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,360
line of work we have in like in in

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,000
india liberty foundation that is also

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,959
one of the main issues that we have to

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,720
consider

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,639
in latin america is that all the

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,839
intellectual property laws

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:44,000
uh that we have in our region

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,360
after the wto approval of the trips

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,519
i don't know how familiar are you with

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,440
the international

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,800
regulations on intellectual property so

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,519
i'll uh

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,680
maybe i will be a little introductory uh

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,680
so we we have a common basis

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,199
uh after the approval of the trips

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,760
agreement the trade related

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,959
aspects of intellectual property within

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,800
the

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,240
world trade organization that was in the

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,560
middle of the 90s

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,199
1995 to be precise um

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,000
all of our countries uh all of our

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,519
countries

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,240
uh approved and and

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,800
signed the trips agreement and that made

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,240
us

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,440
assign a a commitment to

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,399
have um a common ground

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,560
on intellectual property laws this

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,800
common ground on intellectual property

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,199
laws made a an harmonization on this

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,639
regulation that impacted in a different

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,320
way

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,720
the developed countries and the

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,880
countries that are less developed

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,199
are in developing countries like

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,480
argentina brazil and other countries in

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,519
our region

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,800
um at the end of the

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,040
90s and the beginning of the 2000s uh

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,920
the debate on intellectual property

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,000
became

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,680
very important especially considering

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,600
the uh

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,320
the the coalition the collision between

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,160
human rights and intellectual property

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,560
and that brings me to something that is

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,600
uh

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,240
very very uh it's it's part of the

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,760
current

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,079
debate on wto and intellectual property

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,279
last week for example the trips council

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,800
had a meeting at the inter at the wto

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,800
that the trips council is the one

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,399
dealing with intellectual property

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,720
and they um couldn't agree

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,880
on a proposal for a waiver in

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,079
intellectual property regulations

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,240
um attending the kobe 19

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,519
pandemia necessities for for the

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,639
developing countries

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,120
so i think this debate is still

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,120
very necessary and it's still a key

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,959
debate that we have to focus

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,399
and many times the the free software

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,720
community

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,279
is not aware that free software is not

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,759
only a matter of technical issues

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,480
but it is also a matter of of public

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,040
policy

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,440
but it is mainly an a matter of

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,680
intellectual property

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,639
in fact uh let me let me tell you

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,959
something about

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,759
me and and and what i've done as a

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,920
professional

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,079
i started being a free software activist

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,199
i i'm i don't have um

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,880
a technical background i'm i have a mass

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,639
communication degree so i come from

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,600
humanity humanities

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,000
so i i'm i'm not very proficient with

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,399
the

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,560
technical stuff but i am i've been a

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,759
free software user since the last

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,320
20 years so uh i'm a free software

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,880
activist but i have to learn a lot of

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,759
things and new things for me uh because

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,680
of

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,320
uh not being a a technical profile

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,680
but i started i had my master's degree

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,920
in intellectual property

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,040
and i have been working the last 15

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,440
years on this intersection between

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,519
free software free access to knowledge

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,920
and intellectual property regulations

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,240
and that's where i usually focus

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,039
especially with the

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,919
regarding the issues of development and

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,439
human rights

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,600
which are totally totally

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,679
related we cannot think about

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,240
development without

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
considering human rights as part of this

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
development

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,120
this the right to have a of dignity

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,720
the right to have a good job the right

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,960
to have education the right to have

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,200
culture the right to have health

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,080
and all the things that the human rights

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,000
are already

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,960
said as said for us as to the basic

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
uh demands that a civil society we we

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,400
have to do

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,080
but going back to what i was telling you

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,080
about intellectual property

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,360
in latin america intellectual property

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,559
debate was a

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,480
huge debate for many years and it wasn't

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:57,760
uh posed on the public debate

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,360
uh seeing uh by the free software

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,280
community many times

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,240
especially in countries like brazil um

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,919
i have to say that one of the sad things

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,600
in our region is that we

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,880
cannot have uh state policy

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,360
you know it's like a we've

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,000
it is our region is a very convulsionate

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,400
one it's

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,200
not a very very stable our democracies

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,880
are not

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,280
so stable so um when a government starts

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,600
uh

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,120
debate and then comes another um

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,440
unblocks everything that's

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,960
that was wrong with that and i think a

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,679
big example on that

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,440
is brazil brazil is a a very very

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,799
interesting

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,600
interesting uh debate um uh

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,760
on intellectual property especially uh

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,200
during the lulada silva government

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,919
and then dilma rousseff government uh

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,760
when they proposed free software as

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,080
public uh policy

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,440
uh the free software community in brazil

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,640
was very strong

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,240
and they proposed two uh ways

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,480
of uh of uh debating things

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,679
one was a debate on the intellectual

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,280
property law

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,480
uh and um and the

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,039
the situation regarding the authors

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,960
rights

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:22,480
uh debate they had a a very open

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,039
a very wide debate on a new

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,679
intellectual property law for brazil

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,000
which was

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:32,960
excluded from the marcos evil which is

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,400
something like a constitution of rights

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,679
for brazilians which is in fact

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,039
one of the main goals that uh

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,200
the government of uh lula and dilma had

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,320
and it was a big success but they

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,160
couldn't make it

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,000
with the author's rights an intellectual

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,080
property law something like that

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,120
happened also in argentina

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,799
where we've been looking for

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,280
flexibilities to the intellectual

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,080
property law around

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,280
our country for many years with no

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,600
success at all

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,080
our intellectual property law is from

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,320
1933 and very strict we don't have

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,840
flexibilities for education we don't

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,320
have flexibilities

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,080
or limitations to authors rights and to

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,159
copyright for

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,440
libraries or for people with

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,640
disabilities

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,280
it's a very very strict law which makes

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,799
it

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:31,280
one of the most strict laws in the

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,559
in the region and that is also blocking

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,559
development

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,640
because of access to access to

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,640
educational materials i am also a

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,159
professor at the university of buenos

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,360
aires in the career of mass

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,799
communication

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,480
and we had our first semester

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,200
on remote classes and after our first

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,919
semester

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,159
uh ended uh we made a queue with a a

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,760
questionary with all our students

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,320
and 40 of our students said that they

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,400
didn't have access to printed materials

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,200
or books

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,200
that is 40 of our students at the

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,360
university of social sciences in

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,400
argentina and buenos aires

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,360
had no access to printed materials

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,760
and they they had the materials online

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,200
just because their professors like me

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,280
violated the law we committed crimes

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
to provide them with the

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:36,159
educational materials they needed um

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,080
for for having their courses in a

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,840
regular way in the

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,919
uh in in a in a normal or or something

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,840
between the emergency situation and

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,039
normal

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,760
and that shows that this kind of

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,520
regulation

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,440
is imposing limitations on how we impart

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,159
education in argentina the same is

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,440
happening

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,679
in all levels uh just this week uh

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,720
kids are going back to to schools in

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,000
argentina

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,200
uh some of them uh just a few of them

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,720
so most of the kids are taking uh are

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,480
having online classes and they

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,559
they depend completely on the

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,679
digitization of the materials and we

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,640
don't have any

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,720
uh flexibility on on the educational

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,039
materials within our law and we don't

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,960
have

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:30,400
any emergency um regulation that

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,240
helped us that liberates us from

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,840
committing crimes so free software is a

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:41,039
basic our state has no policy

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,200
on matter in fact we've been having

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,960
a lot of meetings with the government

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,559
with the ministry of education of

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,120
security and other

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,400
offices uh within the government and

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,440
they are using

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,559
uh property software for having

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,360
meetings uh that are

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,640
um with that that need uh that

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,200
compromise privacy

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,240
and that need a huge amount of security

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,400
and they are not

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,600
uh having the capacity to

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
deal with their own uh developments in

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,320
in

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
regarding technology so free software is

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,240
needed here in argentina

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,159
we have one strength and is something

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,600
that is really good that we have

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,520
as i already mentioned public

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,520
universities and

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,000
our public universities are very very

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,720
committed to free software most of them

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,679
and and they we have developers and we

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,919
have a lot of

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,880
a few a free software community that is

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,200
very active

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,240
so we have an opportunity there that we

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,440
could explore

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,480
in the future years i'm receiving a few

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,600
questions that i

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,960

to address them as well uh are there any

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,679

get in contact with the wikimedia

community with a wikimedia community is

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,919
one of the most active communities of

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,559
open access and free knowledge in the

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,080
region

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,159
together with the creative commons

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,120
community which is also very active in

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,240
the region

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,200
i i i'd like to say that um

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,120
even why the elders are the people from

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,480
the free software community

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,200
uh creative commons has a lot of

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,039
people very active here in the region

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,720
especially in uruguay here in argentina

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,880
i'm also a member of the

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,240
creative commons network here in

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,400
argentina there's always

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,200
also um people in chile

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,640
in brazil of course brazil is so big

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,960
that they have active

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,480
groups in all over the place and

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,360
especially because

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,200
they were very very strong during the

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,559
the

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,120
the the uh lula

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,919
until my organization they became very

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,440
very strong

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,960
very visible so they they became a

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,559
strong communities with a lot of

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,919
visibility and

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:44,559
impact in public policy but also there

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,880
indigenous languages uh there is also

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,159
groups

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,360
in in mexico uh

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,600
working with mesoamerican languages with

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,039
a

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,039
with the communities uh in in

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,640
the with the indigenous languages

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,200
indigenous communities

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,159
and they are also talking a lot and

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,440
having

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:14,720
uh interest conversations about uh

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,159
intellectual property and indigenous uh

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,480
communities which is

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,440
a big a big topic especially in

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,039
mesoamerica

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,080
in in mexico especially in mexico

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,159
uh there is a a lot of debate

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,399
on intellectual property and indigenous

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,840
peoples and

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:37,840
there is a lot of work in recovering and

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,960
saving the voices of indigenous peoples

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,840
here in in the region i recommend you

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,679
mauricio to

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,919
get in contact with the wikimedia

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,760
community um

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:52,159
which has a special projects working on

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,039
well there is a wikime a wikipedia in

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,320
quechua

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,440
in guarani uh also in mapudungu which is

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,559
the language of the

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,840
of the mapuches here in the patagonia

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,559
the the limit the the border between

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,840
chile

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,399
and argentina um there are there

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,399
or there's also wikipedia in aymara

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,720
which is one of the languages and

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,320
from bolivia from the pluri national

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,760
state of bolivia

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,799
uh so there is there is a

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,360
big development there well i don't know

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,799
how big

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:30,000
because you know there's a a big gap

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,799
between access to technologies and

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,760
the communities and i think one of the

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,840
main issues we

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,360
still have to address in latin america

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,799
is the digital

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,520
divide uh which still affects most of

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,480
the

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,520
population here in argentina i know in

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,480
all the region

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,840
i think i i would uh would also address

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,919
some issues regarding the

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,960
digital divide and some um

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,360
plans that we had in the region uh latin

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,000
america was one of the places where we

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:06,080
had these experiments of the one

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,120
one uh laptop per child uh that was so

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,640
uh um

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,240
so visible a few years ago

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,640
and i think in this situation of

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,159
pandemia where the kids are at home

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,720
taking classes from home this kind of

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,720
things are

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,799
an interesting resource but the only

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,279
country that

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,039
still has the one laptop laptop per

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,399
child uh project

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,000
and that made it exclusively with free

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,000
software is utilized

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,559
uruguay had this uh

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,159
this project that they call it say well

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,960
project i don't know if you are

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,000
aware of this uh project uh sabal

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,399
project was uh

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,399
the application of one laptop per child

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,240
uh in uruguay otherwise a country is a

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,679
small country uh

00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,960
with three million people uh which is uh

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,480
something like one one uh province in

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,919
argentina it's comparable to the

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,000
province of santa fe it's

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,080
it's a very small country so this kind

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,320
of uh public policy

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,799
are much uh easier to do

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,679
to implement that in than in countries

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,720
bigger

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,520
than uruguay like brazil or

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,960
argentina but we could say that uh

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,480
uruguay and the

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,919
um the ceval project was one of

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,240
the most interesting uh um

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,120
impulses of free software within the

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,799
region

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,679
um we also had here in argentina

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,559
uh different programs with the same aim

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,880
of

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,840
giving computers to students we have two

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,760
plans

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,440
one here in the city of buenos aires

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,039
with uh what was called

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,320
uh plan sarmiento which was providing

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,520
one computer

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,360
to each kid of public schools

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,360
the primary level

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,440
with a double boot with windows and

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,559
debian these computers had a debian

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,679
distribution

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:13,039
and they're also at the national level

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,880
we had uh a a um project

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,360
called connect uh it's connecting

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,320
equality that was uh that's uh

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,279
the translation for connectivide from

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,559
spanish to

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:30,000
english um um

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,679
connect equality which uh has this idea

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,880
of uh

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,320
providing equipment for for uh

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,760
students was one of the main

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,799
things for for gaining equality which is

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,159
uh as i said at the beginning

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,799
one of the main problems in a region

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,760
but this program connected well that was

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,320
a very active

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,440
they delivered millions millions of

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,799
computers

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,120
uh to students at a secondary level for

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,840
to all the country this uh this uh

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,640
program

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,440
impacted the whole country from north to

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,799
south

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,640
um these computers had

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,080
windows we were in a very very hard

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,960
debate of

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,720
well we said don't use windows but

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,240
microsoft had a very

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,799
influence policy and they provided very

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,559
very cheap

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,240
agreements with the government so they

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:32,240
had windows in the machines

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:35,840
but they had also a debian based

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,840
distribution uh called wida

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,519
and waida was a debian based

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,000
distribution that was

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,440
provided by the ministry of education

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,519
developed by the

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,519
ministry of education with a lot of

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,880
educational resources

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,080
and that was a very very interesting

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,480
initiative the

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,559
the the problem there was that

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,080
they delivered the machines they deliver

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,120
a lot of manuals a lot of

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,799
documentation uh they also deliver a lot

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:10,720
of information on free software

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:14,320
but the the problem was

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,320
that uh the most of the professor were

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,200
not committed to free software

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,399
and they opted uh for using windows

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,600
instead of the free

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,399
uh software distro in the machine so

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,279
that

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,960
had a different impact uh regarding the

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,360
penetration of resolver

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,480
it was a big opportunity that uh

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,600
suddenly

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,799
sadly it was uh suspended

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,519
when mauricio macri got to government uh

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,559
when he went with the mauricio macri

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,960
administration

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:50,000
he cut all the this kind of program so

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,919
he suspended in fact when he left the

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,480
government

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,720
the new ministry of education that come

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,600
came with a new government of alberto

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,799
fernandez

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,760
found a deposit with thousands of these

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,080
computers

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,760
new ones in the boxes that were not

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,520
delivered to the kids

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,079
during the the the former administration

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,280
the the good part was that those

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,280
computers that were

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,720
found in deposits of the ministry of

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,200
education uh

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,079
are being delivered now to the kids that

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,000
are

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:27,359
not connected during the pandemia um

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,159
but uh it's a very sad to find out that

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,280
this program that was a very interesting

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,760
opportunity

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:39,440
for educating and free software and to

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,720
to to address the digital divide uh

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,800
uh was abandoned that way uh

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,119
javier there is a question here are

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,119

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,079
you partnered outside of latin americas

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,919

of people in europe in asia in

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,599
the rest of latin america and in the us

in the us uh we've been working very

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,079
close to the free software foundation as

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,000
i already mentioned

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,000
we are very good friends of richard

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,040
stallman and all this uh the group

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,480
working with him together we are

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,680
also very good friends of the electronic

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,119
frontier foundation

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,520
we we cooperated with them many many

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,800
times we are also members

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,920
of um of the

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,320
the computer professionals for social

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,040
responsibilities

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,800
and we are also members of this uh of

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,480
this group but we also

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,240
uh partner with people in europe with

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,560
the university of maastricht

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,160

uh the most valuable thing uh we've been

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,400
witnessing in the

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,040
in the recent years and which programs

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,079
uh

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,200

well many things i um we have

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,200
a different lines of our work uh one of

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,000
our

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,119
lines is i think it deserves a whole

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,320
conversation

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,800
is electronic voting we've been

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,640
the champions against electronic voting

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,680
here in argentina and

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,000
we've been researching and public and

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,960
reporting vulnerabilities and

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,160
campaigning

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,920
and and talking about electronic voting

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,760
since 2003 when we had the first

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,200
experience of electronic voting here in

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,680
argentina in the

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,920
city of usually which i strongly

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,720
recommend you to visit is a paradise in

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,040
the south

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,400
it's a very beautiful city in the south

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,599
um

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,640
but in in when we started talking about

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,800
using electronic

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:50,240
voting all our members got got uh

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,880
panicked because of the vulnerabilities

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,960
and the

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,480
impacts on democracy that electronic

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,880
voting has so

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,599
we've been uh championing against that

00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,599
here

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,680
we've been the first ones talking about

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,079
that in the region and

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,720
now we are working together with other

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,720
countries

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,440
like chile colombia and paraguay

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,079
which have different projects of

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,119
implementing electronic voting

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,560
we already gave up in brazil

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,599
and venezuela which are

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:27,440
which have electronic voting deployed to

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,079
all their population and which we

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,880
consider that is so vulnerab or

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,440
vulnerable

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,480
and against the democratic values i

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,599
think this is uh

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,400
the the main thing which uh which we

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,320
we've been working and and open source

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,560
and free software has

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,839
something to say about that because we

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,960
are always

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,440
talking about uh make the the source

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,839
code

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,800
of the machines the voting machines

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,079
public

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,960
but that is uh necessary

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,040
but not enough to trust an electronic

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,760
votings as uh richard starman said in a

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,200
prologue of

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,760
uh one of our books uh we cannot trust

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,119
on computers for voting not not even the

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,079
free software computers

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,079
and that is one of the things most

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,400
valuable we've done we stopped

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,640
the implementation of electronic voting

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,920
here in in argentina and we are very

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,800
proud of that

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,000
and now one of the main things we are

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,359
dealing with is the issue

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,720
of public surveillance and our facial

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,960
recognition

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,720
and all the implementation of these uh

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,280
things that are impacting

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,480
on the in the democracy here in

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,160
argentina in fact

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,240
we've been before entering the

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,599
conference i've been talking with our

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,640
other colleagues here

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,480
uh because this week the city of buenos

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,599
aires will approve the use of facial

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,319
recognition

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,400
uh in the streets of uh buenos aires

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,960
which we consider is a

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,240
a very bad impact on democracy and civil

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,839
liberties here

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:02,480
um but we also are working yes

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,839
jennifer i'm sorry just yeah just

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,440
wanting to let you know you have about

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,520
five minutes left

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:12,640
yes yes i i um i don't know if there are

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,400
other questions or there's a lot of

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,319
things that i can tell you

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
about the region about the situation

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,760
here in argentina and in the rest of the

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,440
countries

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:26,480
let me tell you that just to to wrap up

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,960
we have a a strong free software

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,560
community in latin america

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,599
we've been working hard for having a

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,960
free software as

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,240
public policy we succeed in many issues

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,160
but we still have a lot uh to do uh

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,839
especially regarding intellectual

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,560
property regulations

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,079
um and i think uh these debates on

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,359
intellectual property

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:56,079
are one are very very important

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,800
because of the impact of the pandemia

00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,440
and

00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,440
the need for access to knowledge access

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,119
to educational materials

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,599
access to research and access to

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,720
knowledge

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,079
not only regarding patents but also

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,160
regarding copyright

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:17,599
on materials for

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,680
education and uh research uh

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,720
in the public system uh here in

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,720
argentina

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,240
uh and and also in the rest of the

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,520
region where i think

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,839
i know they are having similar debates

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,960
as

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,520
uh what we are having here in

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,240
in our region so um the free software

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,280
community is

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,480
very active and will keep pushing for

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,960
free software for a free society and

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,880
just to finish if you don't have any

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,160
other questions

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,040
i was very very happy to

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,880
to hear you and to share with you our

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,319
vision from latin america and this

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,839
international track of

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,839
all things open
