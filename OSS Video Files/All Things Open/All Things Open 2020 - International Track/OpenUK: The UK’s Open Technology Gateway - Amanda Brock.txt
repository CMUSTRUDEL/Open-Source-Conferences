Abstract: In this talk, Amanda Brock will take a close look at OpenUK, the UK’s industry and advocacy organisation for Open Technology. Amanda currently serves as the CEO.

Attendees should leave the talk with a much better understanding of open source and open technology in the UK, as well as how to get involved  and participate in multiple ways.

About OpenUK:

Led by Amanda Brock, CEO, with a pro bono Leadership team and a Board of experts from Open Technology who together bring together over a century of knowledge, OpenUK’s vision is to develop and sustain UK leadership in Open Technology, making open the norm in UK business and public life. With a focus on the UK it works collaboratively with individuals and organisations globally, as well as with all Open Technology communities. 

According to the group, the term “Open Technology” means the “3 Opens”- open source software, open hardware and open data, which Open UK believes combine for a bright future.

OpenUK is supported by a large number of volunteers working on projects and work streams across the 3 Pillars of OpenUK: Community, Legal and Policy and Learning.

It is funded by companies including Arm, Facebook, GitHub, Google, Huawei, Microsoft and RedHat with in kind and pro bono sponsorship from a number of local organisations.  It recently launched an individual Supporter model allowing it to move to its first elected Board in 2020.

Attend this session to learn more about OpenUK initiatives, such as OpenUK Week, its policy work, its kids programs and summer camp, as well as its academic certification program.

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,759
few minutes first just introducing you

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,280
to me i know it's a relatively small

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,759
group but i assume that these will be

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,320
shared

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,200
and the video probably watched later so

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,079
let me give you

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,880
a little bit of uh background on me

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,360
like many folk in open source i don't

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,880
have

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,360
one job so as well as being ceo open uk

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,960
i do a number of other things i am a

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,280
european representative

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,040
of open invention network the world's

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,200
biggest defensive patent pool which i'm

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,720
sure many of you have heard of

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:59,520
oin is now 13 years old it has

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,640
a community of over 3 200 licensees

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,640
over 2.5 million patents in the pool

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,759
and over 100 million of defensive

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,879
patents that it's

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,640
bought itself which are licensed out to

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,720
anybody who participates

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,640
and participating in oin is actually one

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
of the the key

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,800
aspects of good housekeeping that any

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,920
organization coming to open source will

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,239
take part in

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,040
is all the governance work that uh an

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,160
ospo

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,440
or team working on the open source um

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,959
processes will undertake in uh

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,519
making sure that your open source is

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,160
compliant and an aspect of that should

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,319
include joining oin which is zero cost

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,440
and which means that you will give a

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,280
license

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,120
and also receive that from the other

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
three thousand plus licensees in your

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,040
group

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,680
and the license is to your patents to

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,560
the extent

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,400
that they read on or applied to software

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,120
that's listed in a linux system

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,640
definition

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,480
a bit of a misnomer it's actually an

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,760
open source definition now i'm telling

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,959

with oin for about eight years now

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,879
because it matters to me

those are by some of the luminaries

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,320
across open source

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,440
people including mark radcliffe in

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
california

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,080
karen sandler in new york and then a

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,720
bunch of people across europe

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,720
pamchastic the people who are the

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,840
experts the leading experts on the

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,080
particular area

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,440
in law governance and policy and the

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
book is called free and open source

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,160
software law

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,520
policy and practice it's a second

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,759
edition

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,680
my particular chapter which i have

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
written as well as editing the book

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,199
relates to open source and business

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,520
models

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,880
very fashionable topic at the moment but

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,720
it's something that's been dear to my

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,400
heart for a decade

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,840
and i'll talk to you a little bit more

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,520
about canonical in a moment but my

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,639
experience in canonical put me on the

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
coal face

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,960
as far as business models were concerned

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,600
during the transition that we saw

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,800
from a more traditional model to a

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,880
platform economy and

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,400
for me i had to completely rewrite my

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,840
chapter because of course business

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,600
models have moved on

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:39,039
so so much since the first edition was

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:41,039
published seven years ago

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,960
and that book is something actually that

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,240
i'm very very proud of

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,880
we are going to publish it open access

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,720
and the open access is possible thanks

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,560
to the beach foundation

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
so the book will be published by oxford

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,840
university press

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,000
but it's a law textbook and it's going

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,560
to be a very hefty law textbook

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,680
and obviously not cheap but it will be

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,360
completely free

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,360
and available as a pdf and an e-reader

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,520
through the beach foundation sponsorship

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,639
so it's all very exciting

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,639
um and then i guess one of my roles is

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,160
this kind of thing i spent a lot of my

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,280
life talking to people all over the

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,759
world

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,160
in another lifetime that involved me

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,639
having 20 conference trips planned

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
this year booked and paid for back in

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,039
january

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,800
and the only one of those sadly that

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,080
i've been able to meet to make

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,280
is fosdem in brussels back in

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,800
january february um so these days i

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,479
spend a lot of my life

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,199
on zoom calls like this talking to

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,039
myself and usually today you are not

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,240
having a special guest appearance from

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,479
dundee my

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,639
marmalade kitten who likes to climb over

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,400
the keyboard mid-flow

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,759
because of course i'm in an office in

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,319
central london

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,720
um but i do a lot of this kind of

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,880
talking and i absolutely love the all

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
things open posters this is me with last

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,199
year's one

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,639
which has been my uh my uh i suppose

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,000
headshot for the last year you'd be

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,520
surprised by how many people have been

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,120
willing to let me have my whole old

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,400
things open poster as my

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,319
my headshot for the last few months so

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,800
how did a nice girl like me end up in a

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,479
space like open source

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,080
back in the annals of history at the

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,720
beginning of 2008

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,479
i was employed by a company i'm sure you

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,680
all know canonical

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,400
and i was employee 165 and i was

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,919
employed

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,400
to set up and run the legal team

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,240
which i did for five years and i was

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,160
there from the beginning of 2008 to the

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
very end of 2012.

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,599
so a lot of transition and a lot of

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,360
development across

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,360
both ubuntu and the the face of business

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,280
and open source

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,280
and as i say that that really shaped a

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,919
lot of my thinking

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,160
when i joined canonical i joined as a a

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,840
commercial lawyer a general counsel

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,879
somebody who had spent

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,400
at that stage i think about 12 years uh

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,599
being an in-house counsel

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,960
and i had been a head of legal since

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,280
2004 so almost five years in

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,560
um in fact it's my second general

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,879
council role

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,560
and for me i had no understanding really

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,160
of what open source meant when i joined

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
canonical of course

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,639
you know i could have defined it i could

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,840
have written you a clause for a contract

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,440
but i had no real idea and not only did

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,959
i have no real idea

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,159
what it was all about also i didn't

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,000
actually have

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,640
any concept that it would be something

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,200
that for me became an absolute passion

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,800
and would have led me to spend a lot of

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,279
the rest of my career

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,959
working in open i've had a few other

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,040
jobs since i left canonical

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,880
on the legal side um

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,560
working in fintech and working for a

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,839
data center

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,279
and the fintech was particularly

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,360
interesting because i was working in

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,120
emerging markets across places like

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,720
algeria bangladesh ukraine pakistan

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,480
and was doing financial transactions

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,279
across the mobile for a russian mobile

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,680
phone company

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,399
so really interesting stuff but all the

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,640
way through

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,519
i've kept my role going with oin and

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,000
i've

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,279
continued to work in a variety of open

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
source projects

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,600
and that's because open source really

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,920
really became a personal passion for me

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,120
so when i moved back from amsterdam

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
where i was working for the russian

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,279
mobile phone company

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,959
um about three years ago a couple of

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,480
people who had set up

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,120
the open uk organization approached me

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,519
and they approached me to get on board

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,120
and

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,880
to join the organization and i will be

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,640
absolutely honest my initial reaction

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,519
was that it wasn't interesting

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,200
and it wasn't interesting to me because

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,600
at that stage

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,640
i just didn't understand the real value

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,440
that these local

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,560
organizations could have i had worked on

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,480
a personal level

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,560
internationally since 2000 and with uh

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,600
open source and all the stuff that i

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,160
worked on there

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,640
it was attending global conferences it

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,399
was

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,839
partnering and being part of projects

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,160
all over the world

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,880
so the the uk didn't massively interest

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,079
me

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,720
and it was only really when i sat down

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:25,279
and i watched what was going on

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
in europe not just brexit but a little

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,399
bit more broadly

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,560
that i realized the value that these

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,279
organizations can and will have

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,560
not just uh through brexit but on an

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,560
ongoing basis

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,320
and that is something i hope will evolve

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,760
as we go through this talk

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,720
so um open uk

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,480
became more attractive to me and it it

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,040
became more attractive

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,959
because i realized that the commission

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,959
has been very engaged for the last

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,560
couple of years across europe

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,240
during lockdown we've actually seen the

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,760
european parliament

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,800
set up a new rule new regulation

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,000
requiring all european institutions to

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,399
use open source

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,440
now we've had that kind of policy in the

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,320
uk

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,440
for a decade or more the problem is it's

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,279
something that's not

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,120
actually followed it's something that's

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,240
paid lip service to

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,120
so what we see is that the europeans

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
have gone that step

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
further and they've said that there must

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,760
be an audit associated with that

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,240
software usage so every institution will

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,920
be annually audited to make sure

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,440
that they have in fact um complied with

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,360
that open fresh ruling

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,959
something we don't have in the uk and

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,640
it's a brilliant example of what i

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,240
thought might happen as i saw the

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,320
commission's engagement

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,160
and i saw the relative lack of

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,200
engagement in the uk

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,600
and the focus of course being on um

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,959
getting through the brexit process now

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,560
that was long before any of us knew the

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,519
pandemic was around the corner or that

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
we were going to be dealing with

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,240
lockdowns

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,240
but we obviously had major concerns

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,800
about where the uk was going

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,480
and whether or not we could i can make

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,200
that into something positive

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
and a real opportunity for the uk which

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,959
i hope we will

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,240
and for me that opportunity largely

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,639
comes out of the people

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,279
and we have the most amazing people in

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,360
the uk

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,560
with incredible experience in open

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,399
technology

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,760
i was very cross back at full stem i

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,880
went to an open forum europe

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,399
presentation

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,399
where someone got up and said the uk

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,959
lacked skills and open and it's

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,480
absolute boulder dash to use a very

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,600
british term

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,880
um the uk is overrun with open

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,519
technology talent

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,600
the problem is we don't know it and we

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,760
haven't brought them together

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,279
and when we sat down and started to

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,279
assess who was here

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,120
you would be so surprised at the quality

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,240
of the people

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,920
so for me i decided that it was worth

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,360
taking a punt with open uk

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,160
and although i pretty much work

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,959
full-time a lot of the time on open uk

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,000
i've taken on a part-time role as ceo

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,920
i'm on the board

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,519
and i'm on a number of our our work

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,480
groups and committees

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,959
um i pulled together the most amazing

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,959
board

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,480
and with the kind of talent that i'm

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,320
talking about in the uk i'm sure that's

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,040
no great surprise to you

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,720
we have people like neil mcgovern and

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,959
rob mcqueen from gnome

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,399
don foster from vmware matt jarvis

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:26,000
taran sedan who was running nhsx as open

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,519
uh source uh including the trekking to

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,160
earth test and trace app as it's now

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
called

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,920
whilst he was on secondment at uh the

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,120
nhsx project you know incredible

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,720
incredible people

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,399
we don't just have those software people

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,160
we have people from hardware like john

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,399
lebanon and andrew katz who

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,360
was the author of the cern open hardware

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,440
license

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,800
and open data folk like jenny tennyson

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,959
from the odi

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,120
so i pulled together this amazing board

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,920
and we met actually in this building in

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,279
london

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,199
back in january and we sat down

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,959
and we spent a day where i had not

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,639
expected us to be able to come to

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,720
consensus or agreement

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,720
and was absolutely amazed that we were

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,600
able to get this vision together in that

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,920
day

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,279
and our vision as an organization is to

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,639
develop and sustain

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,199
uk leadership in open technology

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,079
and we came up with a definition that we

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,079
think is universal of open technology

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,240
which is open source software open

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,360
hardware and open data

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,360
and with those three opens we end up we

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,320
believe covering anything of relevance

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,560
around the open

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,639
space i believe we're the first

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,079
organization anywhere in the world

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,079
actively uniting those three and

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,000
being honest about it there are some who

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,760
are dabbling and who've brought hardware

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,560
projects or data projects into their

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,240
remit

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,760
but none who are actually saying that

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,880
their remit is the

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,320
three opens and open technology and

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,560
one of the things that we've done a lot

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,040
of as open uk is to create visuals we've

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,880
found that visuals really help to engage

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,399
with the community

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,320
so how are we going to build this uh uk

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,079
leadership well i've mentioned that we

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,399
already have a lot of talent

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,120
and what we have to do with that talent

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,839
is to build a visible and live community

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,560
around open technology and we do that by

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,040
uniting people across various projects

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,959
by influencing legal and policy to make

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,279
sure that the uk is a fabulous place to

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,920
do

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,519
open business and by building education

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,199
and learning and open technology

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
and i'm going to take maybe 10 15

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,959
minutes to run through some of those

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:35,120
so we build a visible and loud community

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:37,759
around the um around open

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,199
technology in the uk by united people

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,360
across communities

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,360
and we are not specific to any one

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,440
project we don't hold code

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,839
we are here as an industry organization

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,079
and advocacy group to make open work

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,000
better

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,440
we run our own projects a lot of which

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,160
are around legal and policy

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,000
legal as you would expect would include

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,360
commenting on legislation but policy is

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,079
really really broad

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
and we also communicate with our broad

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,279
audience

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,480
through a variety of events and

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,720
activities

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
we've got a large number of blogs and

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,880
we're now moving to

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,079
launch a podcast early next year uh we

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,279
have mailing lists

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,160
where anybody is welcome to join and our

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,320
events

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,279
sadly haven't been quite as many as we

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,040
would have hoped

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,440
and you may notice at the very end there

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,279
awards 20th of october i am completely

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,880
insane and you'll now understand my

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,120
sparkles and my hairdo

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,120
but our open uk awards are taking place

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,560
in a couple of hours time

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,040
and again i'll come back to those in a

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,199
little bit more detail in a moment

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,320
so the awards i'll come back to them

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,199
right now uh

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,360
open uk is hosting its first awards this

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,759
evening hence my being in central london

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
we wanted to have some lovely engagement

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,440
with our community

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,800
where there's a couple of us hosting and

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,959
we'll be in different cities with

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,199
different landmarks behind us

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,920
and the awards are all about celebrating

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,439
uk leadership in open technology

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,919
we had 84 entries which i was blown away

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,319
by

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,839
in our first year and those entries are

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,760
across six categories

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,919
and the six categories are open source

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,839
software open hardware

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,600
open data individual

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,039
young person and that's one of the

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,720
categories that was just

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,360
most amazing and um

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,200
finos sponsored fintech and finance and

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,000
open source award

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,480
and uh we whittled down a short list of

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,360
three

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,760
our judges include jenny tennyson from

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,679
the

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:43,600
odi henry nash of ibm

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,000
and katie gimanji who is at amex

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,760
now they have a really tough time

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,880
creating that short list and deciding

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,240
who the winners will be

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,919
and the winners will be announced this

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,880
evening

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,640
that event will actually also include

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,840
our kids competition winners and i'll

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,320
talk to you a bit more about those in a

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,600
moment

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,200
so that the way we are bringing people

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,960
together i'm gonna go back to that slide

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
the way we're bringing together

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,720
will be through things like events

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,600
through things like our rewards through

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,400
recognition of

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,520
individuals building the collective

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,520
social media

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,280
we've gone from having about 600 people

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
in our social media and our twitter

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,640
following

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,039
to almost 1500 i think we're about 30

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,600
short of 1500 today

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,120
when we tweet some of our tweets the

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,960
impressions will be between fifty and a

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,880
hundred thousand

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,240
that is incredible for an organization

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,799
that nine months ago

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,960
nobody had heard of and our trajectory

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,400
has been through the roof

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,400
um within weeks of

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
launching the organization we were being

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,360
asked if it would be possible for

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,720
us to create a model that we could roll

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
out in other countries

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,679
and that is something that we're

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,160
seriously looking at and i'll talk to

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,400
you about towards the end

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,320
so as well as our community work as i

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
said we're influencing legal and policy

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
to make sure the uk is a great place to

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,080
do open

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,320
and that's involved us commenting on uk

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,880
and european legislation

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,480
i think probably because we had such

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,600
highly skilled individuals

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,160
in the uk in this area it was very very

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,640
easy

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,080
for us to build a very strong group in

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,400
no time at all

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,760
and for that group to be recognized not

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,799
just in the uk but internationally

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,360
and we were asked by february to go and

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,000
meet with

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,000
uk government's trade negotiators

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,760
working on the brexit trade

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,080
agreements and to help them with

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,919
provisions that relate to source code

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,760
so we had some good discussions with

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,440
them um

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,120
trying to ensure that any source code

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,960
provisions in the treaties

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,880
will be compliant with open source

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,200
requirements

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,400
and we've also worked on a joint report

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,280
with the

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,960
commission's open source observatory and

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,200
it was really flattering that we had

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,000
been identified by them in such a short

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,480
time

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,600
as the actor in the uk the strategic

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,720
partner that you would go to in the uk

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,000
there is both a long document and a

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,159
one-page pdf

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,320
on the also website that i recommend to

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,039
you which has a full overview of the

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,080
status

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,559
of open source in the uk and then our

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,280
third

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,679
our third piece of work has been to

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
build

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,919
education and learning in open

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,919
technology

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,039
we've had a kids competition now the

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,039
kids competition was something that we

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,360
had in place right at the beginning of

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,400
the year and i have to say after all the

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,200
work we've done

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,880
that course changing broke my heart we

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,360
had arranged for

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,360
the winners from each of the five uk

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,679
regions to come to london

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,200
red hat was sponsoring github have also

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,520
given us some support

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,679
and covered our admin costs and we were

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,400
bringing the kids to london

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,000
to do a day's work in the red hat

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,200
innovation labs

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,039
where they would also be

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
meeting the singer the double grammy

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,440
award-winning singer imogen heap

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,799
and spending the day with her and

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,840
unfortunately

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,960
by march april we were already realizing

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,080
that 2020 was not a year to move kids

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,080
around the uk

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,840
it certainly wasn't a year to ask

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,600
children to share

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
a glove and at the heart of our

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,120
competition is something called the

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,159
minimum glove

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,400
which is a kids version of imogen heaps

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:34,559
software glove musical software glove

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,520
absolutely gutting having that in place

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,799
and losing it

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,480
but i think this shows our resilience

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,120
and our determination

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,960
and i'm quite proud of this we repurpose

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,200
the monies that we had for

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,400
that travel and that day or two nights

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,480
in london

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,760
and we spent it instead on building a

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,840
kids course

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,520
i think our kids course which is

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,440
available at www dot

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,720
open uk dot uk backslash open kids camp

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,480
is probably the first set of educational

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,760
materials of its kind

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,919
for children it's uh an animated course

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,720
using the minimum glob the minimum glove

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,000
is available from pymeroni it's 40

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,159
pounds with a micro bit

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,320
30 without so it's not an expensive

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,760
piece of cake

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,240
the course is 10 animated lessons

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,480
around 10 minutes long each and each of

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,360
which spends a minute explaining open

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,440
source

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,120
and it goes through what source code is

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,880
what open source means

copyright licensing creating a community

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,840
modifications and improving other

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,880
people's code and then resharing code

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,520
it's an absolutely brilliant course and

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,000
the singer

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,039
imogen he narrated the first episode for

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,280
us

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,640
they're all available on youtube we

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,120
packaged them up with

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
10 easings and made them available as an

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,640
open kids camp

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,000
thanks to huawei we had sponsorship to

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,480
give away 3 000

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,280
mini moo glove kits to kids across the

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,880
uk

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,320
and to create a summer account from

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,320
those easings and

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,320
the course episodes it is really

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,200
fabulous and i would commend it to all

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,880
of you

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,640
we did it because we wanted to create a

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,400
splash and we wanted to

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,440
create it as a stepping stone or a

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,360
segway to building a gcse which is an

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,240
exam that 16 year olds would do in the

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,320
uk

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,760
so everybody does a set of those before

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,080
they leave school

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,080
and also an apprenticeship scheme and we

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,240
have an active group now worker two

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,240
groups working on each of those

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,080
with a view to having them in place by

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,240
2022 so our goal

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,120
is that there will be an apprenticeship

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,559
scheme

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,080
working with a number of companies

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,120
hopefully including our sponsors and

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,720
donors

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,159
and also our qualification and academic

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,480
qualification

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,640
which will be available as an option to

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,679
high school students and also available

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,360
in colleges

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,279
so watch this space we hope to be

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,080
launching that by the end of 2021

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,760
and for children and young people to be

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,679
entering our apprenticeship scheme in

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,400
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,960
and we also set up a university group

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,080
which

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,440
is something that i think is fair to say

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,200
has totally

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,960
suffered from the the consequences of

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,000
the pandemic

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,400
the group fell away as we went into

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,679
lockdown we had intended to resurrect it

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,880
in september

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,799
i don't know about the rest of the world

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,880
but here in the uk people going to

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,960
university for the first time

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,880
universities trying to manage the

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,840
pandemic situation has been very very

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,559
difficult

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,919
so we've decided to leave that on hold

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,840
until january

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,080
at some point next year assuming we're

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,799
all able to travel again we will do our

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,240
posse

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,400
professors open source software

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,919
education thanks to the sponsorship of

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,760
red hat and google

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,919
and this is a little bit of the

00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,080
[Music]

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,440
marketing collateral from the kids

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,039
competition

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,120
and that's our course

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,880
for may and our competition in september

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,039
so that's post pandemic

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,360
and that's an image of the mini moog

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,360
love

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,200
actually as part of our process maimu

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,520
the company who owns the minimum glove

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,279
open source the hardware and the gloves

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,679
so it is possible if you get hold of a

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,480
micro bit to build your own glove with a

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,480
speaker

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,840
a couple of other things and this is one

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,400
of the stills which will give you a

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,600
sense

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:33,279
of the the graphics in our

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,440
animated animation even and it gives you

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,960
just a feel for what we were doing and

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,840
that's with image and heap in the first

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,919
episode

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,440
they really are fabulous and i can't say

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,200
that i'm going to get much more excited

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,039
in life than to hear imogen heap

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
explaining open source

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,960
the feedback we've had from the chorus

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,080
and from the competition

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:56,400
has often revolved around girls and

00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:00,159
with a a role model like imogen

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,400
and somebody so creative what we found

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,520
is that we've been told that a number of

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,480
girls who

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,400
thought quotes coding would be boring

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,080
have been really excited to be making

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,760
music through lockdown and

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,760
actually are keen to do more coding

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,320
we are very honored to be one of 20

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,840
phase one winners in the new gnome

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,440
community engagement challenge

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,720
now with 20 winners it sounds like quite

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,799
a lot but actually i think there were

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,960
148 entrants

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,000
so it's a very big deal for us and we

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,799
are working now

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,320
on uh our submission to the second round

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,159
so keep your fingers crossed for us we'd

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,919
be very excited to get through

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,679
we've already won a thousand dollars and

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,360
the next stage the prize monies would

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,960
help us with next year

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,480
i believe that we will be doing a

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,679
further kids competition

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,440
and also a further course with red hat

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,919
which means that we will hopefully be

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,760
running our summer camp again

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,360
with the the course we've already done

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,279
but fingers crossed we'll have a second

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,360
one too

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,320
and one project that's a little bit left

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,960
field is

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,760
ditto develop in the open and that's a

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,240
project that's

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,960
innovate uk funded and around open

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,039
healthcare

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,400
it's creating an eo and open source eob

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,480
system

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,919
with innovate funding and we've been

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,840
involved on more of the sort of

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,279
governance and support side

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,200
and in doing that we have been um

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,200
working with the open chain project to

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,279
make sure that our outputs are

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,960
open chain compliant and ditto is going

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,279
to be the first project

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,360
as opposed to organizational company

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,880
that is open chain compliant we'll be

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,279
sharing a case study on that quite soon

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,360
so how is open uk being run well i've

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,480
mentioned that i'm working mostly

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,799
almost pretty much full time although i

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,080
am paid part-time and i'm spending a lot

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,679
of my time speaking

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,120
i didn't write this but apparently i'm

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,840
also inspiring i hope i

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,520
am and leading which i am definitely

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,880
doing there is a lot of leading being

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,480
done right now

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,720
i am supported by an admin a couple of

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,039
days a week and both the admin and i

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,399
received some level of remuneration

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,360
the rest of the leadership team are

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,760
volunteers andrew katz has been our gc

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,320
since january and been invaluable

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,399
we have the most amazing vp of comms a

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,159
chap called mark hember from one bite

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,600
who has been volunteering since february

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,000
when he found us

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,919
and i have to say mark has been a

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,200
wonderful support and entree

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,480
across a huge amount of

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,720
um i guess different

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,559
different places in the tech sector he

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,559
brings us lots of opportunity

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,399
and i'm hoping that the new board which

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:41,200
covers business development

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,279
community legal and policy and learning

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,840
support functions like the cfo

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,919
role and also a new role that we've

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,520
developed called a partnership one

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,200
i'm hoping they'll bring a lot to it

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,200
that partnership role is actually just

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,679
worth explaining to you

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,120
we have joined as many open source

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,159
organizations across

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,159
across the globe as we can and we want

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,360
to really engage and participate

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,640
we're not a a narrow inward looking open

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,919
source organization

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,919
that's country specific

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,320
the country's specific because we want

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,000
to know our neighbors and work with them

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,440
but we want to participate in big

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,120
international projects

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,200
so we've joined eclipse and the linux

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,440
foundation we've joined open compute

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,279
the open hardware group various

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
organizations and our partnership

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,559
director

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,399
jamie is coming on board so that he can

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,000
help us to identify

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,880
where there's opportunity for folk in

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,080
the uk to work with and represent us on

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,919
those organizations and those should be

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,520
some really fantastic opportunities for

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,320
people that they may not otherwise have

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,000
had

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,760
but it will also i hope make sure that

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,320
we have good representation around the

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,080
world

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,080
and are really an active part of the

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,440
open source community

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,880
um we also have many volunteers who work

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,799
on different work streams

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,000
or who are part of our different

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,399
activities

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,919
and i've shared with you i mean nothing

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,200
for us is particularly confidential i've

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,720
shared with you

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,559
some of the exciting new people that

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,159
we've brought on board one of the things

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,760
i love about the leadership team

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,360
is that we've intentionally brought

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,279
people on who

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,039
you won't know they're not the usual

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,279
figures from open source in the uk

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,720
or open hardware open data to some

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,480
extent our board is and i

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,640
am we're the people that you see

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,120
speaking at conferences all the time

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,120
but these sort of eight new people are

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,440
all people who have a passion for open

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,679
who

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,640
really want to learn and be involved and

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,720
engage

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,080
so i would ask that if any of you meet

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,760
any of my team

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,679
my wonderful leadership team at a

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,520
conference that you take some time to

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,840
talk to them and help them to integrate

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,080
and to meet new folks around open

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,600
because they really are the future and

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,399
that that's what we're all about

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,520
developing that uk leadership not in a

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,840
xenophobic way

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,840
not in an insular way but developing the

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,000
talent that we have to participate in a

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,159
global stage

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,799
and um you can see we've broken those

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,080
down into the different groups as well

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,799
so how are we being funded well when it

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,640
was first

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,399
instigated open uk was a membership

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,120
organization and that's

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,960
not for me i feel very very strongly

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,399
that i want to lead an organization that

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,360
follows a model where anyone can

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,440
participate

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,360
and that's what we're all about anybody

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,360
who wants to come along to one of our

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,679
events anybody who wants to

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,600
join any of our projects can so long as

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,880
they follow our code of conduct

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,120
and our competition policy however

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,840
in terms of funding the organization as

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,440
of today we also have a supporter model

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,880
where individuals can pay a small

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,640
monthly subscription

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,960
and receive a number of benefits by

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,880
doing so for me the key benefit

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,240
there is that they will be able once

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,440
they've spent six months

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,919
as a subscriber as a supporter they will

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,799
be able to vote in our board elections

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,159
and to stand

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,880
to be part of that board should they

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,399
wish now those elections will take place

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,760
annually for half of the board

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,120
it will follow the scottish stv system

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,159
and

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,399
we've had a lot of input from the board

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,240
to get that right

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,320
the first election should take place i

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,679
believe in september next year and that

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,519
will be for half the board and

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,000
thereafter we will see half the board

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,799
resign

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,399
and move annually and we restrict the

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,559
number of terms they have

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:23,120
so obviously that's very important to us

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,200
but building that subscriber base

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,960
is also very important because the sub

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,320
the supporter base will be what

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,799
pays for the basic organizational costs

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,679
paying for our overhead for myself for

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,240
admin

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,200
for more employees and contractors over

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,799
time people

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,640
building competitions and people

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,960
building

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,640
skilled activities like the course need

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,679
to be paid they can't be on a volunteer

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,320
basis

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,519
and uh that's where we then look for

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,039
sponsors and donors

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,039
we have a number of donors including

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,120
microsoft google arm and facebook

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,039
who very generously have funded us to

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,960
allow the organization to exist and

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,360
generally achieve our goals

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,200
and then we have specific sponsors who

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,799
sponsor events like red hat

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,120
and github who sponsored our kids

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,880
competition huawei who sponsored the

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,960
giveaway and the kids camp

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,279
and bristows who are sponsoring the open

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,200
source awards taking place this evening

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,600
we have in-kind sponsorship from number

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,679
of organizations providing us with staff

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,039
and resourcing and uh specialist advice

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,799
and also uh organizations like field

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,840
official the law firm whose offices i'm

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,880
in today

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,559
who will provide office space

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,159
and there's a bit more detail here about

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,480
the individual supporters but i'm

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,880
slightly conscious of time

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,159
i'm just going to reiterate that in

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,760
terms of participants

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,600
anyone can participate and our

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,679
participants are made up of our

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,440
supporters

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,519
individuals who just want to be part of

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,799
a project or organizations who want to

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,240
be part of a project

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:58,080
donors sponsors friends members

00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,399
we have a big and welcoming organization

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,200
our finance for 2021 as i've mentioned

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,360
will expand into that supporter area

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,960
and in 2021 we are already planning a

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,280
number of activities

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
we intend to hold a second awards let's

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,480
hope fingers crossed that tonight works

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,560
out okay

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,240
and we will have a second edition of the

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,639
skills competition sponsored by red hat

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,960
we look to build our supporters by a

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,919
number of interactive events

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,679
if we are able we will be creating pods

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,919
for people to get together in

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,879
across the uk so that they can enjoy

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:32,560
full stem

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,240
in small groups but of course like

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,599
everybody else we're in an environment

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,000
where we don't know

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,919
what's going to happen we were obviously

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,760
at a medium level of alert in london

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,560
we've moved to high we're still able to

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,480
do

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,480
a certain amount of meeting outdoors but

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,960
we wouldn't be able to meet indoors and

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,200
groups

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,800
for that at the moment so fingers

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,280
crossed we get back to being a medium

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,720
and

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,480
across the uk and that we're able to

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,040
participate in activities face to face

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,960
we're also gearing up to continue with

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,119
our online activities

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,280
i would commend to you our future leader

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,720
sessions at noon on friday they're also

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,160
available on youtube

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,560
we've got some of the great and the good

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,640
of open source giving a presentation of

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,480
around 40 45 minutes

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,240
covers all aspects this week we have

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,680
rancher talking about running an open

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,160
source business

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,800
and it's a great opportunity in a very

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,480
informal space to learn about open

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:32,000
to meet some new people and to

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,520
um to learn about open so

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,359
with the future leaders group i should

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,480
briefly mention them it's a group of

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,800
younger business

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,640
um people generally not developers but

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,520
developers would be very welcome

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,880
and the people who come into contact

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,720
with or want to know more about

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,000
open as part of their business perhaps

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,760
they have an expertise in one of the

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,320
three opens and not at all

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,839
and that group is also doing a review of

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,079
government procurement terms

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,800
and processes and we'll be providing a

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,000
report a little later this year

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,079
now excitingly i'm sharing with you uh

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,440
i'm sharing this for the first time now

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,119
that we are working

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,560
with people in kenya to create a pilot

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,960
in the spring probably q1 q2 next year

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,040
where we will federate the open uk model

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,960
the three opens the three pillars

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,119
community legal and policy and learning

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,640
and hope that that will allow us to

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,760
create a sustainable model that's

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,320
replicable

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,760
in a useful way across other countries

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,280
obviously every country is going to have

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,880
its own flavor to add

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,760
but we hope that we've done something

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,079
that's uh useful and replicable

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,400
so with that i'm going to leave you i

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,240
hope that this has been a useful session

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:48,000
i'm very grateful to you for coming

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:48,000
