Abstract: With the rise of COVID-19, all communities have had to adapt to virtual events. How though, do you run an amazing in-person or virtual event? What kind of content, speakers, facilities, and other elements do you need? How do you coordinate your resources in the most effective way, and what are the landmines we should avoid? This is what we want to dig into in this discussion. Bring the knowledge!

in-person events

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,880
so there's several different ways that

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,000
you can join the conversation you can

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,760
add

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,199
you can ask your question or comment and

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,160
chat you can put it in the q

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,599
a or as everybody is joining i am

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,960
promoting you to panelists you can

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,039
unmute

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,399
your audio and your camera and you can

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,040
join the conversation

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,520
that way while we're getting started

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,520
here

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,680
um and you know getting

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120
uh you know we can i was mentioning this

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,640
earlier we can talk about

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
many different things when it comes to

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,800
online and in-person events but

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,800
i'd like to know sort of what you all

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,719
would like to get out of this

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,480
um and what areas you would like to talk

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,879
about i believe

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,399
uh the link to the google doc where we

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,320
can take no

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,160
notes as a whole because i can't take

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,879
notes and talk so i'll have to rely on

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
you all

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,880
um you know it's uh in the chat

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,320
so if you can add that as we start

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,560
talking but please let me know

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,680
um what you'd like to get out or what

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,600
your questions are

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,479
so um amber i'm just gonna make a

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,759
comment

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,880
on the all things open launch for your

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,159
event

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,640
it's going to the other track and

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
someone talking about incentives

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
um so i don't know how you interact with

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,320
him but you need to have him

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,240
put the launch for this one in his chat

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,520
i just launched the thing for the things

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,759
that samantha ran

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,759
to get back here oh okay

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,479
yeah we're definitely aware of the issue

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
which is why we went ahead and started

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,840
the session about five minutes

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,040
uh later but we don't want to cut into

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
the talk so we're just

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,079
to get started and as people come

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,520
through

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,880
um just let people know in the chat and

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,880
welcome them from jonas talk

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,840
sounds good uh let me at least

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,160
to amber's question about what some

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,879
things that that would be helpful for me

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,920
um i come at this from a bit of the

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,360
technical side

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,160
in terms of like how to you know uh

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,360
do a lot of the back end things manage

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,879
getting cfps

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
and and you know even doing some of the

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,000
av stuff which i'm happy to talk about

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
but i'd be interested to see uh a little

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,959
bit about

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,160
how do we make events stand out

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,800
these days because it the the it's good

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,280
and bad

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,720
that the the barrier to entry to host a

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,360
conference or an event

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,120
uh or in any kind of community event uh

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
has been lowered significantly but with

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,760
that has

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,599
opened the floodgates where it seems as

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,879
though there's always

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,879
some virtual event happening and so

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,080
some of that as a as a viewer is

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,480
overwhelming

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
but as a conference organizer it becomes

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,680
difficult

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,239
to connect with an audience and say you

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,200
know this

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,800
this this is uh something that maybe you

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,400
specifically might be interested in so

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,519
i'd i'd love to hear

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,720
uh ideas and and maybe uh some other you

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,400
know ways that we kind of

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,239
organize that and and uh deconflict

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
and and get ourselves out there a little

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,640
bit better

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:31,440
perfect um can one of you all

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,040
um let's see let's see

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,319
i needed to get a message to todd but i

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,920
don't have the link um

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,239
to the other session because i've been

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,560
moderating so trying to multitask here

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
so

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,239
i apologize if it seems like my head

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,280
blink here

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,760
yeah so jono just needs the link

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,519
to send them here can you maybe drop

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,920
over there and then

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,920
thanks appreciate it

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,239
so how do how do most of you all start

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,239
like do you just say i want to have an

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,599
event and you just go out and pick a

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,680
date in a venue or

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,519
do you actually have i have a checklist

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,319
but i i said i would give it at the end

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,560
of the day

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,400
um how do you um look at

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,079
planning your event and two if anybody's

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,320
converted like we did last week

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,759
converted an in-person event to

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,120
a virtual event

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,280
what did you have to do to do that or

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,680
would you like more information on that

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,199
okay so i mean i can speak up i'm i'm

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,000
very involved in what are called hybrid

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,080
events

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,919
um hybrid events is when you have some

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,199
people

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,400
meeting but then you know 95 percent

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,120
are virtual um and this started

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,160
happening

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,479
in april in los angeles with a lot of

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,320
entertainment related uh technology

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,720
events and has continued

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,759
uh the major thing is keep it the same

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
night

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,759
um don't start moving if you have a if

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,199
it's always the second tuesday of the

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,720
month don't decide it should be the

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,639
third tuesday of the month

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,120
or god forbid it should be at one in the

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,160
afternoon instead of seven at night

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,880
um but the checklist is the same

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,680
the biggest key is that if you've got

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,440
people

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,520
entering virtually who are going to

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,759
speak make sure they have

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,840
good sound so i've got a decent light

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
behind me on a home today

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,280
um i should be in a lit up space if i

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,120
have to present

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,400
i should be on something better than my

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,520
webcam video

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,280
uh and my my i have a good microphone

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
that you can't see but it's down on my

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,000
desk at the moment

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,680
um but these are things that are basic

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,440
and there's a lot of information for

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,759
hybrid events out there

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,520
amber if you've got some i think sharing

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,400
it in your google doc would be really

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,880
good

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,800
and i will get into that before the

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,800
session is over and add some links

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,639
perfect

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,080
so aaron it looks like you're in here

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,280
like five different times

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,000
um i i suspect that's because i put my

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
link down

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,759
and so everyone's probably joining with

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,639
my name i apologize for that

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,440
so those folks who are joining um who

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,720
say that

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,800
um your name is aaron soto you can go

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,000
into the participation or the

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,639
participants list

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
click click on your name and change your

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,039
name

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,280
um that way um

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
the correct way which is to go back to

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
the schedule and just launch one of the

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,759
other talks in track two

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,360
which will bring you back to this room

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,360
but as yourself in case you don't want

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,919
to steal my identity

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
but i i volunteered myself for this i

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,319
brought this on myself

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,319
so uh well here we are aaron we're gonna

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,319
need your credit card number for that

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,960
uh ask any any number of the other aaron

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:49,120
photos they'll be glad to help you out

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,759
so so we we've we've talked about how to

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,720
make uh

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,880
one of the questions how to make your

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,199
events stand out the the hybrid events

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,319
were

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,120
within this new this new i'm not going

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
to say the word

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,039
this this the way we have to do things

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
now um

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,880
you know it looks like um there's going

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,039
to be some in person

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,280
and some you know remote participation

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,039
op options going forward like

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,120
how do you how do you look at that um

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,560
anything else um

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,840
that people are hoping to

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,479
get out of this session

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,319
i apologize for the confusion um all

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,319
things open had jonah and i

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,000
switched back and forth and then both

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,520
links went to jono's session so

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,280
you know we're all learning how to do

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,880
this together there's going to be

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
hiccups and it's how you handle those

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,720
hiccups that really just keep the ball

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
rolling so we're just going to keep

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,960
talking about that stuff and at the end

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,479
of this

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,479
when we do the wrap-up session this

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,280
afternoon i'll actually put a checklist

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,199
in so

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,759
one of the things that i think a lot of

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,199
folks forget to do when it comes to

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,199
your events people go oh we want to have

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,400
this event great and they go out and

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,400
they pick a date and then they find a

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,199
venue but what they don't ask is

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,479
often why what is the mission statement

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,840
for this event

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,400
why are you doing that event um and who

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,039
are

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,759
you hoping what's your audience like and

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,840
then people

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,879
also while you know it in the back of

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,440
your mind

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,160
you probably don't always think about it

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,479
but

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,840
you know what why do people attend

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,240
events and there's usually

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,039
two reasons why people attend events and

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,520
that is

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,840
an education side of it and a networking

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,240
side of it and usually for

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,280
companies they attend events to grow

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,199
their business

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,720
so even though there's a lot of little

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,560
things that fall underneath all those

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,279
categories it's usually education and

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,680
networking

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,919
for you as an individual and then to

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,760
grow your business as an organization so

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,120
the why is really important so your

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,519
mission statement and your

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
target audience and making sure that

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,279
your events

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,000
um appeal to both the individual and the

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,040
organization

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,279
especially when you're trying to sell

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,080
sponsorships if it's free that's a

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,360
you know different uh different animal

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,800
there but

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,360
uh but especially when it comes to

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,279
sponsorships any thoughts on that or

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,399
like any mistakes that maybe someone

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,080
made early on

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,440
on i know when i first started doing

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,240
this 15 20 years ago when i was in the

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,240
hotel industry um we would just do

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,080
events and we would put them on but

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,839
i then when i started learning to ask

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,519
the client like why do you want to do

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,320
this how can we make your event better

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,160
that sort of led into um you know where

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,480
we are where i am today but what about

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,360
you

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,560
any thoughts on um that particular piece

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,560
of the planning part of it

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
i think a little bit of it is the who

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,040
but also i mean

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
trying to figure out like what what is

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,959
that no not only the mission statement

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,399
like the why but like

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,160
who is the person who we're targeting

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,040
who should be coming to this event and

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,160
so i notice a lot of times events will

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,440
have you know a mix of introductory

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,360
uh type talks and then some you know

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,480
headline type talks that are a little

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,720
more advanced and i'm thinking

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,760
probably a little more technical uh but

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,880
but things that if you're an

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,839
introductory person

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,880
it's daunting it's overwhelming um and

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,480
so

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,320
for example one of the conferences that

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,640
i really enjoyed working with was one

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,519
called

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,200
introsec con and it was all about for

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,560
those that are introducing themselves to

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,360
information security

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,800
and it was a platform both for for

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,200
people who are just getting started

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
to present but also for people just

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,880
getting started to see people

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,560
who are not too dissimilar from

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,279
themselves who are just learning the

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,680
ropes

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,399
and maybe just a few steps ahead of them

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,399
and so

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,839
in that i think uh i think that

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,200
conference was a success

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,680
because we did a very good job at

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,839
targeting the who uh and saying if

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,760
you're just starting out

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,120
this is the place for you there's no

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,120
egos there's no

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,320
uh nothing to to to make you feel

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,399
uh you know like you don't belong um so

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,160
in addition to your question of why i

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,839
would say uh who should be

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,640
uh attending ideally um this is a key

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,160
question

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,160
any other thoughts from folks

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,440
just out of curiosity um maybe

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,399
i don't know how we're going to do this

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,200
but um or just say

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,880
raise your hand in the uh the chat how

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,079
many folks here have actually

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,959
planned an event or first you know how

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,120
many folks

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,120
have planned an event um

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,800
yeah um so my main day job is actually

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,959
uh for a scientific conferencing company

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,360
that serves primary scientists

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,320
and uh our job is to keep peer review

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
going and

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,240
like the science must go on right covet

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,720
happened and we had

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,040
international events all over the world

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,760
uh we were running 65

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,160
and then when covet happened uh the

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,680
company needed to pivot

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,720
all 65 meetings uh which kind of became

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,279
like this massive gargantuan task

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,079
and uh i'm gonna be honest like we just

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,560
man our

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,000
brute forced it which really honestly

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,839
felt a bit toxic

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
uh for the company and we hadn't really

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,320
proved

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,920
that the virtual event system that we

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,560
had developed

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,839
for one event was actually capable of

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,839
scaling

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,959
which created this massive problem for

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,279
us where

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,079
we had four people in marketing who are

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,200
all familiar

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,240
with the tools well enough to run 65

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,959
events

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,079
and then we had 36 other people in the

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,519
company

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:38,720
who had nothing to do so

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,040
how do we manage that uh

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,920
when there are 65 events and you just

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,200
don't have

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,200
proof enough to scale

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,360
so one of the things and that aaron and

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,720
i kind of looked at when we were

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,000
both planning our ctfs that we do

00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,000
and our um our conferences and stuff was

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,040
what do we already have that people know

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,760
how to use

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,160
what how can we link things together and

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,160
not

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,839
expand costs or um like all things open

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,600
uh todd was saying to most of the

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,040
speakers that hey they didn't want to

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,720
bring in another yet another tool if

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,920
somebody had to read documentation and

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,839
learn and and

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,120
and it might go wrong i mean we're

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,560
seeing hiccups today and

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,880
i would much rather be with my session

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,399
than one of the other

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,639
main sessions where the hiccups happen

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,160
but um

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,240
and so one of the things that we do is

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,680
look at what what we already had and

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,959
what people could do and we

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,880
sort of went with we we went with

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,120
zoom for all the people who were

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,440
speaking so everybody who was

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,120
a speaker had the zoom link and then we

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,160
live streamed to youtube

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,680
and if people want to join the

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,279
conversation they joined the

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
conversation on slack so there's no

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,320
additional cost

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,079
whatsoever so everybody could still join

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,480
in and nobody had to learn anything

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,440
anything new so depending on your budget

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,399
like you could

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,959
you could definitely you know spend 100k

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,240
plus on a system or develop it in house

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,440
and how many ever engineering

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,279
you know how much engineering debt that

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,120
takes on um to develop something

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,639
in-house but if you already have it

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,240
that's a tool that that you already have

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,399
and you don't have to reinvest in it

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,839
so i don't know what everybody's you

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,160
know budgets are looking like

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,160
or what you're looking to do in 2021 but

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,160
one of those things is look and take

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,480
stock of what you already have

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
and see what you can make make work and

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,440
depending on

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,959
like how polished your event needs to be

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,600
or what your community

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,560
um you know is looking for or their

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,920
expectations

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,800
you can do a lot um you know with a with

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,440
a little

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,199
um and we've learned that through trial

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,360
and error

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,800
in that aspect the other thing is uh

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,279
aaron you were talking about making

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,920
things

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,000
you know stand out um one of the things

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,440
that we did with our talk is cyber

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,240
security conferences and you can look

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,480
across the board

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,680
you know the biggest one being um what

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,160
um

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,000
black hat with defcon so that that's the

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,040
uh you know the the biggest ones

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,199
you know that are out there but we're

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,240
smaller um with with more you know

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,360
a very niche community uh as one aspect

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,560
of it and so

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,360
we needed to figure out a way to

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,120
really bring in those user stories and

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,079
those people using the data

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,199
um and not just the developers so we had

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,959
you know we took a

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,880
a kind of a playbook from openstack back

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,480
in the day where you had your

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,240
developer conference and then you had

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,040
your user piece of it and

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,880
um you know sort of divided it up that

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,680
that way so we had training which made

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,759
us stand out

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,199
and then the user piece and then the

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,839
developer piece so

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,120
what about you all how would you um take

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,000
a look at your events

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,240
and make them you know really stand out

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,959
in

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,600
in the vertical that you're in it looks

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,880
like

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,560
uh chelsea are you

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,759
wanting to speak you were lit up there

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,399
for a minute

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,800
no i had just joined so i was meeting my

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,800
oh okay

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,560
all right just want to make sure i don't

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,959
miss anybody so any any points on

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:12,240
um making your event stand out we um

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,839
i wrote in chat that uh we had two large

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,040
large-ish in-person events um

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,839
that we just expanded from one to two

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,480
within a year one in london one in new

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,120
york um

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,320
and then coveted hit like everybody else

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,680
and

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,720
we we pushed we wanted to have kind of a

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,000
meet-up feel

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,240
to what we were doing and so

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,440
i mean it may sound kitschy but one of

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,639
the things that we try to do

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,000
is give away t-shirts um or

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,800
or something to make it you know they're

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,279
they're half hour virtual meetups we try

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,880
to have q and a as much as possible

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,639
um but we you know because we're calling

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,600
it a meet up we want it to feel like

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,839
that and so

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,720
every in-person meetup that we did so we

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
do like

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,039
one large event but then

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,079
um i think about six meetups per year

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,959
either in new york or in london um and

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,160
we just wanted that feel and um and

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,799
trying to make it as

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,880
i mean i'm in you know open source

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,000
technology within financial services

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,880
which is

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,079
one a real niche but two a real pain in

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,919
the butt sometimes

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,600
as far as getting people to participate

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,200
because of the close nature

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,000
of what happens in financial services

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,799
so but i've always gone back to and i

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,200
actually

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,080
i actually helped todd start all things

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,240
open

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,160
eight years ago and one of the things

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,679
that we always used to have a talk about

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,640
was like you know like

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,640
the people you know we're marketing to

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,919
companies but we're really marketing to

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,720
people and people want to

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,440
enjoy things people you know want things

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,840
people

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,080
you know people are are who gonna be or

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,760
who is going to be at the events

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,120
not always just you know companies so

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,880
it doesn't matter if they come from a

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,160
financial services company that is

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,039
locked down

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,360
and can't do open source maybe can only

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,480
do inner source we want the people

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,320
that are there that you know their

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,320
developers their marketers their you

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,400
know whomever within the organization

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,080
we want them to have a good time have a

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,120
good experience so

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,400
you know if it's giving away things um

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,679
like you would a normal

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,880
meet up um you know i i'd really i

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,880
wanted to come to this session

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,640
specifically so i could get better ideas

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,720
on how to engage

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,720
our audience more within the meetups but

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,720
also you know promoting them too

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,240
um because we're not selling anything

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,000
during it we just want

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,440
more participation within our open

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,480
source projects that we

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,000
hopes basically so you know if you have

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,559
ideas i'm

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,280
more than willing to listen if i could

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,720
jump in

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,840
um we kind of found the same thing um

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,919
so i kind of have this theory of

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,039
um if you're a brand if you're a

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,480
community if you have

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,000
any form of power uh looking at your

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,360
community in any way shape or form you

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,520
could be the bear

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,720
you could like market a whole bunch of

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,799
stuff you could say hey

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,440
here's our event hey it's free hey it's

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,320
reduced cost hey we have scholarships

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,240
or you could be the flower and say hey

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,760
we recognize things are difficult we

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,200
recognize things are hard

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,520
we're going to go ahead and pivot this

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,600
event to something that's more regular

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,919
to make sure that it matches your

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,640
uh schedule in this difficult time and

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,039
we have some

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,480
resources and we have some content we

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,960
have some

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,400
merchandise that might be really really

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,160
um good for you to have

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,320
in lieu of not having the in-person

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,880
experience and then it was being the

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,880
flower

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,320
having those resources and being there

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,039
for the community members

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:55,360
that i think led to a larger quality

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,360
over quantity kind of feel at the event

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,039
and we were looking at doing some of

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,840
that too so we we narrowed down our

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,960
talks in

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,480
a to 20-minute talks because um

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,240
especially when you're online and you're

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,400
already dealing with like

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,520
zoom fatigue or video fatigue we

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,200
narrowed it down and

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,720
there's a saying um that uh

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,240
forget who said it but i said you know i

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,200
would have made it longer but i didn't

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,720
have enough time

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,320
or i might have made it shorter but i

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,039
didn't have enough time to narrow things

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,960
down

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,440
you okay you gotta meet somebody here

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,440
okay um you know we we've

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,200
got to um you know you really got to

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,080
think about how concise and crisp your

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,520
message is going to be

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,760
so one of the things that we're looking

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,760
at that we took from our big event was

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,240
these 20-minute talks on how to expand

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,000
them

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,360
in webinars in 2021. so people want more

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
information they want to join the

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,120
discussion they want to do that

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,280
but we didn't want to have people on

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,280
camera you know and have to sit in front

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,240
of their camera for six to eight hours

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,799
um for a whole day so we just made it

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,440
you know

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,159
four hours and said here's what we'll do

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,200
you know

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,039
um in in 2021 we'll take those popular

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,919
talks and the the stuff that people are

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,720
asking for

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,159
and we'll move those to longer talks um

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,039
and that dialogue

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,000
you know in 2021 so that's one of the

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,720
ways that we

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,200
kept people um i believe at any one time

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,600
anywhere from 250 to 400 and something

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
people

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,720
engaged at one time is because we did

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,480
keep the talks

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,159
short and sweet and people could pop in

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,799
when they wanted to they could

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,240
ask their questions you know without any

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,200
intimidation or anything

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,799
from um you know being on camera with

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,039
you know experts or whatever

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,080
so we sort of removed you know that that

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,200
piece of it

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,360
um i'm sure there's other other ways

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,240
um but that was just one of the ways

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,520
that we and

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,440
and we didn't tell anybody that was

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,400
going to be recorded until the day of

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,360
so that drove it drove participation for

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,440
the event

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,559
um instead of people going oh i'll catch

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,480
the recording later

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,559
we didn't even mention that until after

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,240
the the no one actually watches the

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,240
recordings later

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,280
i have a pile of recordings that i will

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,280
get to eventually

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,799
but i think um thoughts on that

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,880
you know aaron you're you're right um uh

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,720
what was it mailchimp did a study

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
i was doing design conferences a long

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,360
time ago

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,400
um about you know video

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,880
usage and you know if they watch two

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,120
minutes you're lucky um

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,640
unfortunately and so yes we have you

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,480
know we have 30 minute videos that we

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,559
have on our website of all these

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,600
events i found actually though that

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,679
people will

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,760
they we do a podcast that we record

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,679
right after we do the meetups now

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,320
with those same speakers and those

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,320
podcasts get more traffic than

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,520
the videos because people are willing to

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,240
listen to

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,120
the podcasts before they're willing to

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,400
watch the video

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,039
afterwards just fyi

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,240
from our matrix i also have like two

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,600
things to say about that

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,880
um is i've noticed that if you um

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,120
market the on-demands uh with a somewhat

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,039
tried and true email method system and i

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,640
know this sounds super marketing

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:15,840
kind of kung fu but if you do a

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,240
a plan and then a fear email where it's

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,400
like

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,320
hey this is available for you for the

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,720
next nine months and then you follow up

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,120
with an email series that says hey

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,840
you only have nine months six months

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,960
three months

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,039
two weeks uh to engage with this content

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,880
a lot of times setting that deadline

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,760
will encourage them to engage a little

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,320
bit more

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,799
but i think that aaron is right um i'm

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,159
sorry

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,400
i it says but um

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,480
i think he's right you should probably

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,039
also look at splintering your on-demand

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,200
content

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,720
into other mediums that people are more

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,320
willing to

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,440
uh watch or listen to over time and also

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,559
it's a great way to

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,559
gain content for a later community

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,080
generation

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,240
i think one of the things that zeke week

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,880
did really well was to integrate

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,080
slack in with the conference in real

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,880
time so that

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,240
there were very short talks with no q a

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,159
and the idea was that like

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
go meet the presenter in slack so it

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,279
drove people into that community very

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,440
quickly and it made it a more

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,000
interactive session so to address kind

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,000
of the zoom

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,840
fatigue and you know do i just want to

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,919
sit here and watch hours of talks

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,760
uh i i have a very short amount of time

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,880
to to listen to a topic and say oh that

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,559
sounds really interesting wait i don't

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,039
understand this or what about this

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,480
let me go there's already a conversation

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,200
already happening

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,080
in slack uh and then that can continue

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,679
beyond

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,320
uh the the event itself um so i think

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,000
that went

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,640
extremely well i think that went better

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,919
than than we could have ever anticipated

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,120
this that's really smart because i

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,080
inevitably we always get the requests um

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,200
of the chat for we have to use webex

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,240
because

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,279
it's needed for the the banks that's the

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,320
one that they normally

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:04,480
allow you to get through with um but you

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,279
know the webex chat is

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,919
probably the most requested thing out of

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,039
um

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,640
our our talks now um and

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,320
because you know i mean and that means

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,559
that there's good discussion

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,400
um definitely but but i like the idea of

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,320
throwing that into slack so that it can

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,760
be

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,360
i don't want to say ever or a little

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,279
more evergreen but that

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,000
you can we we also take the slides of

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,279
the presenter

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,480
and put them on linkedin um with

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,960
the idea that people could continue the

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,400
chat

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,679
there that hasn't really come to

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,559
you know we've gotten some likes and

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,840
everything but but for the most part

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,600
i think you're right and i mean my

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,360
slack's going crazy right now

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,960
while i'm trying to speak of course but

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,799
um but

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,320
i think that if we would throw that into

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,480
slack and then have something that they

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,480
can continue to engage afterwards

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,880
um that would be awesome so thanks for

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,799
that idea

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,480
i really like that idea yeah uh just

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,600
cta-ing them to

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,200
somewhat longer form content yeah and i

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,840
think one of the things that went really

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,400
well

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,760
uh that so i have i've i've had the

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,279
privilege of doing this a few times a

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,039
few different conferences and each one

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,679
shows a different technology

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,400
so if i can geek out for a moment one of

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,799
the things

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,000
that that i've seen work best is you

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,600
know use

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,200
uh whatever you have to use so if it's

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,279
webex if it's zoom if it's

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:32,000
uh go to meeting uh whatever it might be

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,520
for your presenters but then make it as

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,799
easy as possible

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,799
for the attendees to join and so by

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,640
for example streaming to youtube it

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,720
wasn't it wasn't a oh i can't

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,480
you know i'm not allowed to install zoom

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,960
uh or don't have permissions or you know

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,640
it's

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,400
not a policy thing just like you just

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,840
click and watch youtube and

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,919
there's there's a live stream right

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,279
there so the attendees were

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,880
there's there's no barrier uh to to

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,240
listing it on the talk now presenters

00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,279
obviously we want to have more control

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,320
and be able to screen share and do all

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,960
those other things

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,799
so like for them uh having some some

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,240
more acceptable solution whatever works

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,600
for you uh

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,279
you know you'll need but but for the

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,240
attendees don't force them to use the

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,799
same platform

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,480
as the presenters it's frankly it's it's

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,279
really not necessary especially once you

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,279
communicate

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,480
once you separate the the kind of q a

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,440
and communication

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,159
from the actual delivery of the of the

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,559
talk itself

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,279
we're in a regulated industry so youtube

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,720
and like

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,120
google docs and everything is is so that

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,840
that's

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,159
you know we'd love to do that um but but

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,360
yeah i get what you're saying um

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,559
and then and corey i just saw your

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,000
question um so

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,919
we we just had a huge huge

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,520
project announcement open source project

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,559
announcement this morning from goldman

currently running or at the same time

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,600
running

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:08,799
um through a it's a financial regulator

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,840

this week

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:17,279

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,320
the um the thing is called but

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,399
but basically it's cryptocurrency um

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,919
how to use cryptocurrency and how to

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,200
fight against cryptocurrency this is

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,399
being used in

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:32,000
uh children sex trafficking um

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:36,720
and so we're we're running a hackathon

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,840
on that right now with air um

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,600
uh using but they are using zoom

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,000
um so i can't be on i'm on my phone for

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,039
that one

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,240
i'm on my laptop for this one um

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,240
but but what we're we're we're trying to

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,900
navigate the hackathon part

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,240
um right now and so

00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,760
[Music]

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,279
if we get anything out of that um

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,600
you know and and i'd like to see how

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,679
many attendees we have right now

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,039
for that hackathon um but if we get

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,640
anything out of it i will definitely

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,080
relay it over to you

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,440
um uh but this is the

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,000
this is new for us right now also yeah

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,799
and i might also interject to kind of

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,159
add to that

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,520
uh corey i actually have a resource um

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,039
that i definitely recommend called

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,320
virtual teams that work it's actually

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,080
like this big uh

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,000
case study book of a bunch of peer

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,520
review uh articles

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,279
and i find that it's really really

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,399
helpful for the transition

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,240
of ritual content events into virtual

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,760
formats because they work very very

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,039
similar to

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,919
active virtual teams

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,000
well i'm also going to add and i sent a

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,480
private message to corey when she posted

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,080
it

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,559
but there's a guy named raleigh named

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,279
frank jones um he runs the raleigh seo

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,200
meetup

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,520
he actually does it on discord but i

00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,799
would say about two-thirds of his

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,559
um following and members um are involved

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,760
in a lot of hackathons for different

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,840
things

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,240
and they i believe they get together

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,919
underscored every tuesday night

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,640
and i don't have access to the um

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,360
uh to the invite here but if you go to

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,640
the raleigh seo meetup on meetup.com you

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,840
can join it

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,039
and then the invite link is there

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,360
and i can i'm going to post my email

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,360
address publicly in your chat

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,760
and if you shoot me an email i can

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,799
forward you his last email to it

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,760
but his group there's probably 15 of

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,679
them

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,760
they can probably provide advice in that

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,919
space because a lot of them are involved

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,559
with that stuff

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,720
and and to echo eugene discord is is a

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,399
fantastic tool i actually was

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,799
very much opposed to it a few months ago

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,159
and uh uh def con which is one of the

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,559
largest security conferences in the

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,440
world

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,159
if not the uh hosted their virtual

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,120
conference

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,919
in in discord and i was floored to see

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,320
how well

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,519
it handled um it allowed for screen

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,840
sharing it allowed for

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,120
you know the quick formation of rooms

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,440
for uh for

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,120
moderation from the organizers while at

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,320
the same time having freedom for the

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,240
participants

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,000
to you know self-organize so for

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,120
something like a hackathon

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,799
something like discord where you can

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,320
have you know just some some rooms that

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,760
people can just kind of jump in

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,200
and work on their project and screen you

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,559
know you can have multiple screen shares

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,120
going you can have your cameras on or

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,760
off

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,679
um it worked beautifully and i've said

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,720
i've honestly done a total 180 on

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,760
discord

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,600
so for free tool uh it's it's fantastic

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,240
it's a very low barrier to entry a lot

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,440
of

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,760
younger folks i think are already

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,840
familiar with it anyway

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,399
and for a hackathon setting i think it'd

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,840
be fantastic

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,880
i'm in like 20 discords now it's it it

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,640
it catches up with you very quickly

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,240
i used to use it the other thing that

00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,000
aaron does

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,640
oh i'm sorry go ahead oh i'm done it was

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,760
an aside

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,799
i i use discord a lot or just yeah i use

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,880
discourse

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,720
discord both of them are wonderful

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,039
platforms but i use discord a lot for

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,919
dnd sessions and it's incredibly handy

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,840
for

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,840
uh working with other people

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,360
the the other thing aaron does really

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,080
well that is not

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,360
a hackathon but it is a hands-on kind of

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,200
like multiple people where you need

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,159
multiple rooms that kind of savann runs

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,360
a

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,960
a ctf for both um our our corporate

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,679
organization and our community

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,240
and um and now with with some of the

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,360
zoom

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,200
um when you upgrade when people can move

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,200
between breakout sessions and stuff

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,600
it makes it super easy to set up a whole

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,840
bunch of breakouts and let people move

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,760
in

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,840
in between those breakouts too so

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,919
depending on what tools you already have

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,960
if you don't want to go out and invest

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,720
engineering debt

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,240
or you know that tech debt setting

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,240
something up and learning something new

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,000
and you already have a tool then that it

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,480
might be

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,120
uh just upgrading your license for the

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,039
for the

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,240
meeting side to hold more people and

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,159
have more breakout rooms

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,080
so and and aaron run some very

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,840
successful and often large

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,480
ctfs um in that format in that format

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,080
as well one of the questions that came

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,600
up was about tooling

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,519
um let's see where did it go

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,039
questions we haven't hit yet what are

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,480
the recommended tools

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,480
what's a good way to determine the level

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,840
of interest in the event so

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,679
i was going to post this little

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,200
checklist that i have

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,880
um and i'll and i'll post it later too

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,240
in the google doc let me see if i can

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,360
post it here so

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,039
um one of the things that that

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,559
i try to do for every event it doesn't

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,279
matter how big or small is one surveyed

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,120
the community

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,640
you map out the community and find your

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,600
you know your influencers your

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,120
we are talking about the mission

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,440
statement what the content is and then

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,279
what your budget is

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,799
sometimes you can do big events i've

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,480
done you know

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,640
four thousand per people in person

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,159
events on a twenty five hundred dollar

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,799
budget but that took a lot of work

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,760
um you know your day in location and

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,120
then finally

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,880
it's your marketing piece you gotta have

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,359
all your other pieces in place to do

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,240
marketing so we're talking dungeons and

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,079
dragons

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,960
um so um so it just depends on

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,280
like one what what your budget is and

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,760
how

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,359
how much you can spend on your tools or

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,679
do you find out that

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,919
you know what we could we only have five

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,200
grand to do everything with and so what

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,720
do you what are you gonna use it all

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,520
depends a lot of times on

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,839
how much budget do you have you know to

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,359
find your tools and your location or you

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,079
know what or if it's in

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,200
you know virtual you know what do you

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,399
already have

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,240
and how much are people going to let you

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,480
spend so i don't know any other thoughts

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,480
about

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,919
those right tools and where you pull the

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,000
trigger on different things

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,679
one of my favorite tools and this kind

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,960
of also gets to another question that

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,919
was on the google doc that we haven't

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,640
quite gotten to

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,599
is how do you gauge interest in people's

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,119
um

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,280
in people who are interested in your

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,800
event prior to your event actually

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,599
happening

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,560
and one of my favorite tools i uh

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:14,320
discovered this in 2019

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,359
at cmx the community

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,800
leadership summit for cmx

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,920
and uh it's by happily.io and it's

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,800
a roi calculator that i've included in

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,920
vset

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,960
and a portion of that calculator is um

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,720
after the event but at least beforehand

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,240
you can say okay so these are the

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,480
integers these are the key

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,839
performance indicators that i need to be

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,320
tracking regularly

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,359
in order to get an estimated amount of

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,440
uh cost

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,599
and it boils it down to really simple uh

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,040
if you're not getting a four times roi

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,640
as a result of the calculator um then

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,880
it might not be worth running your

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,599
virtual event at the same time there's

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
that

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,760
aspect of quality greater than uh

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,680
quantity

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,680
so that's an incredibly useful tool

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,280
i had no i had heard of it but i haven't

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,359
played around with it

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,400
sorry i was just gonna say i was the one

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,640
who asked that question

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,839
or ask that question in the document

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,960
regarding the

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,240
you know roi um because it's one of

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,160
those where when you uh

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,599
go to host an event it's it's

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,680
determining how many people actually

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,480
want to participate in the event

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,200
um and sometimes that's really hard to

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,359
gauge

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,880
um you know because it seems like some

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,680
people could be really interested in an

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,280
event

00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,200
and then when you actually have the

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,599
event only like three people show up

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,240
you're

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,440
so it's like okay what are what you know

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,760
what am i doing wrong

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,640
or is it you know how how am i

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,000
misjudging

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,560
the audience in such a way that like i

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,880
the the roi becomes negative for every

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,359
event and that's just not sustainable so

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,119
you know it's one of those tricky kind

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,880
of things where you want people to come

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,560
to an event but you also don't want to

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,079
be pushy and send a whole bunch of

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,359
emails and

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,680
notifications and stuff so

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,359
mike do you find i mean do you do

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,079
registration for your event first of all

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,480
um so we uh so i have done registration

00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,839
uh

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,160
uh once before um it was basically uh

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,040
by the event that i was trying to put

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,240
together uh

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,800
and i did uh successfully once was

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,359
based off of the meetup group um and so

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,520
it was

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,560
more of the uh you know the people who

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,720
were in the meet up

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,760
and communicating with that group of

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,520
people about the

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,320
you know about the event that was

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,800
outside the meetup and then

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,599
you know the the level of interest

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,320
seemed high

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,880
and then the level of attendance uh was

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,920
uh

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,320
shockingly low so um either people

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,280
really

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,880
don't like me or um it just they just

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,400
didn't really want to go

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,079
um so you know i'm hoping that it's the

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,599
latter and not the former

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,000
but you know i mean it will be

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,839
i think one of the biggest oh sorry i

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,680
didn't mean to interrupt but

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,760
things that you should do is you should

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,320
do some funnel optimization

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,960
so uh figure out what's going on in your

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,640
funnel

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,560
and where people are dropping off

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:24,800
and i was going to say that um with

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:27,359
with the meetups that we've done we

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,000
is that the one we require registration

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,200
um

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,880
just so that so we could get an

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,040
idea of who might be interested and

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,400
that's our way of gauging interest

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,599
um however

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,280
i don't ever announce the the full event

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,560
until the day before

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,839
um and because it is one thing to

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,320
promote an event for months on end and

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,079
get

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,520
you know plenty of interest in it but

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,880
but i think what you're talking about

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,079
mike is that it's

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,240
it's another thing to actually have

00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,680
somebody show up and

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,359
and i've been getting a lot of things

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,240
from like hubspot and and

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,680
other places that i follow that you know

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,839
they're like

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,440
you can promote it all you want but in

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,200
unless those people

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,839
know and remember on the day of or the

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,040
day before that they're supposed to be

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,200
someplace um

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,640
then they just won't you know they won't

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,119
show up um

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,920
people don't read unfortunately people

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,160
don't

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,680
remember and and then when it's when

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,480
there's

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,760
uh back to aaron's point about if

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,400
there's going to be a recording

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,680
anyway why do i care you know i can just

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,720
come back to or i think i'm going to

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,599
come back to it

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,640
um but you know because it's virtual

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,359
because

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,000
you know that like when when todd and i

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,200
were doing

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,320
um uh poscon uh ten

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,240
something years ago um our biggest

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,359
problem was with students we let them in

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,720
for free

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,839
and they would either you know register

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,599
and we'd look like we had these

00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,240
incredible numbers and they'd not show

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,880
up

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,640
or they'd just you know come in and

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,040
steal all the swag from the sponsors and

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,400
then

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,040
you know go away um but once we

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,560
actually you know made them pay 10 bucks

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,000
for the event

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,040
we saw the right number of attendees

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,240
come in and so

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:21,119
so sometimes the registration

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,200
so that you can send them something that

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,040
says hey don't forget you know there

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,640
we send out the mass email saying

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,079
there's an event tomorrow but we send a

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,319
reminder email about

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,760
an hour and a half before the event

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,800
saying don't forget you said you were

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,000
going to come to this

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,200
um with with a calendar invite too

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,160
um you know give give them every

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,079
you know chance not to mess it up

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,560
unfortunately and it may feel like

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,599
you're

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,560
you're over communicating to them um

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,960
but i i after working with todd lewis

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,520
for

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,280
a long time i can tell you he's the king

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,400
of over communication

00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,760
in a good way um and and people show up

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,560
because he continues to over communicate

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,400
and

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,160
and when it feels like it's too much

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,119
when there's so much

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,280
noise coming through you know chat

00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,920
through email through everything else

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,440
sometimes you just you kind of have to

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,480
be pushy otherwise they're not going to

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,839
come to your event

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,760
and it's not you and i'll i'll echo team

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,720
aaron very quickly

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,240
uh if you but more emails not less

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,119
calendar invites are big

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,319
uh so i've run about 50 different these

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,920
capture the flag events

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,680
and i've noticed kind of a little bit of

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,680
a b testing as we added calendar

00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,760
invites like people add it to their

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,200
calendar and they remember that's huge

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,480
um i have included like an rsvp link

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,680
just to say like hey just want to make

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,880
sure you're going to come click here to

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,920
claim your c

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,400
so that gives them a little bit of

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,800
urgency to it but it also gives me

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,400
a click of trackable link that i can say

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,839
like all right i know they saw this

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,480
email they clicked on it they acted on

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,160
it

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,160
so i'll say you know click to claim your

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,480
seat add this to your calendar

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,720
and then join us on these dates and then

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,400
the last thing that i would add to that

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,319
um and i think amber's done a great job

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,359
this is finding a way to make it

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:11,760
make incentivize the live event

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,960
so give a prize away potentially if

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
there's if there's some competitive

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,319
aspect or

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,079
you know even just a raffle something uh

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,119
to say like oh well i should be there

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,560
for that or

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,480
make it so that you could you're really

00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,079
going to only be able to ask questions

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,760
if you show up to the live event and of

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,440
course we want to ask questions

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,800
so whatever you can do to incentivize

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,920
them to be there

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,160
um at that time um i think really does

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,160
help

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,240
and we're just gonna go for a couple

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,520
more minutes since we got got a late

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
start the other thing i was going to say

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,920
was never

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,000
never take it personal because as a kind

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,079
of a rule of thumb when

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
it comes to online events and in-person

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:51,280
events um especially

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,119
online free just if you've got a hundred

00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,079
people registered just assume 50 are

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,400
gonna show up like

00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,359
that fifty percent attrition rate is

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,880
pretty standard

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,920
for online free events um now when you

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,280
when people

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,119
you know have to register and there's

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,720
just a little bit of skin in the game

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,760
like whether it's that ten dollars or

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,839
whether it's some

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,319
you know little fee that that's

00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,359
associated that somebody has to pay or

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,000
or uh you know put into it then that's

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,079
usually

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,319
about a 30 attrition rate because some

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,319
people can go i can afford to lose that

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,000
amount of money because it's not like a

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,400
you know 2600

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,480
registration fee but you still see

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,720
attrition even with those larger

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,000
numbers so figure like when you look at

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,400
the numbers for in-person

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,520
attrition versus online attrition always

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,400
just the you know

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,480
assume fifty percent of your permission

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,680
for an online free event um and then if

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,280
you get more than that then you're

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,880
happily um surprised um we've got about

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,560
two minutes before you

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,359
call this uh done um and we move on to

00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,720
like the next

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:57,359
um the next talk but um

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,280
is there anything else that you'd like

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,880
or questions that we should put answers

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,319
to in the google doc that maybe we

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,160
haven't gotten to yet

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,599
please put those in there and we'll do

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,480
our best to answer them before the end

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,359
of the day

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,000
um and get that uh get that taken care

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,520
of

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,960
uh is there anything that we haven't

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,480
touched on or something that you thought

00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,599
we were going to touch on that you

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,400
um that we didn't um that we

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,839
that we can ask here and then follow up

00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,839
in the google

00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,119
no so but if there is

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,560
i feel like there's so much more like i

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,760
just put that short checklist in there

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,720
the other thing that i'll include in the

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,680
google

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,880
doc is a master event tracker so one of

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,359
the things that people

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,920
often don't do is have a spreadsheet

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,920
that's got

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,520
all your revenue coming in all your

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,200
costs to include t and e for your

00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,920
project

00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,319
breaking down your registration by type

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,000
and

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,760
how much each type cost and then what

00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,960
have you got coming in

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,920
and then also tracking your sponsors on

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,920
another sheet

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,440
tracking your shipping it seems like a

00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,480
lot of detail but tracking that shipment

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,319
for all your sponsors

00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,920
what your sponsors ordered what what

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,440
they actually got delivered

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,680
all of those type of things affect your

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,480
bottom line and your budget so making

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,760
sure that

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,480
um you do have a great master event

00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,880
tracker

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,400
um and i'll include i'll try to clear

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,680
out one that i think is really good

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,520
and and drop a link to a blank one um

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,359
on the google doc if i don't get it done

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,200

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,640
everybody has it

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,880
and i'll also put that other checklist

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,319
in there and all the questions that

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,240
um you kind of need to go over when

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:43,599
you're planning either of

00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,520
in person or um an online event

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,200
you know who you're meeting with your

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,119
stakeholders collaborating coming up

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,760
with a plan and then executing to that

00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,200
plan

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,040
a lot of people come up with a plan then

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,960
they change the plan halfway through

00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,040
and then wonder how come things didn't

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,079
go um as you would expected because

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,280
there was too many

00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,400
changes in flight so um but we'll

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,800

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,160
as well and then we'll also include

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,880

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,480
in

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:13,599

00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,400
