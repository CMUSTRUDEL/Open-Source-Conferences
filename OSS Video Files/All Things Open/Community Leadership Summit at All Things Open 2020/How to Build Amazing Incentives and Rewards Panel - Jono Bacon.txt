Abstract: We know that human beings are motivated by incentives and rewards such as recognition, swag, and more, but how do we do it well? In this session we want to share and explore incentives and rewards that work and donâ€™t work, and explore new and interesting ways to encourage active community participation. There is so much to discuss here, so be sure to come and join the session!â€‹

	00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,600
so what i'd like to kind of explore in

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,719
this session

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,920
is is how we do incentives well

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,640
in communities so my philosophy for many

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,080
years has been that

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,160
people join communities for a reason

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,480
they don't join communities

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,680
um because they haven't got anything

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,840
else to do

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,279
they join for a reason and it could be

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,679
to solve their problems it could be to

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,519
meet people to get mentoring

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,800
um but when you join a community style

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,360
as a casual member

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,800
you don't really know anyone and then as

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,399
you participate more you become a

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,600
regular member and you start showing up

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,840
every day

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,879
and oh hang on request ed request edit

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,399

thank you lisa all right reload everyone

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,880
sorry

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,720
it turns out i don't know how to use

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,159
google docs

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,240
i'll add that to the litany of other

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,520
things that i don't know how to use

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,720
um um

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,159
so aaron uh there is there is ambergrain

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,960
the session is on the other track which

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,840
is about running

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,280
events so just again just as a recap for

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,920
folks who are joining

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,720
who are joining this session right now

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,159
uh the

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,799
the event session which amber is going

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,040
to be coordinating is on the other track

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,920
okay so um so when people join

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
communities i

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,640
i'm of the view that they they start out

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,240
as casual members then they become

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,439
regulars they start becoming very active

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,280
and then and then a small number of

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,680
people will become super active

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,439
very very enthusiastic um core members

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,280
of the community

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,680
and incentives are a great way of moving

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,640
people through that journey

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,119
you know because i think we're all

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,799
fundamentally incentivized like

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,159
you know for example we collect airline

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,759
miles or

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,679
back when we could go to coffee shops

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,039
we'd get coffee card

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,120
you know coffee cards and you get them

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,720
stamped when you got 10 coffees

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
you'd be able to get a free coffee and

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,040
all kinds of different things

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,640
so those kinds of incentives i think are

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,200
a really interesting way of saying okay

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,480
here's a reason to come and participate

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,000
and to trigger the right kind of

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,280
behavioral patterns that i think we want

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
to see in communities whether it's

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,120
mentoring or collaboration or

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,680
building software or whatever else but

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,760
what should those incentives look like

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
and that's kind of what i'd love to dig

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,360
into in this session

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,800
so maybe we can start out with

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,239
one question for everybody and you can

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,160
put it into the chat or you can share

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,560
here as well

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,560
what kinds of incentives and rewards

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,519
have you seen that have really resonated

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,680
with you

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
you know that when you when you've seen

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,080
them in action whether it's swag that

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
people get

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,640
or recognition what have you seen and

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,920

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,319
say thank you

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,840
um and doing that publicly and

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,319
acknowledging them is amazing

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,360

so why don't we dig into that a little

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,400
while like a little bit

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,920
what do you think are the most critical

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,760
elements of recognition

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,879
as a group and again just to remind

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,199

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,400

as you as a panelist so you can come and

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,240
chat with us as well

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,199
but what what recognition would you all

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,440
recommend

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
because i can share things that i found

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,199
to that work well but

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,600
um what would you what would you

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,360
recommend

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,759
i think simple know in in my case i was

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
trying to think and just having my name

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
you know associated to

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
a release of a software or something

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,080
like you know in the release note or

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,080
like yeah

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,360
those were the people that contributed

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,680
to producing

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,440
this thing so it can be a software or a

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,440
blog post or whatever

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,080
i think just having the name kind of

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,000
i think it kind of please everyone's ego

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
a bit you know say oh yeah i did this

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,880
great thing and it's

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,320
it's there now it's online for everyone

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,400
to show you can share with your friends

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,520
or your family and say oh yeah

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,440
i did that so yeah and

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,919
it's not necessarily something that you

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,800
get every day from your day-to-day job

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,320
because it's much more like if you work

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
in a company that is

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,560
more like closed then you know it stays

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,280
within your

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
job or day-to-day circle of activities

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,520
where

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,680
if you do it in an open open project

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,919
it's suddenly shared with the world so i

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,039
think that's maybe the change of

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,600
of audience that you can you can share

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,880
your

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,199
accomplishment with but it's a big

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,160
a big part into into this recognition

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,759
aspect

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,759
yeah hey can i ask a favor this is a

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,120
another building the car as we're going

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,199
lisa murray can you

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,400
um facilitate for a few minutes because

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
it turns out that people are not able to

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,720
find amber's session i just want to make

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
sure that everybody knows where a

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,120
session is i'm gonna

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,160
ask the ato folks is that okay

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,680
absolutely no problem um and i'll start

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,479
this thing one of the recognition things

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,319
that we

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,520
do at cockroach uh there's actually a

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,919
slack channel for it

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,360
and and you can do it anonymously which

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,160
a lot of people are kind of embarrassed

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
so you have to

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,960
you know understand you've got

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,360
introverts in your community and you

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,160
have to give people a way to anonymously

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,880
um acknowledge people so we have this i

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
think it's just

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,160
on slack if you just go like backslash

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,240
ack

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,840
ack then it posts it publicly but it

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,600
posts it anonymously

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,120
and then um we also have this little

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,960
competition where if you write a poem

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,160
the cto will actually read it out loud

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
during the all hands

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,080
so like a haiku you know a really short

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,880
thing and then we put the cto on the

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,639
spot

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,800
and then sometimes people even sing them

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,599
it's uh it's just really creative ways

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,280
that you do it

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,960
but i think the anonymous part is is

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,479
something if you can build that into the

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,080
code where you're acknowledging people i

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,840
think you'll get a lot more people

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,840
acknowledging people

uh we have at our company we have kudo

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,360
um you can you know write thank you note

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,599
to anyone

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,519
and then put it in a box and then it's

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,800
distributed to that person

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,200
and it's also uh taking a picture and

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,800
then it's like on the on the internet

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,440
it's published

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,720
and now everybody's working from home

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,680
you can do the same thing

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,880
with online kudo cards and so it turns

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,440
out you know that's a

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,360
really small thing but people like it

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,800
people really like it

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,360
yeah we have added another thing

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,240
and that is a it's a little stuffed

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,959
animal

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,080
it's a little really it's a monster from

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,680
a kid's

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,160
movie i guess and um you wouldn't

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,720
believe what it does to people to adults

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,440
right

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,440
i mean we have like two or three of

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,680
these circulating in the company

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
and uh instead of you know writing a

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,760
kudu card which is fine

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,040
but you can take that to a person you go

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,120
to their office

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,040
and you give it to them say really i

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,760
want to say thank you for this and that

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,680
and blah

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,800
and adults grown people right their face

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,839
lightens up and they're just all wow so

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,360
that works

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,519
and another thing i would like to add

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,839
uh to jonah what you said you know like

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,959
little things and stuff

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,160
uh so i'm a diver you you can tell from

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,800
my background

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,600
i just today in the mail received this

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,959
here

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,959
uh can you see this now no

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:13,040
no so it's a a five-year membership

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,279
uh from uh achievement award from

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,480
from paddy you know diving organization

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,399
and see i haven't even

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,600
unpacked it yet a little button

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,320
five-year member

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,120
and that just receiving this edits it

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,360
you know it's

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,120
not much but just receiving this in the

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,240
mail made me really happy i'm like wow

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,680
that's cool so community work works

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,800
really well at this point right

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,360
so um one thank you for that wolfgang

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,760
one

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,399
one comment that andy just made in the

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,480
in the

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
chat is that i talked about submarine

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,560
incentives early this morning

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,000
about how to encourage behavior uh and

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
andy said

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,760
uh for me to talk a little bit about

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,920
that so just briefly

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,360
the idea of this is that the way i kind

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,040
of look at it is that there's two ways

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,120
of incentivizing people i call them

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,800
stated and submarine incentives

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,800
so a stated incentive is where you say

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,959
if you do this thing you get this thing

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,560
so for example if you achieve a

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,600
particular goal in a video game you get

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,399
a trophy

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,519
or if you get your question liked by a

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,600
certain number of people on stack

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,279
overflow then you get a badge

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,959
and it can even be if you participate in

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,839
a competition and you win you get the

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,079
prize

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,800
so the expectations are very clearly

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,800
laid up front

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,600
the submarine incentive is where you

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,000
basically use computers to detect when

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,560
something

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,800
happens and then use a human being

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,240
to recognize what happens so this kind

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,920
of again gets in line with what a lot of

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,680
people are saying here around

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,360
recognition being so important so the

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,040
example i often give is

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,560
when i'm working with various companies

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,839
especially if we use discourse which is

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,600
a forum platform

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,920
they've got these trust models built

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,440
into discourse and the idea is that

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,959
you know trust level zero is which is

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,800
when you register a new account they

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,320
don't know if you're a spammer or not

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,800
so the more you read and participate

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
responsibly you've got trust level one

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,360
and then you go up to trust level two

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,000
and then you go to trust level three and

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,160
there's four different trust levels

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,600
and what i think is so cool about that

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,760
is that the platform

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
determines what active participation

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,560
looks like and it's not just reading

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,079
it's not just writing

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,680
it's a combination of reading writing

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,000
filling in your profile having things

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,680
like

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,600
you liking things but then you can tie

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,120
human output to those different levels

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
so when someone hits trust level 2 for

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,519
example

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
i always recommend to my clients and

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,360
communities um

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,880
you share you know just recognize that

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,480
person publicly on the forum

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,560
um and just say you know we love the

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,399
work that's kind of going on here

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,680
you know that you've been doing and you

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,880
know you talk about them a little bit

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,000
and you check with them first to make

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,120
sure if they want to

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
if you put their picture up that they're

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,279
going to be comfortable with it for

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,040
example but

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,040
it delivers this sense of surprise and

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,279
delight and that's what i love about it

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,279
opensource.com do something very similar

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,480
for example where when people have at

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,600
least they used to i don't know if they

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,360
still do it but when the people would

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,639
hit certain levels of contribution in

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,160
opensource.com

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,639
you would just receive something in the

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,639
mail or you would get invited to go out

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,240
to raleigh to go to all things open

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,320
and then join the red hat team for a set

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,079
of discussions and

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,360
it wasn't that they said if you write 10

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,720
articles we'll send you a branded

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,639
bluetooth speaker

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,320
it just happened out of surprise so they

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,839
were tracking it as a submarine

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,519
incentive and i just

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,040
i just so oh raymond says that they're

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,160
still doing it i just think that's so

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,240
amazing

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,160
um because you get like bruce says you

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,399
get that sense of surprise

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,920
um so i i don't want to shield my book

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,560
but i write about some people powered

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,040
and um

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,320
i think it's to me submarine we often

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,959
talk about if you do this thing you get

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,399
this swag

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,920
to me it's the submarine incentives are

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,920
really exciting i think so

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,240
any other methods of distributing

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,040
incentives that anyone

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,040
anyone wants to share

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,360
i would like to share some ideas from my

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,560
side

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,880
uh so for me joining a community and the

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,399
incentives behind joining a community is

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,519
that you meet

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,839
the people of diverse cultures and so

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,720
everybody is contributing their ideas

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,360
and beliefs

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,360
and how they work in their cultures so

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,519
you get to know the diverse perspectives

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,120
and then you get to align that okay what

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,320
is happening in this world and what is

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,000
happening in our world

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,760
and then you get try to conclude okay

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,680
what is the best thing which could be

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,959
really good for the society

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,600
so uh this helps to build uh

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,199
build a new society or the new culture

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,760
which is actually good for

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,120
everybody so that is what my idea is

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,920
when i joined the

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,160
any community yeah wonderful thank you

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,440
um just a couple of comments from the

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,000
chats to make sure that everyone in the

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,199
chat feels included here as well

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,880
um so tamayo um

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,639
also says about building surprising

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,240
delight systematically into into the

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,720
programs i'm assuming this is that we've

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,040
worked

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,160
tomorrow um but also probably devrelcon

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,440
as well

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,920
um uh joe says

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,360
in a past job we had spot bonuses you

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,480
could nominate someone for a spot bonus

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,000
and your nomination

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,920
will be posted on a special slack

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
channel recognition and money reward

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,600
which i think is kind of interesting

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,519
that actually reminds me briefly that

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,120
when i was at x prize

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,720
i forget what platform it was but there

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
was a thing where every month employers

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,199
got 50 bucks

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,480
and you could spend it on rewarding your

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,120
your colleagues

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,480
so um if you did some work with somebody

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,160
and they did an amazing job you could

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,279
give them five dollars or ten dollars or

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,199
whatever

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,959
um and it was a relatively small company

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,800
it's about 100 people

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,880
but what was really cool about it is

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,079
that all the executives and the senior

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,320
leaders always got

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,440
the credit for everything but the people

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,920
who consistently

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,199
earned the the donations or the the

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,079
money from that 50

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,279
um fund for each person were the people

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,480
who worked in the front desk

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,320
it was everybody was taking the phone

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,519
calls and shipping out packages

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,839
and i thought it was just a really

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,240
interesting way of identifying

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,839
where a lot of appreciation was and then

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,639
of course they could spend that money on

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
buying

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,240
whatever gift cards or whatever they

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,079
could read they could redeem it so

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,480
i just think it was a really neat way of

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,040
doing that

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,639
yeah we we do have that at haddad yeah

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,839
we have like it works by

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,639
like quarters but we people are

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,040
encouraged to recognize the values that

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,480
the

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,720
the company um uh value

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,759
and so you can you can actually say oh

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,560
yeah thank you for

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,959
for demonstrating this behavior that

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,360
aligns to the company values so i think

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,079
yeah

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,959
that's a great way to do it so just a

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,240
quick reminder

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,320
just be sorry just before we go on

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,600
because tomorrow just mentioned this um

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,199
uh to me i'm happy to make you a

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
panelist if you'd like to i'd love to

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,759
have you come and join

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,000
and anyone else anyone else who wants to

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,279
come and join as a as a panelist and

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,199
you can you don't have to switch your

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,440
video camera on if you don't want to but

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,480
um audio is totally fine but just let me

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,759
know in the chat

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,279
if you want me to add you and i can go

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,480
and add you right away everyone so i

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,920
want everybody to feel like they can

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,720
join us

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,480
definitely at mayo um so one thing about

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,240
that acknowledgement that we found

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,079
is some teams were better at doing it

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,000
than others the engineers are really

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,919
good at acknowledging each other's work

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,839
the marketing teams were not and maybe

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,039
marketing can be such a thankless job

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,880
you're just sort of used to doing it

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,120
without getting people saying thank you

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,880
so what they initiated there is for the

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,640
all hands team marketing meeting

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,720
we start off the meeting by having by

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,760
saying one thing that you're proud of of

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,120
yourself

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,959
and then one thing that you're proud of

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,240
of somebody else so every week like what

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,919
are you most proud of

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,520
and forcing people to do that because

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,319
people are very uncomfortable talking

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,240
about themselves

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,679
but it really elevated a lot of the work

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
that people were doing that nobody knew

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,360
about

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,200
and i thought it was a really good

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
tactic to start the meeting with so if

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,360
you can do that on your online

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
communities as well

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,200
one thing you're proud of that you've

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,480
done this week i love that

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,280
yeah i love that that's awesome

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,720
so i'm adding uh so tomasen here and rey

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,080
is joining

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,640
there he is perfect hi tamira we've got

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,840
brand new panelists do you want to share

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,880
in tomorrow do you know

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,360
do you want to go first and share

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,679
anything um i guess i'll

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,799
follow up with the um sort of the

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,039
surprise and delight

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,400
um because in the teams that i've built

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,919
and the programs that i built especially

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,200
around champions programs

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,880
um it's often a challenge to

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,039
uh i don't know if you've heard of terms

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,799
like they use it in theater so it's like

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,559
this thing where actors practice and

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,520
practice and practice to the point that

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,720
it appears as if it was all improvised

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,640
and in the moment but there's

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,160
all this that went into it you know all

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,440
this practice and preparation

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,039
and so i think there's a lot of times

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,640
people who don't understand what we do

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,000
in deveral and community stuff

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,360
where when they see the surprise and

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,120
they light delight they think it was

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,520
just oh it's just this fluke this sort

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
of

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,600
silly thing that you threw out there

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,320
when it's like completely

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,080
systematically built into our strategy

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,760
and how we want to brand ourselves and

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,240
how we want to present ourselves

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,760
and often can come into conflict and

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,520
friction with you know core

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,840
enterprise branding because they're like

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,360
oh like we don't want that mascot

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,799
associated with what we're doing so i

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,080
mean i would just love

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,720
to hear how people are like

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,320
doing the same thing maybe what how they

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,640
dealt with some challenges

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,880
um not to overtake but i would love yeah

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,880
that sounds great any thoughts anyone

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,559
and anyone in the chat as well is

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,559
welcome to

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,080
to feeding in

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,240
i guess i would also add that like you

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,960
know it depends on the company culture

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,200
that you're in

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,360
like github is obviously this great

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,600
example we keep bringing up because

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,520
it appears the corporate culture itself

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,960
obviously supported the octocat and

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,000
supported sort of the ways that they

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,559
engaged so

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,520
i don't know what kinds of um working

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,200
cultures people

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,039
were able to work in where it was

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,039
flexible or if it was inflexible

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,120
yeah any thoughts anyone i don't know

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,919
one of the things i added was

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,120
that sometimes just giving people

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,280
flexibility

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:06,480
or time off or ability to kind of go

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,120
work on side projects is is itself

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,919
a huge reward um i have someone on my

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,360
team

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,520
who loves it when she gets to work on a

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,440
variety of different things so

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,280
you know giving her an opportunity to

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,080
kind of feel the joy of

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,640
working on things that she wants to is

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,760
is

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,039
is a reward in itself yeah

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,880
so we've got a couple of comments in the

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,240
chat just to share as well so

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,760
katie says different people of different

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,400
types of motivators

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,000
um stated incentives often have a

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,760
perceived monetary value

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,440
where other unstated incentives often

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,880
have emotional value what is the best

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,840
way to combine

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,120
these for volunteers to increase

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,720
contributions uh stated incentives often

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,080
turn people off if they don't have an

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,679
interest in it

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,280
we need to draw in volunteers without

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,559
showing stated incentives that won't

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,280
hold interest and i

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,080
just uh i think we should dig into this

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,919
a little bit because i think it's a

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,760
really interesting point katie

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,440
um one thing i've just noticed as a data

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,440
point is that

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,200
only if you look at video games for

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,480
example only some people collect

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,120
trophies which are

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,159
definitions of stated incentives i would

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,640
argue

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,159
not everybody is a natural collector um

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,120
they don't collect badges and stack

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,799
exchange and

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,240
they don't necessarily care about badges

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,720
and other platforms

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,559
but i would argue that everybody loves

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,679
that thrill of

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,280
getting like a submarine reward you know

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,480
where just that surprising delight out

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,280
of the blue

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,880
um i've also noticed that um people who

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,880
do collect

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,159
trophies for example they tend to do it

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,520
at the beginning and then they get bored

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,880
of collecting trophies so

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,240
there's quite some interesting data

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,600
right there that seen this in video

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,120
games as well like people collect the

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,720
first 15 trophies

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,960
and then that's it they just the

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,440
thriller's gone so

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,240
but to go back to katie's point or

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,720
question here

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,159
what is the best way to combine these

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,760
different approaches for

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,880
increasing contributions does anyone

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,880
have any thoughts they want to kick in

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,919
hi this is evan heaven thanks for

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,760
bringing me on uh tiny background

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,520
uh i'm with the linux professional

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,760
institute we do have

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,440
a worldwide community and thankfully we

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,880
actually have a little budget to spend

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,320
on our volunteers

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,919
and we've been trying to go back and

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,240
forth with them to try and figure out

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,919
what the people want

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,520
and you're absolutely right about the

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,440
submarine uh

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,039
incentives that people aren't expecting

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,240
and then when they get it it's just a

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,720
real surprise

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,320
uh we've also had uh success with two

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,600
things that might be worth

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,480
um when we do swag or something like

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,240
that

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,640
it seems to be important that the swag

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,240
be something where the person can use it

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,000
to identify themselves with the

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,440
community that i'm a part of this i'm

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,559
contributing to this

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,320
and therefore something you know my time

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,440
is actually contributing something back

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,200
to the community

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,280
uh something as small as laptop stickers

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,400
we've found have been amongst the most

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,039
valuable and most

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,960
interesting swag we can give out that if

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,799
they're creatively done people will

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,400
will use them with pride on their

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,559
laptops and

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,520
it show you know it speaks about them

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,480
and also it

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,200
helps promote help to promote us uh at

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,400
the other end

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,280
i posted in the chat a link to a contest

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,640
that we ran

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,400
for within our community and uh

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,919
we've always had people that are sort of

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,159
looking for things that are

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,720
unusual and if you look at the link that

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,880
i posted it shows a

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,080
programmable robot penguin uh that we

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,760
used as a contest giveaway and it was

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,120
actually proven to be really popular

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,000
we're probably going to be doing it

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,200
again

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,279
uh but small things like that

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,360
i wanted to actually ask the rest of the

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,159
panel uh we've sort of been touching

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,559
upon this

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,080
and uh within the organization we've

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,520
been talking about this as sort of the

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,039
gamification

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,400
of incentives and that is you know like

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,080
you know when you're on google maps you

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,000
get to level one level two level

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,760
three and you get to get the badge or

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,440
whatever um

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,440
jonah you were saying that you found

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,159
that a lot of people didn't

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,400
you didn't see a lot of value in those

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,480
badges and i wanted to get a better

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,080
idea of what people thought about the

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,960
value of people being able to put a

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,880
badge on

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,480
their linkedin profile or hear their

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,240
whatever in a way that says

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,640
you know i'm contributing this is you

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,039
know this is how i'm giving back

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,320
just just to be clear when i mention

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,840
badges it's not that i

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,760
think that then they don't have a lot of

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,520
value i think that just i think when it

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,520
comes to collecting badges i think only

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,880
some people are interested in that

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,559
but i think maybe what you're talking

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,080
about here evan is something different

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,679
which is a badge is a

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,120
almost like a sign of identity like

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,559
we're seeing this with politics right

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,400
now with people who are

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,760
putting badges for where they voted for

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,919
or to go and vote

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,960
there's a means of placing their flag in

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,880
the ground

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,799
and i do think those are really powerful

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,120
um so but i'd love to hear other

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,960
people's thoughts yeah i mean i think

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,240
like i think video games are good

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,000
example like the

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,600
the more badges you get you're basically

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,720
doing the same thing over and over again

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,799
of you just getting to

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,000
like a higher level of whatever game

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,480
you're playing

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,200
and i think i mean after a while for a

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
lot of people

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,400
like you're you're just being awarded

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,520
for doing the same thing over and over

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,360
again that gets kind of

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,799
like uninteresting like even in open

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,240
source people want to like

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,600
for example they're more interested in

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,080
broadening their skill sets like

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,159
learning something new as opposed to i'm

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,960
going to fix the same bug or same type

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,000
of bug like

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,400
you know you know after like

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,039
you know depending on the person after a

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,640
while

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,320
you know it's not necessarily going to

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,400
broaden your like a horizon

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,640
or your skill set so i think that might

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,640
be one of the reasons why people kind of

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,000
taper off because people want to you

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,600
know they're they're working on this

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,039
part of the kubernetes community but

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,640
they want to look at something else

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,799
and and then they want to sort of

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,120
broaden their skill sets so

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,720
um i mean john i don't know if that

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,400
might be a reason but that could be

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,320
a possibility because i've seen people

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,760
in communities they want to do something

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,440
different after a while like it's same

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,799
thing with your normal job right like

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,600
you don't want to do the same thing over

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,400
and over again

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,320
so our approach to this was that we sort

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,000
of are trying to assign values to

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,840
different activities that aren't always

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,640
in the cell right same realm

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,480
so if you contribute code you get points

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,640
if you make a speech to

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,200
an external organization and you give a

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,360
talk to somebody that counts as points

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,360
and so it doesn't always have to be the

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,120
same kind of grind to be able to get

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,480
people recognition for achievement

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,720
because that achievement takes many

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,360
different forms so it could be squashing

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,440
a bug

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,279
it could be giving a talk to another

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,440
audience about it it could be

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,200
being quoted in a newspaper in on a

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,000
website it could take many different

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,679
forms

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,360
so i'm hoping that this can be done in

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,919
such a way that doesn't get people into

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,919
that kind of right

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,840
you know there's kind of a theme forming

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,960
a little bit in this discussion around

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,679
fatigue um like bruce wrote into the

00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,880
chat

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,039
there are a whole lot of folks doing

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,960
micro credentialing i wonder about

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,159
fatigue around this and i think ray you

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,559
were touching on that a little bit as

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,240
well

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,080
just one other data point that i found

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,960
interesting is

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,840
is that um i forget the scientific study

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,679
for this i think it was the

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,039
yerkes-dodson study but it basically

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,240
found that

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,840
if you over-reward human beings

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,360
they become so focused on getting the

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,279
rewards that they the

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,799
purpose of the rewards becomes less

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,080
prevalent and i've actually seen this

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,200
myself where

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,600
there's been a couple of communities

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,799
that i've seen where they go

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,480
overboard on really rewarding

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,559
their members and giving them like

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,240
really pretty swanky stuff

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,000
um and then the members are so focused

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,440
on getting the rewards

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,440
that they're then doing the work for the

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,799
wrong reasons and i've also also noticed

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,039
this a little bit with

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,039
kind of old school forum platforms which

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,039
where people just wanted to get that bad

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,240
if you posted 500 posts you get like a

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,399
rank level

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,679
and people just wanted that that

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,200
recognition piece

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,120
um so they they just start posting yeah

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,240
i agree and plus one and all this kind

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,240
of stuff and not really adding any

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,360
content for the conversation so

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,520
i think one other thing we should

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,399
consider here is how do you how do you

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,080
reward but

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,760
i think one of the hardest elements is

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,880
how do you know that you're not doing it

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,240
too much

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,000
because there is there is the risk of

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,440
too much i think especially if you're

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,960
flush with money and you can

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,799
buy a lot of swag for people and ship it

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,159
out to people all over the world then

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,120
it's a very real risk so and uh

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,640
jonathan may ask a question yeah you

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,399
also mentioned in your book that you

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,360
know people

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,760
some like some people try to cheat to

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,000
get

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,600
the awards you know just adding plus one

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,320
and not any content that's

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,080
not really cheating but kind of but like

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,120
actually cheat so i guess you

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,559
kind of have to try to avoid that as

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,000
well right without

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:53,600
putting too many limitations on how to

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,559
actually earn the award right yeah

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,360
i think sorry go ahead go ahead no i

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,000
think it's what

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,919
is happening with the oktoberfest uh

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,200
which is a

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,240
program that is was

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,760
launched by digital auctions to like try

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,200
to get people to contribute to open

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,960
source projects

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,240
and if you are like i don't know for

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,679
like four pull requests

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,520
during the month of october they will

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,240
send you um

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,520
a t-shirt so you would get some stickers

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,320
and a free t-shirt and

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,600
yeah and this year it kind of backfired

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,679
a little bit because

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,279
there's a lot of people just opening

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,320
pull requests to open source project

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,360
with like some

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,240
yeah like just fixing a typo or changing

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,240
like adding a dot at the end of a readme

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,120
file or stuff like this so

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,720
i can see oh yeah you you get more

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,720
interested by the reward

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,159
than the actual purpose of the of the

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,240
initiative

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,000
so one of the questions that katie wrote

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,720
into the chat was how do you let people

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,960
know

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,720
the submarine incentives exist without

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,760
making them stated which i think is a

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,240
great question

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,720
my personal view here is that you know

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,520
you never tell anybody about them

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,120
you actually keep them secret um because

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,679
my worry is and i think you just

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,960
highlight this comment is if people know

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,240
that they exist

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,679
um they will try and game them to the

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,159
point where my example earlier on of

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,399
submarine incentives using discourse

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,440
um i actually recommend that whenever

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,640
somebody

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,919
takes an approach with submarine

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,960
incentives with discourse that they

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,279
actually go

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,000
and they rename every instance on their

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,919
discourse

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,120
um installation where it says trust

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,799
levels

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,480
they hide the word trust levels from

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,440
your community because if people learn

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,880
about trust levels

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,640
they'll be able to find the web page on

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,600
the internet that shows how you gain the

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,799
trust levels

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,799
even though you can configure it and

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,279
they'll try and game it

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,399
so and that's a little difficult thing

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,600
to wrap your head around i think because

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,279
we're so used to being so open in

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,080
communities but i think if you share

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,679
people

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,440
that it's a submarine incentive it's

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,480
just it takes its power away a little

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,840
bit so

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,520
and that's part of your surprise and

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,240
delight right that you're talking about

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,559
so you kind of take that away yeah i

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,720
think

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,080
also uh just to add on different points

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,760
like especially now

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,600
more and more people are quite um

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,200
opinionated about schwag so if you're

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,919
very swag heavy you know you might

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,159
actually get

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,919
a backfire criticism of how you're not

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,559
ecologically responsible and how there

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,519
should be

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,039
other types of incentives um then i

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,080
wanted to kind of plus one on what

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,320
raymond had said earlier um about like

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,440
when we've when i've designed programs

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,960
you know we said

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,120
sure there's going to be some of these

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,360
um extrinsic

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,799
you know fun things but they need to be

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,559
tagged to surprise and delight

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,000
and they also have to be tagged to

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,799
something that's really intrinsically

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,399
valuable

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,240
which in our case when we design

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,120
programs we're really strongly about

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,640
learning

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,080
like helping people because a lot of

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,840
times if people are doing open source

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,960
they might be trying to get another job

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,480
so they really want to learn or like in

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,760
a particular case i had

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,159
we were a little bit more commercially

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,200
oriented but we knew that

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,399
one our engineers were amazing and

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,159
people in our community

00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,600
just want to engage with our engineers

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,640
because if they had a talk or if there's

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,320
something going on they

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,000
they would learn a lot and secondly we

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,919
knew that our customers

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,919
were quite a lot of them were on the

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,519
cutting edge so if we would do sort of

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,039
user community events people would come

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,640
they're like oh i saw that one of your

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,360
customers is speaking on an exact

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,480
problem that

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,720
we know we're going to need to be

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,120
solving really soon so we try to really

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,559
focus that on on the learning part

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,159
and that you really want to be part of

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,679
this community because

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,760
you're going to find like-minded people

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,720
or people with similar challenges you

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,960
know who might just be

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,559
three steps ahead of you or they're you

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,399
know 20 steps ahead of you and that's

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,120
that's that's exciting as well

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,799
so like all the fun kind of stuff and

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
surprise and delight really had to be

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,760
um anchored by these core things that we

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,240
worked on yeah

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,640
totally so katie we've welcomed katie to

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,919
the fault

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
do you want to do you want to you wanted

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,279
to make a a couple of points katie

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,279
oh sorry you're muted right now

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,399
my background is in putting incentives

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,039
in place

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,919
for communities that already exist but

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,159
right now

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,519
we are working on developing a community

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,559
that

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,440
does not yet exist it is being built

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,640
from the ground

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,640
up on a digital level and

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,399
we need to draw in the volunteers

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,320
some things will bring people in just

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,480
because of the nature of the content

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:31,760
but bringing in volunteers bringing in

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,600
subject matter experts and

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:39,279
developing that incentive

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:43,279
to begin with is

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:46,720
a big part of these first steps

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:49,039
the submarine or unstated incentives can

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,600
be used as a community has already been

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,279
developed and you have that loyalty and

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,000
that buy-in

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,200
but creating that buy-in and creating

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,559
that

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,240
um incentive that will

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,559
bring people to the platform and not

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,360
just to collect points not just to put

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,399
another

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,040
badge by their name on another platform

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,480
and

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,159
something on their social media profile

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,919
so we're looking for that middle ground

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,440
of how to combine these

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,440
two pieces and

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,839
bring it together into a complete

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,119
package yeah

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,159
any thoughts from anyone on that i have

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,000
a few thoughts but i want to make sure i

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,599
don't monopolize the conversation here

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
so anyone want to share some thoughts on

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,800
kaitlyn's question

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,960
this is evan uh i mean i understand to

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,879
talk about the fatigue about badges what

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,320
we're trying to do with ours is do them

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,000
in such a way that they could actually

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,480
help people get jobs if they're

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,159
on like their linkedin profile i mean

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,679
historically one of the reasons why

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,639
people got involved in open source

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,399
projects

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,480
is it got them on the radar people that

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,639
might hire them and so

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,280
in one case if you do the badges right

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:03,839
would it not be able to sort of

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,839
help towards that end

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,880
the the budget is a great way to onboard

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,720
people

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,800
so like the stated in incentives uh

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,320
you can almost make it like a quest to

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,520
you know you want to join this community

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,079
go through those steps

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,720
and as you go through the steps you you

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,000
earn those badges and once you

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,640
you feel better or you started to be

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,119
a valued member of the community maybe

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,280
more

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:38,079
focus a little bit more on the submarine

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,200
incentives and like move move away from

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,440
the the packages

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,880
or like state stated incentives

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,560
i i do think where there is an

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,680
opportunity in this kind of

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,839
uh to your point kt is uh with

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,440
using submarine incentives is a tool

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,880
within the onboarding process

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,960
so when you haven't built that kind of

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,960
goodwill yet so just to give you an

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,599
example

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,359
um i can't say who the company is but a

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,320
while back i was working with a company

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,920
to help them build their community and

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,520
they have quite complicated platform

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,960
that their users use

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,240
and it was quite a lot of work to make

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,040
their first contribution to this

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,200
community this online platform

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,599
and in many cases the people who

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,359
submitted that first contribution

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,119
it wouldn't succeed it wouldn't get

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,160
approved essentially

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,760
um so one thing that we did is we

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,760
and this was primarily through email

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,520
automation

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,720
uh actually no it wasn't through email

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,079
automation sorry it was through their

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,000
platform automation

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,200
is that we detected when somebody was a

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,520
brand new user

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,359
they went and made a contribution to the

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,200
platform which was a big lift

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,880
and then if that contribution was

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,720
rejected so kind of similar to a pull

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,200
request being rejected

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,400
we'd get a notification of that and then

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,599
we'd reach out to them

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,000
and say you know first of all this is

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,920
very very

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,400
common don't worry about it like you

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,760
know don't don't get too disheartened

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,320
and then we'd actually send them an

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,400
ebook that we included on the email

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,320
that was in that area in that area that

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,920
they that they work in

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,760
um just to kind of like that provide

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,640
some guidance around the next time they

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,119
have a go at it

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,680
to kind of get them up and running um

00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,240
and we

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,920
we found like we built a really high

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,880
level of click rate through that those

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,480
emails

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,079
because i think in that moment of

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,200
despair of i've spent a ton of time

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,800
figuring out how to contribute something

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,200
to your service and then

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,960
it didn't work they're probably quite

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,480
rightfully annoyed

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,839
and that email was a means of just

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,320
saying like we care about you even

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,160
though

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,359
this wasn't successful and then there

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,800
was the inverse

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,480
situation as well when they got that

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,920
first contribution in which is i think

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,760
how we tend to naturally gravitate with

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,040
a lot of open source projects

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,640
then they got like you know um a reward

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,400
uh for doing it and i forget what it was

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,320
i think it might have been like a 25

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,599
amazon gift card or something like that

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,800
but there was an outcome on both of

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,920
those and what i learned from that

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
because that was a complete experiment

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,920
was

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,520
being reactive to the negative state was

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,320
often as much of an opportunity to being

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,720
reacted to the

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,839
positive state and i get the impression

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,240
there's lots of little ways in which we

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,200
could weave that into our communities

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,480
you know the first time someone

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,320
contributes something a bit of

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,160
documentation or

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,240
um the first time somebody comes to an

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,520
event or the first time somebody

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,640
registers for an event but they don't

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,040
show up

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,560
um you know there's all kinds of

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,560
opportunities i think we can move in so

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,760
um i know we've got about five minutes

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,520
left

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,040
does anybody have any any particular

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,680
burning topics they want to dig into

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,800
before we

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,800
because i want to make sure we can cover

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,480
as much ground in this session or

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,920
anything that they really want to say

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,920
i'll start looking at the chat as well

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,599
um madeline do you want to join as a

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,119
panelist you said hi yes i'm not sure if

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,960
you wanted to join because i can add you

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,720
i can add anyone else as a panelist

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,560
okay one second madeline i'm bringing

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,560
you into the matrix

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,760
okay

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,440
all right madeline will be here in one

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,440
second all right

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,359
okay hi guys hey

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,960
are you hear me yep great um i don't

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,440
have a webcam but at least you can hear

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,680
me

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,040
yeah um so the place i've been working

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,240
at for a couple years now

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,480
we um our incentives

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,839
when we you know used to go to an office

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,839
pre-coded

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,000
um were very uh non-inclusive and it was

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,240
kind of like beer kegs and certain kinds

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,760
of foods available in the break rooms

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,359
um so do you have any suggestions

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,160
now we don't have any of those things

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:41,520
because we're all working from home

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,960
do you have any suggestions that would

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,720
for incentives that would work for

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,000
everybody and that like not

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:51,359
um have anyone feeling left out

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,160
or couldn't participate because you know

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:59,280
food allergies are a choice to not drink

00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:04,560
any thought centered i have

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,560
my work with teams um working with

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,880
people in depends on the size of your

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,319
team but identifying the needs

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,880
one of the big examples i used to use is

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,480
you have a someone who just got out of

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,240
college and moved to a new city

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:24,240
you have a single parent with four kids

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:28,079
and you have a um

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,319
a grandfather who has three grandkids

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,160
and is about to retire everybody has

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,720
very different motivations but they

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,079
might still

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,400
be working on the same project so

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,480
analyzing your team and finding out some

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,000
of the big categories they fit into

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,040
and then having an incentive that allows

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,800
them to choose

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,520
from a certain number of things like if

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,040
they reach a point you can say

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,800
you can choose one of these three things

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,760
maybe it's a gift card to the grocery

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,640
store

00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,520
maybe it's a pass for a free movie on

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,560
amazon

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,560
or it's a

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,960
it's a fruit basket or a box of cookies

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,400
being sent to their place

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,760
so it's different levels of involvement

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,760
um passes to

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,760
right now socialization is difficult but

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,160
creating a socialized

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,920
environment and giving the incentive to

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,359
allow for socialization is something

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,079
that

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,240
can be yeah i think looking for the

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,200
motives of why people show up every day

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,599
is a good idea

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,599
thank you

00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,960
sorry along the same lines as katie said

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,839
what we've been doing is we are actually

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,880
asking people to update a sharepoint

00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,400
site

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,040
with their food preferences

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,599
and allergies so that we know ahead of

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,240
time

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,800
you know what people will eat and want

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,040
to eat

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,319
and we try very hard to kind of factor

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,800
that into

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,960
any decisions for you know team

00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,160
get-togethers and

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,280
make that work for everybody

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,960
that's a good idea thank you i i also

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,079
just put a link into the chat i actually

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,000
put a video out

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,839
about three weeks ago with some

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,119
recommendations around swag just think a

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,640
couple of things that i've learned

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,319
that maybe or may not be useful and

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,920
one other thing is i joined an event

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,079
last week

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,760
where they had really focused on a very

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,119
social environment people could join

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,240
like groups and get to know each other

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,839
and it was a lot of fun

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,359
and i actually regret that we didn't

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,880
have something like that

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,640
with cls because that's often one of the

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,359
main things that people really enjoy

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,800
about cls is that social component

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,040
and that's one thing i'd love to explore

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,240
more as well as baking social time

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,240
into these kinds of sessions

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:50,800
uh we've got one minute left any

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,240
there

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,079
yeah and many of you know this already

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,200
but nifio's incredible so that's going

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,680
to be a great session

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,280
uh um also um

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,920
in the next session as well is going to

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,920
be the other cls session is from van

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,640
he's going to be running a session on

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,920
creating a healthy community culture

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,760
and he's going to be approaching it very

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,440
much from the the person

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,760
as opposed to the metrics perspective

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,800
more so i'd encourage you to go to one

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,160
of those two sessions

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,400
and then of course we will be

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,839
reconvening at the end of cls it should

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,440
be 5 p.m eastern time where we'll be

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,800
doing wrap-ups and summaries from all of

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,000
these different sessions so you can

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,839
you can hear what happened in a bunch of

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,839
sessions that you're unable to join
