	00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,759
so

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,760
welcome everybody this is the session on

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,000
building diverse teams and projects

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,160
uh obviously as if you were here for the

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,360
kickoff this morning it's it's a big

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,880
passion of mine

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,400
um sort of somebody who's had to build

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,439
communities in the past

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,279
um and who's really had to build uh

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,519
diverse teams and especially now in my

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,439
role at oasis open i'm trying to

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,359
build our team to be a little more

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,439
diverse than it is it's kind of

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,880
kind of uh the opposite of diverse at

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,000
the moment but we're working on that and

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,360
i think that this is

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,040
going to be a great session for us to

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
kind of talk about some of the

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,160
the the challenges that that arise and

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
also some of the

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,200
um some of the strategic things as well

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,320
as some of the kind of the tactical

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,520
things you can do

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,239
as you think about building a a diverse

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,719
being whether it's a community or or or

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,360
a

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,160
a project so one of the things i wanted

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,039
to do

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,000
was in doing the research for this you

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,160
know i looked at a lot

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,760
of different uh articles and and the

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,280
good thing is you can google

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,799
this and see a tremendous amount of

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,080
articles on building diverse teams right

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
i mean i think it's it's great to be

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,119
living in a time where

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,400
where we really have a lot of resources

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,360
for these sorts of things so that's

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,520
fantastic

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,040
so i found an article that i want to

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,960
start with to kind of give

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,400
they had eight ideas or eight thoughts

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,080
about how you think about building

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,680
diverse teams and projects and i thought

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,040
those would kind of form maybe the bones

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,240
of the discussion and

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,159
maybe hopefully lead us in some

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,400
interesting directions so um

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,400
the eight things were number one think

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,159
about diversity from the start

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,159
makes sense right it would seem like it

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,520
would be easier to do this

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,920
rather than trying to retrofit it into

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
an existing

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,320
all organization of diversity and this

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,680
one really resonates with me because

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,079
it's not just about

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,840
um you know uh representative diversity

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,759
it's about cognitive diversity people

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,439
who think differently from other people

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,040
um you know it's about socioeconomic

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,560
diversity there's a lot of factors that

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,759
are involved here rather than just

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,439
gender identity or other things um

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,040
number three was improve your recruiting

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,200
strategy so i'd love to

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,240
dive into that one if people have ideas

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,399
around that

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,080
um celebrate employee differences so

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080
really actually giving employees an

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
opportunity to kind of have their own

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,959
cultural uh

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
affinity groups or other things that

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,120
help celebrate their differences

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,480
stop and listen to your employees again

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,800
a really really important one and i

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,280
think

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,959
one that um personally now that i've got

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,720
a sort of a different role than i had at

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,239
autodesk where i was more of a

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,239
senior individual contributor and now

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,680
i'm a leading entire organization

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,680
this is a big one for me it's one of the

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,440
ones i really try to work on

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
a lot is listening to my employees and

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,920
kind of their thoughts on these things

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,160
the next one is provide leadership

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,360
development opportunities so

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,519
really really important i think

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
especially not just in in

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,720
kind of training opportunities but

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,360
providing opportunities

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,599
encouraging folks whether it's in your

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,519
community or in your organization to go

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,360
you know put it out put a talk proposal

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
and help them see if they can get that

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,560
proposal accepted those are really

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,480
really important things um

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,080
improve your own leadership skills uh

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,920
jono knows this one really well because

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
he's my go-to resource for this we we

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,200
have many a conversation about improving

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,480
leadership skills

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,959
so i think this is really really

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,480
important um kind of as you

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,200
hopefully become a stronger leader you

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,519
can be a better leader of diverse

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,239
and inclusive teams and then finally the

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,840
other one that john

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,760
and i both like evaluate your efforts

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,760
right how do you know you're improving

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,120
um your diversity and and i think you

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,799
have to evaluate it not

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,400
from just the perspective okay how many

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,959
women do i have in my organization how

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
many

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
you know people of color do i have in my

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,159
organization it's it's really a

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,040
broader base thing around those things

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,519
plus you know

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,159
are you having um better conversations

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,879
are you having

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,040
impact um with regard to how employees

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,519
you know view your organization so

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
um those things i think as i looked at

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,239
it i really thought this was a great

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,280
place to start

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,959
basically say any of any or all of those

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,400
happy to have people thoughts and

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,159
discussions on this and

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,439
did we get a volunteer to take notes

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,560
that would be great if we could

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,640
anybody okay

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,760
uh ray asks if i have a link let me take

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,159
let me grab that link for you right

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,400
so we currently have an anonymous

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,880
armadillo buffalo

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
apobara whatever that is a chameleon and

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,799
an anteater in the dark

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
so if if those of you who are in there

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,840
can take notes that would be wonderful

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,720
because then we can we should we can

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,040
show them with a broader sea less crowd

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,840
capybara is the largest rodent they live

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,840
in venezuela

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,000
i did not know that important important

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,000
things

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
uh ray that i just put the link into

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,720
entrepreneur.com

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,400
the article that i found this info from

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,080
so with that

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,240
i'd love to kick it off for folks to

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,199
kind of weigh in on any of those things

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,199
or something different

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,120
i'm sure um well first of all it's it's

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,680
amazing

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,440
to uh to be in a session with nithia

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
again because just like jono is sort of

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,560
my

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,840
entry to community architecting nithia

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,039
was very much

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,880
um the the groundbreaking kind of

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,240
force behind me starting to talk about

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,600
diversity and inclusion

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,919
and um nithya has constantly lended her

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,759
her credibility and her platform to me

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,039
and so many people to talk about this

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,680
really important

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,919
subject and so i just think sharing the

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,759
stage whenever you get it i mean nithya

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,600
and guy you as well are amazing at

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
getting talks accepted at things

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,360
and you're also very amazing at bringing

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,199
people along that aren't always

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,120
getting talks accepted or that are too

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,240
shy you know normally and really

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,160
encouraging

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,440
different voices of the community to

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,520
find their voice

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,360
and i just nithya you're the best at it

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,639
and you've done it for me so many times

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,360
and it's it's just such an

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,560
honor to be here with you again

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,919
oh gosh thank you but but you know

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,400
um lisa murray you

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,520
really brought the voice to the table

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,639
and reminded us

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,280
of the need to champion need to

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,000
include people uh across the world and

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,759
across

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
you know different dimensions like guy

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,440
was mentioning

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,720
um and there's a famous saying you know

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,440
people are over

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,560
women and others are over mentored under

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,440
championed

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,360
undersponsored and and i think uh the

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,319
point that guy made about

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,199
uh sponsoring and championing people and

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,960
leading by example is so critical

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,199
mentoring is just giving advice but

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,199
sponsoring is truly opening doors

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,720
i think people are reading a lot more

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,440
about d e and i these days

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,880
um i i have a talk at open source summit

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,039
coming up next week that we recorded

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,880
last week and the e part is so

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,800
important google it if you don't know

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,720
about this and learn about it because

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,400
you know diversity yeah we you know

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,919
we've got we all understand what that

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,720
means and bringing different types of

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,800
people and thought

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
and inclusion is you know including

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,440
those people but the equity

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,160
part of that is really documenting that

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,160
there is

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,000
inequality and making yourself

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,319
accountable to do something about it

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,240
something tangible about it and that's

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,039
what i'm pushing corporations to do

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
these days

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,080
and i encourage people when you're

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,759
talking about dni to talk about d

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,440
e and i because we have a lot of people

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
talking and not a lot of action

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,199
so that's where the accountability comes

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,199
in

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,199
yeah that's empowerment lisa marie uh

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,599
equity

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,800
diversity equity and inclusion i'll put

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,319
some notes in afterwards i'm just not

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,360
good at talking and writing at the same

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,720
time

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,319
okay i'll put a link to a really good

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,199
article in actually i'll go grab that

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,240
now

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,960
okay yeah that'd be fantastic so uh

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,520
other folks want to weigh in and as jono

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
mentioned

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,280
you can be a panelist or we can just

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,400
enable your audio if you're shy and

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,039
don't want to show your video which is

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,120
also fine

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,800
but we would love to have you uh anybody

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,840
else chime in or chime in and chat as

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,840
well we're actually watching that as

00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
well

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,520
we have an anonymous speaker i love how

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:11,199
in zoom we have speaker and jono as

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,400
ato ato ato ato and an anonymous speaker

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
i kind of like to do that at one point

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,199
anonymous speaker

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,599
okay well i yeah that's the thing right

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,560
somebody's got to speak up because

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,560
otherwise you're going to have to listen

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,120
to me drawn on which is never a never a

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,800
fun

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,080
fun topic but um uh as we're waiting

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,279
unless somebody wants to jump in and

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,080
interrupt me let me just pull

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,120
this other part from the article because

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
i think

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,800
as i was reading through the article uh

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,959
one of the things i really

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,720
liked was um the improve your recruiting

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,160
strategy section so

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,080
they talk about a couple of things in

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,120
here rethink the language you use in job

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,959
postings

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,040
that's a big one and i know that there's

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,800
actually i believe some software now

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,680
that will go through and look at

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,399
text or job postings and figure out okay

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,279
what things

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,640
are are actually putting in unconscious

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,720
bias

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
to people of color or underrepresented

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
groups and job postings so i think

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,360
that's a fantastic

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,240
uh thing to be looking at um

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,920
they some other ones some suggestions

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,680
capped a wider net

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,839
that's always one that that can

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,360
sometimes be tough depending upon what

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,640
skill set there is but um

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,120
you know what you're looking for but

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,959
obviously casting a wider net is huge

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,399
i know at autodesk we actually had a

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,720
policy before i left

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,800
where um if they didn't get enough

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,399
candidates from underrepresented groups

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,440
they relisted the position which i

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,120
thought was an interesting

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,600
it was an interesting way to look at

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,480
that um

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,160
uh overcoming unconscious bias this is a

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
big one and there's there's a link here

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,200
to harvard's implicit association tests

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,560
to become aware of kind of your

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,279
unconscious biases

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,160
unconscious biases and uh i know lisa

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,920
marino's and

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,000
my partner nicole knows that's a huge

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,399
one for me because it was a it's kind of

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
a big

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,920
bigger story that i'm going to talk

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
about later today at two in my session

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,760
around

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,440
not realizing some of the unconscious

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,200
biases i did have so

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,320
um those are just i think some

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,399
strategies for improving your

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,320
recruitment strategy so

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,440
love to have other people touch on any

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,519
of those uh

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
recruitment strategy or or any of the

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,079
other eight that i mentioned from this

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
article so

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,720
anybody else want to want to chime in on

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
that

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,160
guy i can say something about that again

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,160
i don't want to just like have everybody

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
just be only hearing from me but um you

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,240
know i just went through kind of all

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,640
summer a long

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,680
job hunt process and i talked to a lot

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,440
of companies

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,800
um and also as a you know community

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,680
organizer we always are talking to a lot

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,160
of companies

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,760
and people are really looking at this as

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
a metric of whether they want to join

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,800
the company or not

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,160
and you're seeing a couple of ceos

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,040
recently in the news

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,640
kind of on the hot seat for um for very

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,880
apolitical languages they've put in

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,240
public blogs that basically say you know

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,200
we're not going to take a stand

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,200
on anything at our company and this

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
isn't you know the job from top down

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
and there's lots of different ways to do

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,920
that and a lot of the companies i talked

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,279
to

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,440
um there was a cpo

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,480
a chief people officer or a chief you

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
know programs

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,480
uh process officer and that person is

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,440
really sometimes recruiting falls under

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,440
that team

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,040
um and they're they're actually hiring

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,920
for these positions to put a lot of

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,240
focus

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,160
in this area but what i found is when

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,480
that role um

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,519
and nythia lauren mafio talks about this

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
all the time so i should really give her

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,519
credit for this because she makes the

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,440
point on on

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,959
my next panel that role should not

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,360
report up to hr

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,120
that diversity chief diversity officer

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
first of all not you know

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,839
i'm not a huge fan of that role anyway

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,200
because it should be everybody's

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,880
responsibility

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,480
to be thinking about these things at the

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,440
company but if you are going to have a

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,959
role like that

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,480
in order to empower that person to be

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,519
successful they have to report into the

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,880
ceo

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,839
they have to report into the and they

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
have to have metrics that are

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,680
accountable all the way up to the board

00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,639
level

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,000
because otherwise they're not going to

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,720
get the funding to do it and there's not

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,480
going to be

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,480
that top-down approach that you really

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,680
really need and then at that point your

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,320
decisions can be made

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,120
um about how to empower employees to all

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,720
go and do

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,160
that thing that we all need to do

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
whether it's giving them time

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,760
off so they can you know be a poll

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,360
worker and register people to vote or

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,800
giving time off to go march or

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,639
you know let letting people choose

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,079
what's important to them and the causes

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,079
that may matter to them

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,279
and then instead of having a ceo that

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,680
cares you have

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,360
a multi-thousand person company that

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,480
cares and is empowered to actually do

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,480
something and make change

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,480
now that's a great point it's a great

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,079
point lisa murray um

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
i'm actually trying to convince celona

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,600
convol to become a fan to

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,279
jump up to be a panelist because she had

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,200
some great points in chat here

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,880
um one of which i think related to the

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,120
whole job thing is that

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,040
we've heard often that that you know uh

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,079
women tend to want to have 100 of the

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,079
qualifications before

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,360
they will apply to a job versus men who

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,279
will do it when they're 60

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,040
and and i'm not sure that that's kind of

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,160
a cultural thing but i think it's

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,000
something that that as

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,760
you're you're reaching out you need to

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
be thinking about um and

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,639
sloane has a great point if you put in

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,480
required if you think about what your

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,200
balance of required

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,720
elements to a job is versus preferred um

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,639
kind of maybe flipping that

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,079
around a little bit maybe helps you get

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,040
a little bit uh

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,040
wider reach um can i can

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,320
one of the other things we do in all of

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,200
our job postings

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,560
is to say even if you don't qualify for

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,839
all of these

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,279
uh requirements please apply because we

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,240
want to talk to you

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,200
and and to kind of educate people that

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,800
to your point

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,880
that not all of these are required

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,720
sometimes people just tend to

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,160
put everything in the kitchen sink in

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,880
their job requirements and

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,360
and you need to you know decide if you

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,320
have

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,920
40 50 that's okay and you can

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,240
demonstrate how you can learn the rest

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
of it

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,920
right it's a great point um

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,839
and solona since you made the comment

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,880
about we're focusing on role diversity i

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,480
would love to hear

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,839
your thoughts because i agree it's

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,120
sometimes hard when it feels like you're

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,160
fishing in a pool that

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,279
to your point is 90 95 white guy you

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,360
know as i said right

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,120
um so one of the things that i i tried

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,000
to get done more at paypal and it was

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,560
kind of iffy as to

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,320
how well i could do that was looking

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,279
outside of the normal pool of

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,160
applicants and so expanding out that job

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,800
hunt where

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,600
you didn't just do the normal checks and

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
um

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,040
check-offs that everyone was doing

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,880
instead you focused more on the actual

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,160
skills that you were looking for

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,079
not sitting there saying you had to have

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
done blah blah blah instead it's like

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,399
you have the skill of this

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,519
and focusing in it that way changed a

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,720
lot like someone in the

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,800
chat just sat there and said the whole

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,160
point about um

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,639
the degrees hurting and things of that

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,399
nature

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,079
it's true especially like if you look at

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,120
me i didn't actually get a computer

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,639
science degree

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,399
i went back to school and did a bunch of

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,600
computer science courses but that's not

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,800
what i did because

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,600
i graduated in 92 and they're just

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,959
it just wasn't the thing um though i did

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,079
do decision theory so

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,839
there was that um but

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,279
you know it's like you have to sit there

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,480
and look at that from that perspective

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,600
and the other thing that i do is i look

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,440
for other

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,800
you know greater diversity in regards to

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,959
the roles where

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,079
you know when i was looking at product

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,279
managers it's

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,199
it wasn't just are you a coder it was

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,720
have you led things how have you led

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,240
things what do those things look like

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,480
and even tapping into people

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,839
who knew more about marketing or other

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,720
different things because when it's a

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,480
product

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,920
you really need to understand your users

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,800
and stuff of that nature so it's

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,800
expanding the scope

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,320
cool i think there is a there is also a

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,040
big

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,600
a big point in the seniority of people

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,040
that you

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,240
you want to hire um even more in in i.t

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,399
where if you look for senior or like

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,519
people with a lot of experience

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,839
obviously you will

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,519
lack a lot of diversity in your pool of

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,880
candidates where if you look for a more

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,199
junior position

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,079
that's where you start to be able to

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,440
have a more

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,440
diverse pool of candidate and

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,120
so you have to also try to make some

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,680
trade-offs there and maybe

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,360
hire more for the potential and more for

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,600
someone that you will help

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:23,120
build than someone that will be

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,880
effective directly in your team

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,160
all right uh i did actually want to

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,440
bring a question that uh

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,360
ray peg pike asked here uh in chat

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,959
can we talk more about casting a wider

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,839
net and i think selena you sort of

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,399
touched on it is

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,680
is it exploring more and new channels or

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,680
reaching out to a different audience

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,160
honestly i'm doing both

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,680
so on the open source side of things

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,800
with the platform that i'm creating at

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,360
ieee

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,040
i've got a community advisory group and

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,880
a marketing advisory group

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,480
and then for the technology advisory

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,480
group we're adding in architectural

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,240
reviews design reviews

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,240
you know product management tools so

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,199
that i can bring in all of these other

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,640
roles so it's not just about the code

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,039
it's about all of the different things

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,720
that people have to contribute

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,319
when i was doing the hiring at um paypal

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,400
one of the things that i actually hired

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,640
the most for was maturity and resilience

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
because when it comes down to the tech

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,520
it's going to keep changing all these

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,520
things are going to keep happening

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,039
how fast do you learn how well how good

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,679
of a learner are you

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,400
you know are you mature about doing that

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,720
you know

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,640
can can you can you stay on path and

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,320
then secondly can you deal with all of

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,280
the hurdles corporate life is going to

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,840
throw at you

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,440
you know the fact that now your path is

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,600
not from here it's not a to b

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,720
it's like oh first you have to go to c

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,320
and then you got to go over to d

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,600
and then maybe f will give you the okay

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
and then you can actually go through and

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,280
do it

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,720
i have to look for other um things

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,840
beyond the normal

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,200
thing as do you know java um do you know

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,480
java only gets you so far in the

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,320
corporate world you actually have to

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,840
have a lot of other types of skills that

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,120
need to be necessary and

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
and to be quite honest the majority of

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
the time i'm a little egotistical

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,360
because i

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,960
did you know teach at a collegiate level

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,080
but i can teach you that

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,000
um if you have a certain type of

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,840
mind and personality and so that's what

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,200
i looked for more was

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,760
those other characteristics right

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,240
guy another aspect of casting a wide net

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,440
is all of us

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,200
diversifying the number of people and

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,080
the type of people we know

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,799
sometimes if you look at your linkedin

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,400
network

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,799
you'll find that they're very

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,960
homogeneous they tend to be

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,960
all people who look like you and you

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,760
really really need to

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,720
intentionally diversify the people you

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,960
know on twitter

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,160
and linkedin and other networks so that

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,640
you can

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,000
actually go recruit people from the

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,280
groups versus

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,039
yeah yeah i mean that's a great point

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,039
yeah this morning i was watching those

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,960
keynotes and i immediately reached out

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,720
to all the speakers on linkedin and

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,679
linkedin and i would encourage everybody

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,840
who's on this call

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,200
reached out to shadrach he was he was so

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,120
excited and he wrote me

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,480
a personal note you know reach out on

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
linkedin okay you know

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,160
connect with with all of those there's

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,760
so many people at this conference

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,760
um they've done a great job with a

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,120
really diverse group of speakers so i

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,559
would say go on linkedin and reach out

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,559
with everybody and connect

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,000
and another thing um that we do so we

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,720
run a hackathon program

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
and we use a like a i don't know broker

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,720
a company to

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,720
to set those all up for us and we we

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,640
asked them instead of going to the usual

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,039
suspects you know stanford mit

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,160
all the ivs we said we want you to focus

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,039
on um

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,960
junior colleges on public schools on

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,760
historically black colleges and on state

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
schools

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,039
and they they couldn't believe it they'd

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,400
never got that request before which made

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,640
me really sad that people

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,720
aren't asking for those type of things

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,799
but you really got to push your vendors

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,640
you know to extend the reach of these

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,919
programs out to places where that people

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,919
just don't think

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,919
to to to extend that reach to

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,760
yeah definitely so

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,360
does anybody else want to chime in on

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
the casting the wider net piece i

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
definitely want to

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,280
if that's an area that that we want to

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,200
explore as a group i'm happy to dive

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,159
further into that but i also want to see

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,679
if anybody

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,280
else anything resonates with any of

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,039
those other uh eight that i

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,559
mentioned from this article around

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,919
building diverse teams and then we could

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,840
probably talk two hours on

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,520
on some of the challenges around um

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,480
casting a wider net so

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,000
um yeah and mythia says we're fishing in

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,440
the same ponds and we need to expand

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,799
where we recruit and that was your point

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,799
lisa marie i think it's a great point

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,600
so anybody else want to chime in on this

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,880
topic or

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,720
anything else one thing yeah andy go

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,840
ahead one thing i learned in an earlier

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,440
community leadership summit that i

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,360
attended several years ago

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,720
was to really kind of get involved with

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,480
like um

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,159
different niche um developer

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,240
professional groups like

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,760
i belong to girl geek dinners and

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,200
women's coding collective

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,200
at a bunch of places like that and if

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
you even just kind of reach out to the

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
groups and say i've got a job

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,919
it's a good way to start at least the

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,919
conversation

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,799
right definitely definitely

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,000
yeah totally nithya on the remote work

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,200
oh

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,480
oops i only sent it to oops i only sent

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,840
to all panels

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,039
um so remote work is just

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,799
i think crucial for a lot of this um

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,880
you know on my team right now that i

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,960
have i've got a bunch of moms

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,120
i've got a bunch of uh right now i've

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,360
got i've got an idea i've got an

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,640
amazingly diverse team right now in fact

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,640
we were like teasing two of the guys

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,440
that we have our two token white guys

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,720
um because we've got people of color and

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,960
women and

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,720
you know all kind of diverse handicapped

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,240
all sorts of different things that we're

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,120
you know working on and remote work

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,360
helps with that

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,120
so much in that they can still do all

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,039
the things that they do

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,720
especially like if you do deal with any

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,960
um handicapped individuals

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,120
who have energy issues or things of that

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,000
nature so that they can parse their work

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,320
out and show

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,600
their completion of everything and

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,039
that's one thing that i think that's so

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,400
beautiful about the remote work is it

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,400
becomes more about

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,760
not how much time you spent on something

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,720
but what you actually

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,000
did and what your deliverables are and i

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,039
think that's a really

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
crucial piece to explain in regards to

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,679
that

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,440
so um yeah i'm a huge fan of the remote

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,320
work because with remote work it's not

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,480
about facetime

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,840
it's about you know what you what you've

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,000
actually turned in

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,080
right and and sloane that's a great

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,679
point and i i just wonder as a small

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,880
side note we can come back to the main

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,880
topic if you want

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,360
as we're going through covid and remote

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,360
work literally becomes the norm

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,400
are there other aspects of what we're

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,640
going through with covid

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:55,120
that affect how you build a diverse team

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:58,320
right either positive or negative

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,400
yeah for me i um i'm benefiting

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,320
um and completely taking advantage of

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,919
all these people who got laid off

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,720
so i have to admit i'm you know i

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,679
found out from a bunch of people who i

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,039
can do part-time

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,080
and how they can do part-time because

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,280
they're also having to deal with the

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
kids and all these other different

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,760
issues

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,440
and so it's basically making sure that a

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,760
bunch of people um

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,640
do not become homeless are fed well all

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,039
you know i'm not

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,559
i'm not under paying anyone okay no

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,720
underpayment of anyone

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,640
but at the same time creating that

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,000
balance for everyone

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,200
on that so that they can actually

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,960
accomplish all the different things that

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,600
they need to accomplish during this

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,679
extremely difficult time because

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,240
everybody's got so many new burdens that

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,000
they

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,320
they hadn't dealt with before right

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,840
definitely i have a question for the

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,679
group just one of the

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,840
one of the items listed in the article

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,000
that you shared guy that really kind of

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,520
jumps out at me was this

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,360
number four which is celebrating

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,520
employee differences

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,520
um and i'd love to hear any anyone who's

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,720
who's done this and any tips and tricks

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,760
that they would recommend

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,960
for how to do that effectively because

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,720
i can imagine with some employees i mean

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,880
obviously though

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,559
i would assume that um if you're

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,279
celebrating the differences with your

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,480
employees

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,919
you want to make sure that they're

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,279
obviously comfortable with that that

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,520
you're not celebrating differences that

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,760
they don't want to necessarily discuss

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,440
so i'm just curious how people have

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
celebrated those differences and it can

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,039
be

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,600
not necessarily in a company it could be

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:33,600
an open source project or elsewhere

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,440
in a way that has been participatory um

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,840
and just any techniques like practical

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,000
ways maybe in slack or in irc

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:46,000
or in email or anything like that

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:50,240
jono a couple of uh answers on that

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,720
one is um finding a variety of ways to

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,600
get their input and connect with them

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,760
right

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,320
i think you role modeled it very well

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,480
saying not everyone needs to be on video

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,960
if you feel more comfortable putting

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,600
your answer on chat versus speaking

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,440
then that's great and this also applies

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,640
to the way we celebrate as teams

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,919
sometimes in the

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,000
past we used to always default to

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,440
let's go for a drink in the evening

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,600
right and many people

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,640
can't do an evening drink maybe they

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
don't drink

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,960
uh maybe they have to go back to take

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,600
care of their kids and so finding a dif

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,640
variety of ways so people all of them

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,840
can participate

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,039
is important i think and second is as a

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,640
manager as a leader

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,159
knowing the strengths and weaknesses of

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,200
your team and putting them in the right

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,279
role so they all

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:43,840
shine is is so so important yeah

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,840
yeah thank you

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:51,520
any other experience

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,520
or recommendations

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,440
i'm just sorry i'm re-sharing the

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,880
article and everything from neil and for

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,880
anybody else who may have just joined

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,200
yeah and just again just the uh this is

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
i keep reminding people throughout these

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,520
sessions if you do want to join this

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,960
group as a panelist

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,799
everyone i know some people have been

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,559
joining a bit later just

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,799
just type into the chat i'm happy to add

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,279
you uh you can either just speak with

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,039
your mic

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,559
or you can put your video on as well

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,080
it's completely your choice

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,679
so if you want to do that just make sure

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,720
when you do that type in

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,720
um just make sure that you select where

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,600
the blue box is in the chat and zoom

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,000
panels and attendees otherwise sometimes

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,919
only

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,039
some people will see it so yeah uh

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,640
so jono kind of a little bit echo uh

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,240
nithya's point i know when when i was at

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,640
autodesk they actually had a

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,679
affinity group and i know it kind of

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,440
just depends i think

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,960
on the employer and it also depends on

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,640
maybe the culture of the company

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,320
that seemed to work pretty well honestly

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,559
at autodesk is you know we had

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,400
affinity groups for um african-americans

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,240
we had infinity groups for

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,679
somebody mentioned you know trans and

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,559
and gender politically we had affinity

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,520
groups for that

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,960
and i think it was um it was it worked

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,799
out really well at autodesk

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,240
and again i'm not sure if it's company

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,559
culture or just kind of where they were

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,559
from

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,080
you know how they were as as a

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,720
progressive organization

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,600
but you know i had i i did um i did a

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,679
couple of panels

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,200
at some of our internal events where um

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,520
we had people

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,880
who were non-binary we had you know

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,360
women we had we had all sorts of

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,039
different

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,960
folks on that and i think that was a

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,039
testament to just kind of the

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,360
the culture that was was put into that

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,039
uh those efforts as an organization and

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,559
they were very active on slack i mean i

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,080
ran the slack instance at autodesk and

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,399
we had those affinity groups had

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,080
huge numbers in their channels so i

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,279
think that was a good example of

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,720
celebrating that

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,720
um but i'd love to hear others

ship thoughts sorry let me do that right

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,159
now

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,120
yeah you could have it so someone

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,159
brought up the

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,200
issue of trans um here uh one of the

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,840
things that

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,200
so we have two trans people on our team

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,240
and one of the things that

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,559
um i think is important is i would right

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,679
now

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,760
hate to try to force my trans employees

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,840
to move to texas

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,200
um i would prefer you know austin is

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,120

i i hate to say it but i'm 6th

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,520
generation texan

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,960
um right now i feel kind of ashamed but

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,720
i would not

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,039
try to request for for them to move

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,399
um and so that they get to stay in a

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,000
place that's friendlier

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,760
that has better trans rights in their

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,679
state that they have all of that

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,440
you won't be able to do that if you

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,440
forced everyone to to be in person

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,840

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,200

hope you can hear me

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:16,320
yes okay so i'll just introduce myself

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,799
i'm from

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,559
india and i've just joined and i just

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,279
saw a lot of tweets about this all

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,840
things open

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,799
so i joined in a nice lot of good

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,120
speakers

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,279
so here i am and so i have been

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,000
basically since the last year i've been

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,320
just want to just want to uh share my

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,520
views about the job opportunities

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,520
what i have faced since the last year so

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,679
i just left the organization in 2019

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,679
and was doing good so after that i just

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,399
decided to venture into

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,240
uh into one of my portfolio which is

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,679
into sda and networking

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,840
and something related to nfv

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,279
and i started studying and exploring

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,120
that option

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,120
uh networking with different people and

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,279
all and then started

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,440
looking for jobs so i applied for a lot

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,399
of jobs and opportunities in various

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,919
organizations

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,520
tried approaching various different

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:14,240
people so i just found that

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,240
like whenever i tried in india so in

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,159
india the problem was that

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,240
they have been always been looking for

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,840
the people uh

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,840
who have been inside those they have

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,159
been pro generally organization

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,919
promote people who are inside so

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,159
generally the positions are filled

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,000
through the inside people itself

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,159
so this is what one of the problem which

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,279
i've been facing then when i went

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,320
outside to some

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,799
other some other places like to the

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,559
north america or some to europe so there

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,720
i've just i just felt that

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,799
there i've been applying to a lot of uh

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,919
job opportunities and

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,360
and trying my best to

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,320
update my resumes as per the uh as per

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,679
their

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,360
job descriptions but i found that my job

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,279
my resume was not even getting

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,360
shortlisted so i have been getting the

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,440
responses that

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,120
you're not eligible for this or you are

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,840
not shortlisted

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,919
you don't look like a good fit instead

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,960
of being from the marketing profile or

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,600
from the technical

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,440
profile i was not getting shortlisted so

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,080
i have a nine years of experience in

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,880
telecom

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,679
world i've worked with nokia infinera

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,320
and

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,559
coriant and i've been into the pre-sale

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,760
i've been part of the pre-sales roles

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:33,600
answering all the rfps rfis

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,320
working with all the plms the executives

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,919
then uh working in infinera and korean

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,919
as in marketing profile

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,360
but then i wasn't getting shortlisted

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,120
anyway so i was just trying to find out

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,880
what is the reason why i'm not getting

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,120
shortlisted

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,120
so i yeah

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,399
well you know here's the thing it could

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,600
be a variety of things and obviously

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,799
we don't know your situation i mean um

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,960
and but you bring up an interesting

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,120
point about i think cultural bias

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,799
right and potential you know depending

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,440
on on the kinds of roles that you're

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,000
going for

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,880
or the companies that you're applying to

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,440
if there's

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,120
you know a cultural bias against you as

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,760
a person as their cultural bias against

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,240
you know

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,960
your age ages is a thing so i i'm

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,640
actually not

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,320
sure really how to answer that i'd love

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,279
to have any of the other panelists or

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,600
anybody here kind of

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,760
have have put their two cents in for

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,760
this

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,200
i would just say stay positive and hang

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,279
in there there like i just said there

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,840
are a lot of reasons why people don't

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,880
get

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,720
jobs and you know i just spent a whole

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,559
summer not getting jobs

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,000
and uh and i know a lot of people and

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,919
i'm really networked and i thought i was

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,519
very qualified for all of them um

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,880
there's just a lot of reasons you don't

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,519
always know

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,519
but just stay really positive keep at it

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,600
it's just a lot of work

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,640
and just you know keep you know just do

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,240
all your research

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,840
but your network is is the most

00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,120
important thing everyone says that but

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,440
it's really very true

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,320
you know those mentors and and who your

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,480
network is

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,760
is what open doors for you and then also

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,840
people can coach you

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,880
on specific opportunities that you're

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,039
going into

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,240
so that's probably the most important

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,440
thing and

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,360
the thing that's always helped me the

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,679
most

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,559
sure thank you so much thank you so much

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,080
lisa and

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,480
guy martin for your thoughts

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,080
it's really helpful stay positive

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,600
attitude is everything positive

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:34,640
yeah yes definitely thank you yeah

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:37,600
again i'm working on myself on my skills

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,600
absolutely i think the point about

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,120
having a network

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,519
is is quite interesting if you

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,399
put it in perspective with open source

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,039
communities

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,919
because when you start to contribute to

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,320
a community

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,720
and like start to get to know people

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,440
that's also how you start to build

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,799
uh that talk and start to know people

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,600
that you would not really

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,880
uh have opportunities to to work with or

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,159
chat with

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,560
and that brings the topic on how to

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,679
make those communities more diverse also

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,919
and how to

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,720
bring more diversities into those

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,240
communities because

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,399
i i think definitely at redat

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,359
we use a lot the communities to actually

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,480
hire people and if our communities are

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,599
not diverse

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,480
we also don't have this like

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,280
diverse group to to hire people so i've

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,159
been tested in thoughts about like how

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,280
how you promote and how you get more

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,040
more diversity

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,040
in an open source community

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,760
thank you clement for your comments

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,599
definitely how you get more diversity in

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,520
our open source community

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,359
let's see i'm only chuckling because it

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,800
seems like throughout this

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,480
everyone that almost everyone that's on

00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,040
this panel that i know and i know most

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,200
of you

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,320
it's it seems like this is a constant

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,960
topic that comes up

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,760
right and and i think it's for me it's

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,079
two things

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,520
one is it's as solona says kind of going

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,079
outside of what would be the normal

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,320
audience

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,160
right and and i have to say this as an

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,680
engineer who kind of writes code for fun

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,680
now not for a living

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,440
you know i was probably guilty of as

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,960
nithya says kind of looking for more

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,240
engineering folks but i think

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,440
you know nithya has done a great talk

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,599
and i think lisa marie's done a great

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,200
talk on marketing in open source

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,640
right i think somebody mentioned earlier

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,760
marketing isn't you have to get the

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,359
techies to understand that marketing

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,640
isn't a dirty word because you build the

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,359
best tech in the world and it's not

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
marketed

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,560
in a way that other people are going to

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,560
want to use it especially in open source

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,480
communities it's really really difficult

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,920
jono i know you've had a lot of had a

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,560
lot of things you've talked about around

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,720
how to get

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,960
people into on-ramps into communities

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,240
and and can you maybe talk about that

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,839
as it relates to diversity yeah happy to

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,880
and by the way i need to make an apology

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,839
because i've been a little bit

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,599
distracted

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,280
um without boring you all with my

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,000
housekeeping but i was supposed to be in

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,320
another session

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
while this was going on i i had no idea

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,119
about this and then they said there's a

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,079
bunch of us sitting in the session

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,000
waiting for you there was some

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,040
scheduling issues i was just taking care

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,320
of that while

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,839
we've all been discussing so my

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,920
apologies for looking distracted

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,839
um one um

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,000
one thing that i find i found quite

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,520
interesting and this kind of relates to

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,119
diversity but i think it

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,960
it really relates to the relationship

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,640
between i think people and their leaders

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,800
is just um like psychologically there's

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,560
quite a lot of research on mimicry like

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,280
where people mimic their leaders

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,200
so if you get really aggressive nasty

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,240
leaders then that can often

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,000
resonate in people who who

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,520
are there i don't like the word

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,960
subordinates but you know

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,839
people who who are who are within that

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,599
grouping um but if you get really kind

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,200
and pathetic leaders then you can you

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,240
get that in the folks as well and i

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,079
think this is where

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,320
to me it's really important especially

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,880
in open source that we

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,240
we don't just pick leaders who are the

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,280
people with the most time

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,680
or the people who started the project um

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,359
one thing that really bugs me is and i

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,040
see this a lot in silicon valley which

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,560
is near where i live

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,480
is this mentality of um

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,839
yeah they're kind of a-holes but they're

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,440
really good

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,359
and i just don't like that viewpoint

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,640
like i don't think just because you're

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,240
really technically proficient at

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,359
something that it's okay to be

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,839
mean and um non-collaborative with

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,359
people

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,119
and i think we need to start getting rid

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,640
of this notion and i think that

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,640
i don't want to pigeonhole silicon

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,800
valley too much but i think

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,720
the tech world and especially the early

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,599
stage venture-backed tech world

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,079
celebrates that mentality too much so to

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,000
me

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,720
and we should be celebrating someone's

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,160
eq as much of their as much as their iq

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,599
and um and my view is like if you have

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,880
great leaders

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,880
and especially people who are more

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,440
representative of the community i love

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,400
seeing

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,440
how the growth of people of color and

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,000
trans folks and

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,280
and women in leadership positions in

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,160
tech then i think that

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,599
is how we help bridge that gap it's my

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,200
personal view

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,680
yeah yeah i agree john i i did want to

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,280
go back

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,720
evan asked a question a great question

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,400
about governance

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,760
so i put it in chat but let's read it

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,960
quickly if folks haven't seen it what

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,720
about governance what are the best

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,280
places to find people with governance

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,200
skills

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,280
that many tech people seem to actively

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,880
shun i'm only laughing because i'm a

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,599
tech person that had governance skills

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,359
and that just

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,359
actually isn't great but for those that

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,760
want for those that want to find

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,680
interesting jobs it's an interesting mix

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,800
and i'm an odd engineer that i have the

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,400
government skills but

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,000
um where do you find people that have

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,240
active governance skills

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,040
and do you compensate directors so i'd

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,280
love to hear

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,720
other thoughts from from the panel or or

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,040
anyone else out there on that

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,640
so obviously as you know guy i have much

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,079
to say

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,079
i i figured you did because we haven't

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,800
talked about this at all

00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,119
no we don't talk about this at all right

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,520
so

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,240
at ieee um one of the main things that

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,880
we're working on

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,720
is this piece right now and so with this

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,520
new platform that we're creating with

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,440
git lab

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,359
is we're like how do we make governance

00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,880
easier how do we automate it more how do

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,359
we do all of those different things

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,240
so it isn't such a struggle every single

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,240
time

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,440
and so we're actually and it's kind of

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,520
like the interesting

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,280
merging you know because you also we're

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,320
both in the standards worlds

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,640
you know governance is king um

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,920
how do we merge that better with open

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,359
source and all the different things that

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,640
we're doing and so that's one of those

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,720
things that we're working on right now

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,000
with our platform is going oh okay how

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,920
do we make sure that first of all all

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,200
the ipr stuff is taken care of

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,400
how do we make sure that meetings are

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,079
run correctly so that we don't have to

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,680
worry about antitrust issues

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,599
how do we do all of these different

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,800
things and since ieee is

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,839
all about that um you know to a crazy

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,599
extent actually

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,680
to a crazier extent than guys group

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,839
which is oasis

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,320
i think oasis is a little bit more

00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,680
friendlier and fluid sometimes than ieee

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,040
can be

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,520
and so we're very much so working on how

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,200
do we do that for the community at large

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,200
so that you can take care of these

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,240
things more easily and not have it

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,160
bog you down as much

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,160
for the other governance skills in

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,640
regards to directors i have to admit we

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,960
haven't

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,920
been um ieee is 100 is 501c3

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,440
100 volunteer driven um we've just been

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,280
lucky in regards to the

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,760
reputation and so when people sit there

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,760
and think that marketing doesn't matter

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,359
it does if you want those people um so

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,359
you do need to make sure that you have

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,560
that kind of stuff available or else you

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,720
won't get those people

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,560
and you do want them because do you know

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,480
who gets you money and gets you support

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,160
at your company

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,000
those people marketing people yeah

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,440
yeah no it's a great it's a great point

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,960
and i love the fact that you folks are

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,880
doing that with the platform

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,119
i i mean evan says you know they have

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,960
the pmi a pmi grad on staff and it's

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,720
extremely useful

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,240
the automation is obviously fantastic

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,760
and it's a great way to do it but

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,520
it doesn't i don't think it's a full a

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,319
full substitute for finding those people

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,920
with again

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,920
more of those diverse governance type of

00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,680
backgrounds so

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,520
is there a place that you go look you

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,079
know governance governance rs i don't

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
know i mean

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,599
it seems to me that for me it's mostly

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,119
my network of folks that i look at

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,880
that do that kind of role because i kind

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,160
of naturally gravitate to that role

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,000
but i'm wondering if there's other

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,119
places that we should be looking well

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,720
one of the sneaky things that we're

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,200
doing on the platform is we're measuring

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,359
it

00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,040
and we're also giving them an avenue by

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,599
you know working on these best practices

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,440
and going towards standards where we do

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,880
actually have a reward model for them

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,280
you know we have incentives

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,119
incentives um that they might not

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,800
normally get out of a normal open source

00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,800
project because a lot of times

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,319
the coders aren't friendly to that kind

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,160
of those type of people coming in

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,599
at first and so by going through and

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,880
incentivizing them

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,920
uh i think they will come um if you if

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,760
you do more of that

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,119
and then you know there is like i said

00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,800
the marketing issue

00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,800
uh they find out they believe in your

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,720
goals they want to do different stuff

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,640
you know i don't know how many times a

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,560
governance person has like landed in my

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,599
lap because they cared so much about the

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,359
issue

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,839
um and as the candy just says here

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,400
um non-profit board training um i was on

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,040
the

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,880
the um board of directors for tana the

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,280
texas association of nonprofit orgs

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,200
they have a whole system for how to go

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,480
in there and get those people so go grab

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,920
those non-profit people

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,000
because like i said earlier that's who i

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,599
hired a lot of

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
for doing this new project was

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,560
non-profit people not open source

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
um but i felt like i could teach them

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,800
those pieces but

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,079
it's hard to teach that ethos and so if

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,400
you grab those people who already have

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,760
that

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,599
sharing wanting to be transparent ethos

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,800
then i think you can you can travel

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,319
faster

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,400
awesome so hey we have a couple of

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,560
minutes left and uh

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,520
the speaker who put the the last link in

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,000
for panelists

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,000
vicky is that actually you because no no

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,680
um it is vicky's thing i didn't know if

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,760
my i can't tell it says me

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:11,119
so i don't know what it says for you um

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,720
i raised my hand because uh i was gonna

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,200
i was gonna kind of echo what she was

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,359
just

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,800
saying is that if you can't actually get

00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,880
non-profit folks

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,480
to come work for you and be on your

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,079
board although that's good

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,319
um there are folks that um do consulting

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,599
that will help you do a lot of the

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,839
things that nonprofits

00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,520
do like strategic planning we're using

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,800
someone great right now over at the open

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,520

and uh some of the other stuff like you

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,920
know hire a fundraising person who's

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,960
maybe

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,839
like from you know fundraising and not

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,200
from open source there's a lot of

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,119
different ways that you can bring people

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,839
in

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,119
and that whole that that repo is all uh

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,440
fast governance

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,240
uh resources so like documents and code

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,440
of conduct

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,880
uh examples and things like that

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,040
oh and now i have to now i have to

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,119
chuckle because uh jamie clark my

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,960
my uh general counsel for oasis is on

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,480
and says he hearts vicky and her webpage

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,960
which is awesome because we all do

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,000
because vicky is awesome um about a

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,040
minute left here

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,359
anybody want to uh add anything

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,440
on this or any of the other eight things

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,119
the only the only thing i would love to

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,960
if we have an opportunity here in the

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,319
last minute is to talk about evaluating

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,920
your efforts because i think that's

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,440
something we haven't covered and it's

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,839
really really important at least to me

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,760
about

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,200
how you kind of make sure you're making

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,680
progress in these efforts so anybody

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,960
want to

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,960
comment on that aspect

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,960
well just like we always talk about

00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,560
documentation and documenting all of

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,599
these processes that should be

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,599
part of the charter of your group your

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,079
organization your company whatever it is

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:50,000
so those metrics should include

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:52,160
diversity equity and inclusion metrics

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,760
and documenting i mean yeah i mean do

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,359
you have examples right

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,119
at least you have like examples of what

00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,400
those metrics would look like

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,160
well actually i put you on the spot

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,599
sorry yeah exactly well the community

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,400
that i'm running here is more of a user

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,240
group and it's not

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,760
developing an open source code it's you

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,119
know it's cloud native containers

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,359
um in the bay area we have physical

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,480
meetings and all of that so um

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,920
and i've been running it for eight years

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,400
and i haven't had a lot of other people

00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,040
to like document and pass it off to so

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,280
i'm probably

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,720
not the best um unless you're talking

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,680
about from a corporate standpoint in

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,079
which case yes

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,520
it's part of our okrs it's part of our

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,960
metrics that go all the way up to the

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,319
board and there's accountability

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,599
at the c level for it in corporations

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,359
um but if you're speaking about

00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,880
specifically in

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,160
software open source software

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,200
communities i think somebody else should

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,319
probably speak to

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,599
that documentation yeah the chaos

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,760
project and nicole

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,640
are are doing you know a lot of work

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,079
around

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:48,400
how to track the diversity of

00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,200
open source projects particularly in

00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,680
leadership

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,599
and other positions not just the number

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,920
of people coming into the funnel

00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,960
but are they also growing with the

00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,960
organization

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,000
and you know being given a chance to

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,400
grow

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
i would also say companies need to

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,760
continue to be transparent

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,760
and share all of their diversity numbers

00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,000
companies in silicon valley used to do

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,760
it and then they stop doing it

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,839
and they really need to continue to do

00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,839
