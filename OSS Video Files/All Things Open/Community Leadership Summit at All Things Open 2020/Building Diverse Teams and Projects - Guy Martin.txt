Abstract: Diversity is critical to building amazing communities and open source projects. In this session we want to focus on two key areas: (1) how to build a community of diverse people and skills, and (2) how to enable a community to build a diverse range of projects that solve various problems. Come and join us and help to refine how communities can be truly diverse!
