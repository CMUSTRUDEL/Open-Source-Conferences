Presented at All Things Open 2020, Community Leadership Summit

Abstract: Communities are notoriously difficult to measure because they combine tangible and intangible value. Possibly the most critical question though is, "Is our community healthy?" In this session, we want to dig into what "healthy" means and what we need to measure to truly understand community health.

hello hello

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,400
um so thank you so much for the

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,519
absolutely amazing introduction

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,640
uh i'm actually your facilitator um

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,279
for measuring community health and uh

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,080
this is

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,920
really honestly your conversation uh but

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,960
before we do get into it i just kind of

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,680
want to have

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,400
um a quick discussion about widening the

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,720
discussion about metrics uh because

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,040
for most community managers um

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,719
regardless of what your specific role is

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,000
whether you're an architect or an

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,239
evangelist

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,200
uh something along those lines metrics

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,559
is

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,239
a very complicated question to answer

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,440
a lot of people just get um pushed by

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
the stakeholders above them uh to say

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,160
hey

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,879
what exactly is the roi of your

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,320
community

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,760
how can you prove that us funding this

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,119
project or this open source uh endeavor

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,280
or maybe this brand uh is actually

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,439
worthwhile and on the other hand it's

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,159
also your job to advocate for community

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,159
members

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,720
and the easiest way to do that is to

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,840
show what's happening in your community

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,280
what does that health look like um so

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,280
the question

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,479
that a lot of people tend to go is what

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,600
is that key metric

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,080
what is that kpi and that's a very very

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,119
difficult

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,159
question to answer not because you don't

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
have a funnel

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,840
or your marketing uh setups aren't

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
correct or you don't have the right

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,799
technological platform

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,200
but because what you're really doing is

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
not measuring the behaviors of people in

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,000
a community

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,320
you're measuring the community itself

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,520
and people are hard to study they're

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,360
hard to research um so this discussion

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
is going to be centered around

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,520
widening our understanding of what it

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,880
means to measure

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,159
a community um from just a simple

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,719
number or a kpi or a

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,280
funnel to more of a journey

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,360
understanding what it means for

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,599
people to into your community what it

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,400
means for them to engage

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,319
uh and kind of move beyond very very

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
basic metrics

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,239
but with that having been said there's

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,160
also going to be a diversity of people

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,280
who are at different places

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,920
in what i tend to call your metric story

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,760
um so on one end it's you're in a cave

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,160
you don't have any metrics

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,239
and you flip that light switch on and

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,519
you say what's going on and the numbers

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,360
start trickling in

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,720
and then you just see the big wide world

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
and you're like oh no

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,000
there are so many different metrics and

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,280
you can get a little bit metrics

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,599
obsessed

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,840
um that metrics obsession puts you in

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,200
this massive sea of numbers that doesn't

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,239
necessarily

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,519
mean anything to the roi of your key

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,400
stakeholders

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
and it definitely doesn't sound anything

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,360
um

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
sound any bells or anything like that

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,720
for problems that your community members

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,200
want to bring up to you

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,920
so the question is what is the story

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,840
that your metrics your numbers can tell

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,280
that both empowers your community

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,680
members uh

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,599
to act and behave get connected

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,800
self-disclose uh their feelings their

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,200
opinion

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,239
and their opinions while also on the

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,280
other end

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,280
uh ensuring that your metrics uh

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,640
prove the roi and achieve the goals

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
and the mission of your community uh so

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,680
this is

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,120
a very big conversation uh i'm gonna go

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,519
ahead and turn it over

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,360
to everyone else but before i do uh

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,280
there is going to be a google doc

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,799
that i am actually going to share here

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
in the chat for all of the people who've

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,159
come through and

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
we're going to turn it over to you so

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,879
we're going to start with the very

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,159
specifics what problems are you having

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,879
in your community

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,000
um what's the main trend what's

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,400
happening there

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,120
uh and then what does that mean for

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,560
measuring community roi

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,439
uh with that said uh we do have a few

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,879
questions that we can get started with

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,760
in order to move the conversation

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,640
forward

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,159
and uh feel free to unmute your mics or

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,239
turn on your video or

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,440
just post in chat whatever you feel

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,840
comfortable with

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,560
um and then let's just kind of move the

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,240
discussion

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,680
in the way that's going to be best for

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,360
you and your

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,479
metrics so the first one that i have

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,320
is uh how do you prove the roi

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,360
of your community to key stakeholders i

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
think this is one of the biggest

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,840
questions community managers

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,520
constantly get uh and there's a there's

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,680
a converse question here

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,600
uh what do you expect of those same

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
stakeholders

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,479
for their participation in community in

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,840
order to see the value for themselves

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,479
so does anyone want to kind of comment

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,280
on that

00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:10,880
what do you do in your communities what

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:14,960
do you think of the biggest trends

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,960
uh it looks like rey has unmuted

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,360
hi can you hear me i can now yeah

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,400
okay great i am

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,080
so the question i think needs to be

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,840
turned on its head actually

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,880
and the guy question one for always

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,919
for me always is

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,000
what does your stakeholder value

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,280
not what your community members value

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,919
which is important

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,160
but for the community to get funded to

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,280
continue to have a meaning in a business

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,440
context

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,720
what do you what do your stakeholders

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,199
want to do

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,680
what do your what do your stakeholders

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,680
want to get out of the community what's

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,800
important to them what's keeping them up

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,759
at night

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,240
then you decide then you align your

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,080
community along those lines whether it's

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,240
along marketing lines whether it's on

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,280
support lines especially on

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,080
developer type communities

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
support communities it's all about rois

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,400
all around

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,560
call deflection etc but you've got to

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,560
start with what's of value to your

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,520
stakeholder

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,240
and i think many community managers get

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,880
tangled up

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,039
as uh as you say samantha with all the

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,600
metrics the internal metrics

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,199
which are to distinguish from impact

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
metrics

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,440
i would i would call them analytics you

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
get caught up with the analytics the

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,360
analytics of the platform

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,440
whether it's cross whether it's sw

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,240
whether it's swooping yammer whatever it

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
is

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,680
but i think everyone needs to start with

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,120
a basic

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,919
question is what does my manager want to

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,639
want to know what does my director want

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
to know

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,479
what does my funder want to know what

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,880
does my sponsor want to know

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
and then we're from that then that will

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,520
give you a clue

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,520
as to what you should be measuring

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,120
over or end

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,199
i don't know other people want to

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,240
comments on that

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
this is israel um

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,240
thank you for for that particular

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,520
comment been drawing back to

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,240
uh starting with what's valuable to the

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,240
stakeholder

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,280
one of the things that i know i'm

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,479
challenged by with my team

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,759
in my environment is

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,599
the stakeholders are not there

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,800
we're building stuff we're producing

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,199
stuff for

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,400
the stakeholder that needs value um

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,520
but for whatever reason um

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,520
you know we're separated we're several

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,960
steps removed from from being able to

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,800
talk to the stakeholder and so

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
i hear from my team all the time how do

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,360
we know that we're actually doing

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,160
something

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,319
uh useful to somebody or what how do we

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,479
know what our impact is

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,520
and so i think it's it's very important

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,400
to

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,479
um make sure that there are our

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,280
communication links open communication

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,720
links

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,720
between uh our our group and and

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:30,400
the people who are asking for our help

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,759
moreover going back to the question

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,800
about value i think that

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,399
you know a lot of times stakeholders are

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,039
coming to us

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,080
asking us to get involved and design and

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,880
develop

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,839
a solution partly because they don't

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,040
know what

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,920
exactly they want and then the big

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,640
challenge there

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,160
is to not make assumptions not think

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,760
that we know more

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,800
not to second-guess what their ask is

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
about

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,279
but rather to get them involved in the

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,880
the actual development

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:08,800
stage design stage and then constantly

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,240
um bring them in for demos and reviews

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,040
so that they're they feel like they're

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
part of the process

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,839
first question can people hear me yeah

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,720
okay so i'm involved in a fair amount of

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,920
i'll call

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,320
philanthropic endeavors and

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,080
i think rather than you say you're

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,040
measuring people

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,399
and what we do is we measure impact um

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,080
it's not all about

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,360
people um it's about how we affect the

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,800
community

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,640
so one of them is called the sports

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
philanthropy network it's based in

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,959
chicago

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,800
uh it's promoting inclusion it's trying

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,440
to help with racial bias

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,200
in professional and amateur sports as

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,800
well as around the country

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,880
i'm actually the world conference is

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,320
next week what i'll be doing a week from

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,440
today

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,600
and in

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,040
interacting with the people involved

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,480
with that

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,680
um it's a matter of what

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,680
programs are we are being provided

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,880
um what impact they're having on the

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,600
number of people

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,320
and what people are getting from it and

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,320
then

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,399
the measurable is how many people get

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,640
involved after a program

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,800
and so i'm a bit curious if the people

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,680
here are talking about world all things

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,480
open

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,160
are things being affected by technology

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,399
are things being

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,360
affected by the amount of people that

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,360
are working on something

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,760
yeah i i think that's a really really

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,519
good point

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,440
the idea that your key stakeholders

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,200
that are funding the community that are

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
reporting to the community

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,120
they're definitely looking for those

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,560
goals and those benchmarks those

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,519
guidelines

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,600
so maybe measuring impact um and

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
figuring out exactly what kpis that

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,360
determines

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,800
uh might be more important for them um

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,440
but they still need to be

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,560
involved in deciding what that impact

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,240
looks like

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,240
and how it should be measured

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,200
one of the things uh i've seen in kind

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,240
of past

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,000
lives in terms of stakeholders

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,519
is that i i think executives like

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,959
can often perhaps overly focus on what

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,040
you know what metric is going to look

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,000
good in the press release for example

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,279
you know we had

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,320
we've been 50 000 download so

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,120
this month we have 70 000 downloads you

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
know we're

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,800
and whereas they so particularly

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,200
sort of softer metrics they're kind of

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,959
less interested in that because often

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,760
executives are very numbers

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,959
and data oriented so they so they want

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,480
things that were

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,519
very quantitative uh measurements which

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,519
may not be

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:11,680
in many cases aren't really the most

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:14,720
important things

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,720
yeah and um trying to figure out like uh

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,480
we tend to call those vanity metrics and

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,480
the important question i think occurs

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,600
there is how do you determine

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,600
and when do you decide um

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
that those metrics that make you look

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,720
good uh

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,920
versus those metrics that are actually

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,480
actionable

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,959
um for determining your community health

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,639
um

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,320
how do you actually set that line in the

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,839
sand and figure out what your vanity

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
metrics are

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,530
weird all right this is very weird not

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,600
being able to see the other people

00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,920
[Music]

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,320
and you're a center stage so keep

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,320
smiling

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,200
um so ray although i can't see his last

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,480
name

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,880
um talks about impact

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,240
i am curious so ray mentioned he's with

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,440
the world bank

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,440
um i am i do stuff with

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
the sports philanthropy network i'm very

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,399
involved with something called the

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,200
jewish federations of north america

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,800
which is

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,240
i'll call it a social services

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,959
organization

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,079
um and then several other philanthropies

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,680
um

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,360
the largest of which is called the joint

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,760
distribution committee

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,440
um and they're located everywhere you've

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,880
never wanted to travel

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,279
uh but where there is need for help um

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,720
and i'm one of those idiotic people that

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,279
when there's a

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,279
major storm or horrible something

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,240
happens i travel and i set up a tent to

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,000
help people

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
um in all the places again you've never

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,399
wanted to be and it's

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,000
easy when you're when you're on site to

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,399
measure impact

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,920
i'm curious if the other people here

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,920
especially with the gentleman who said

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,199
he's with the world bank

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,839
um do you get to see your impact

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,440
or are you only looking at data

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,240
analytics are you only looking

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,320
at what comes through you know via the

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,560
data side versus what you can actually

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,560
see

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,600
uh hi eugene this is ray this is ray

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,000
eisenberg i am

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,800
so i consult to the world bank but i

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,480
don't

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:28,079
travel to far off places as you do

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,839
and what we call fcv fragile conflict

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,079
and violence um areas

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,440
and in fact uh the world bankers had to

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,440
pull back from certain

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,600
areas like yemen because it's too

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,399
dangerous and we can't actually

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,199
witness uh ourselves what's going on but

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,399
we do that

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,000
we measure impact through proxies

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,480
on the ground obviously ngos local

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,920
health ministers education ministers

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,560
agriculture ministers

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,279
development ministers who whatever

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,440
program

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,639
the world bank is involved in then we

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,959
measure

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,680
that we measure impacts there i think

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,440
that

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:10,839
the hard thing as a community manager is

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,760
what uh how much can you

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:18,720
attribute to what a community is doing

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,880
versus what all the other programs uh

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,560
there are doing

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,079
so if you're talking about improving

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,519
uh literacy programs

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,920
and there are probably half a dozen

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,720
groups and organizations on the ground

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,360
there

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,560
all working on building schools training

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,600
teachers

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,480
providing local school access providing

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,519
uh

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,399
funding for kids to get actually get to

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,120
school

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,600
so what impact does community have in

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,639
those

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,680
in those areas what does what does your

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,079
unlike

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,320
in person community or online community

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,839
and i i'm talking about communities of

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,360
practice here

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,639
uh what um what impact

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,360
what um proportion of that change

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,199
in behavior or whether it's increasing

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,440
literacy or increasing

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,959
teaching ability what can you attribute

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,959
to your community program

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,240
i don't i hope that helps us say we

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,360
don't actually

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,320
we don't have to go there uh we rely on

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,720
reports from

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,880
from people at the scene or on the

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,720
ground there

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
i think it's a great question uh how do

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,079
you determine the actions of your

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,680
community in to see of all the other

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,720
actions happening in your community

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,480
in your company or what your

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,279
stakeholders are doing

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,800
um does anyone have any insights or what

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,839
are you doing in your community in order

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,839
to separate those

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,320
come on folks there's 41 of you someone

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,320
speak up

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,520
hey there i can speak a little bit um

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,160
you know for

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,880
i work at git lab we're an open core

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,679
business

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
um and so you know one of the things

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,880
that we measure

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,720
um is our community activity through

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,919
merge requests that are merged

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
um into our product and so you know we

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,559
know when a

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,079
merge request is coming from a community

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,360
member it receives

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,559
a label um on our platform that'll

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,480
you know indicates community

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,520
contribution and then

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,240
each month as part of our

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,440
monthly release we can count the number

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,320
of merge requests that are coming from

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,240
the community

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,000
um i'm happy to report that that trend

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,280
has been you know going up and to the

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,320
right for a long time

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,720
um and we also each month pick out a

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,240
contribution from the community for

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,160
recognition in our

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,360
uh release post uh we you know

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,080
call that person our mvp and they

00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,679
receive

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,200
you know not just the recognition in the

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,760
blog post but also

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,880
um i think they get some some swag or

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,200
something like that

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,799
um so you know we're measuring the

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,919
impact through the number

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,880
um of contributions which you know

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,440
may some may say is a vanity metric but

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,919
um

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,799
you know i think um you know tell us

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,400
it's important

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,480
uh but then we also dig into like the

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
quality of those contributions

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,760
and highlight those exceptional ones um

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,840
for additional

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,840
kind of recognition

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,200
i absolutely love that solution the idea

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
of

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,600
uh having like a piece of content that

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:44,000
both recognizes your community members

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,000
and also tracks the um

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,679
the uh i totally just lost my train of

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:57,840
thought like tracks their

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:57,840
um activity over time

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,280
yeah i think another thing that we do a

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
bit ad hoc right now but might be cool

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,919
to

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,400
um formalize it into our data collection

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,600
is looking at the number of you know so

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,360
for

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,440
just to give some additional context for

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,679
each kind of merge request or change

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,880
that someone's proposing to

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,960
gitlab there's a corresponding issue

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,960
um in our kind of issue tracker and

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,280
community members or other or other

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,760
folks can give a thumbs up to an issue

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,640
that they

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,000
you know presumably want to see results

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,200
there might be folks that do thumbs ups

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,520
for other reasons but i would say the

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,960
vast majority of people doing thumbs up

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,640
are doing that because it's an issue

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,400
that they hope to see resolved so it

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,679
could be cool to track

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,679
not just the number of merge requests

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,679
but also like count the number of thumbs

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,679
ups on the issues that we're closing

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,720
um with those merge requests each month

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,720
to kind of see

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,160
you know if those are high priority or

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,679
kind of low priority issues that are

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,400
being closed by these community member

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,400
merge requests

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,080
absolutely this is really cool uh

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,039
i do also want to point out we have an

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,960
additional question

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,120
christy if you want to uh kind of

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,400
elaborate a little bit on your situation

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,159
uh we can but it kind of boils down to

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,559
it's hard to incentivize the community

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,880
to share impact stories

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,760
uh in the way that you're kind of

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,159
mentioning

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,039
uh do you have any thoughts on advice

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,840
and development

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,159
given how large and international the

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,559
organization that she's participating in

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,840
is christy if you want to elaborate

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,840
you're welcome to

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,280
uh yeah i'll elaborate a little bit um

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,679
hi everyone

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,559
so i work for an international democracy

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,679
organization

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,039
and i work on connecting some of our

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,360
democracy

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,000
organizations around the world with tech

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,360
partners in silicon valley to

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,039
like raise concerns uh about uh

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,200
you know issues that they're seeing in

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,120
their political context related to

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,760
democracy online

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,240
so as you can imagine it's like a really

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,799
uh

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,840
interesting space to work in um but you

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,000
know it's just

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,440
it i'm still like sort of struggling

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,440
with um

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,200
a way to incentivize i mean i guess i'll

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,640
have to go to the session later about

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,360
incentive incentivizing and rewards um

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,400
but uh you know incentivizing our our

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,280
members to

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,840
share some of their uh impact stories

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,760
with us

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,120
just because they are so busy they're so

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,600
overwhelmed

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,480
um and so it's kind of difficult so any

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,679
thoughts on

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,280
on that would be appreciated christy

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,880
um the first thing i'm going to say i

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,280
just took a very quick look at your

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,919
organization as you started talking

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,440
um the first thing is you mentioned that

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,120
you're trying to partner with companies

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200
in silicon valley

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,640
uh i would highly recommend to you that

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,679
you take a look at

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,360
other hubs around the country um

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,280
of companies that are doing good things

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,039
so you know certainly i'm sitting in

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,880
raleigh north carolina

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,600
there are no less than hundreds of

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,679
startup companies in this area that have

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,600
specifically given time to their

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,440
employees to do things

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,880
that support good efforts towards

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,039
volunteerism

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,960
um a lot of them are giving time off for

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,840
instance to volunteer at the polls this

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
year

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,240
uh so i i noticed you know the name of

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,480
your organization that seemingly

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,240
that seems to fit so instead of just

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,000
looking at silicon valley you might

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,320
you know take a heavy look at raleigh

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,880
north carolina and nashville tennessee

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,880
shortly boston massachusetts there are

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,600
hundreds if not thousands of companies

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,640
that would be interested in partnering

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,440
um and quite honestly i i've never even

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,159
heard of you

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,159
and knowing how active i am in the space

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,840
and on social media

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,679
i think you need a social media team to

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,240
get out there and start putting out your

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,240
information

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,280
hi christy this is ray ray eisenberg

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,120
as i said with the world bank we have a

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,559
similar issue with our community

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,559
managers

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:08,000
and uh two approaches that we've taken

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:11,760
one uh for most projects

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,840
the team any project team has to

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,159
uh report on its proposal because

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,000
they're often spending 25 million 50

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,960
million 100 million dollars on these

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,320
things so

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,720
the bank and its uh funders need to know

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,600
has their proposal been successful so

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,880
they're already

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,559
writing some kind of report so if you

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,080
can grab those

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:37,280
then they won't have to do double work

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,280
in reporting to you uh the second thing

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,600
and it sounds a little hokey but we do

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,080
have a community manager's appreciation

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
day

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,600
i mean we celebrated like the rest of

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,279
the community managers

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,600
community do and there's a competition

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,919
around success stories and

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,880
it surprised me but people are really

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,840
interested

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,880
in presenting their work and competing

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,039
and that has been successful as well

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,600
in getting success stories and they've

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,840
um as well as the community presenting

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,559
to the other community managers

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,159
their own their own senior managers and

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,000
directors show up and

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,440
and they're quite proud when their

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,480
community team

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,159
wins an award some kind of award for

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
their submission so

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,120
those are two possibilities you might

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,120
want to consider

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,640
thank you both it's really helpful

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,080
absolutely

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,240
and i really like one of the other

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,480
comments that we have in chat about

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,080
um reaching out to already existing

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,640
communities and just saying hey

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,279
we're resource uh we're here if you're

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,840
interested

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,840
and we'd love to get involved more

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
personally

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,259
[Music]

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,559
it was an absolutely great conversation

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,039
um kind of discussing how we get

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,480
people involved to move uh beyond our

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,919
organization and connect

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:07,440
um but i also kind of wanted to um

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,480
kind of move uh into the trees a little

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,440
bit and talk about

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,159
brass tacks um like specific metrics and

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,799
maybe

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,840
members of the chaos community can kind

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,120
of

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,960
chime in here how are you measuring

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:28,480
incoming members and whether or not you

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:32,400
need to reach out

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,600
so hey gail kia in the

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,559
remotelab project that we have in chaos

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,559
the software

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,200
that you can use to understand the

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:44,880
metrics about community

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,440
there is a feature where you can see

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,440
what community members contributed for

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,320
the first time for example

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,039
in the gitlab and so if you want to

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,120
identify

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,080
new people that have never contributed

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,760
before

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,360
you you get that list when they first

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,559
contributed and you can

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,080
actually reach out to them and it also

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,600
goes the other way around you can see

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,320
who stopped contributing

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,000
so let's say you're interested in

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,760
someone who hasn't contributed in six

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,960
months and you want to reach out to them

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,679
then you can do that as well

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,320
um i don't know if anyone is using that

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,720
feature

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,000
well i i know some people are but i'm

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,679
curious if anyone here

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:38,640
on in this session is using

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:41,440
something like this

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,200
oh georg what was the question again if

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,600
they're using the feature to identify

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,799
first-time contributors

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,200
yeah a feature similar to what grimoire

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,240
lab

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,200
is offering or you can see

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,000
who contributed for the first time on

00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:02,480
the gitlock for example

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,480
it doesn't have to be this specific tool

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,480
so i know you know ray um

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,480
i wish ray was here because he would be

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,679
able to explain this better than may but

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,120
uh we do track first-time contributions

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,960
and send people like a cool mug that

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,720
says

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,399
how to get lab logo and says hashtag my

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,919
first mr emerged

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,600
for people when they have their first

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,159
contribution merge to gitlab

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,960
i'm not sure the exact implementation of

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,720
that

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,159
um i don't know if that's through

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,480
petergia or if or

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,279
if we're using a label to identify those

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,720
folks but

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,279
unfortunately ray would be the one to

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,600
answer that question

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,320
okay yeah no worries but it's cool that

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,720
you do

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,520
track that and reach out to the people

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,559
just out of

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,279
curiosity if you want to send them

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,360
mugs i assume you need to somehow

00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,320
collect the

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,279
the physical address how do you go about

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,080
doing that

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,760
because yeah i think the email addresses

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,200
are captured in the commits

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,039
and then um there's like a form

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,360
that is sent to them basically we use a

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,320
vendor so folks can

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,600
you know open a url and kind of enter

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,399
their information directly with this

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,440
vendor who

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:24,559
handles the uh you know pickpack and

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,559
ship kind of part of it

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:33,039
that's awesome re

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,919
related to that i'll turn on my videos

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,360
since i'm talking

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,240
um the i put in the um chat open

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,720
hub um which is something that my

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,360
community has been using to gather stats

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,880
about

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,480
like just contributors and who's

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,840
contributing what

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,960
um you can if you wanted to look at ours

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,240
this is one that

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,559
gives a contributor summary um

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,240
and so we put our org in and you can see

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,279
a list of everybody who's

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,559
that commits by top contributors it's

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,679
really interesting because it gives like

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,399
a breakdown of

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,039
um percentage of code like 30 day

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,760
summary 12 month summary all time

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,600
and you can sort of see who's sort of

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,440
dropped off

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,640
um which i think is really fascinating

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,399
and who which

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,679
um contributors have picked up steam

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:27,360
um and that's helpful for us

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,760
um so that we understand who's um

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,480
so i work in an open source community

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,000
that is

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,399
um filled with universities

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,320
and so it allows us to then reach out to

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,240
university leadership

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,080
and say okay why aren't you contributing

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,000
anymore what happened

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
um is it just you know you got a really

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,399
big project going on

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,120
um and you you know you can't contribute

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,640
right now

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,240
um or is is something else going on are

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,559
you going in a different direction

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,960
entirely um so we found that pretty

00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,960
helpful

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,120
absolutely and um i really really wish

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,640
that the metrics conversation was a lot

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,320
longer uh but we'll

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,679
we'll try to figure out a way to

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,559
continue the conversation because it

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,600
looks like

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,480
uh there's a lot going on there um but

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,200
i did also want to mention that it seems

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,360
like

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,559
uh someone in chat actually has the

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,880
opposite problem

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,840
um like they have so many contributions

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,520
and they're getting so

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,520
overwhelmed that it's not so much a

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,320
matter of measuring as it is

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,919
acting on those measurements and if you

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,360
want to describe it a little bit more in

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,320
depth that'd be helpful

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,320
but i suppose the question might be when

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,360
you have a little bit of a fire hose

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,360
of data and contributions coming in how

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:51,840
do you use metrics in order to narrow

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,840
that down and manage it

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,600
uh i'll take a stab at this one but i

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,000
don't think i have a great answer i

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,919
think

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,399
you know there's probably two problems

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,440
one is like a high volume of

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,200
um contributions from the community and

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,559
um you know like the recent kind of

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,399
hacktoberfest uproar shows some of the

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,000
issues there when you're like kind of

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,679
receiving more contributions than you

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,279
can keep up with even if they're all the

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,399
same type of thing people opening issues

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,399
and merge requests

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,000
um it seems like there's also this other

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,519
problem where you have lots of different

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,360
kinds of things that you're kind of

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,440
receiving from the community so

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,960
and looking at the comment in the chat

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,640
it's you know about requests for

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,080
mentorship and career support

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,159
helping people find jobs it's like

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,600
there's a wide range of these types of

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,960
requests coming in and

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,640
each one of them requires like a

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,559
thoughtful um

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,960
response calling on probably a different

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,679
part of that person's expertise and

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,720
and and experience whoever that is

00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,720
that's responding to those

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,919
i think the problem is probably a little

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,640
bit easier to solve when you're

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,640
receiving

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,840
a large volume of requests of a similar

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,880
type um

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,840
i think you know there's systems like

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,240
you know service desk features or um you

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
know like

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,880
something like zendesk or you know that

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,320
could probably help you with that if

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,919
you're if it's just a higher volume of

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,640
request of the similar type but when

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,240
it's

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,600
you know lots of different types of

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
requests i think that's a much more

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,840
difficult

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,679
problem to solve and i think one of the

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,120
ways we've done this in the kubernetes

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,080
community is by creating

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,840
programs around a lot of these efforts

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,120
so we have really strong programs around

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,000
things like mentorship

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,360
for example so you know when you can

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,159
take the things that you get all the

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,760
time

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,840
and rather than trying to handle those

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,360
on a one-off basis create programs

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,919
around it so that you can do something

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,000
that

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,039
scales better for the size of your

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,559
community

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,960
and i think it's also important to be

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,880
clear about what you are going to

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,399
help with and what you aren't going to

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,000
help with so a lot of us

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,240
you know a lot of communities just say

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,760
that we're not we're not in the business

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,200
of helping people find jobs that's not

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,399
what the community is about

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,240
so being clear about what what bits of

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,760
of the request you're willing to handle

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,919
as a community

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,279
and what bits you're not and then take

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,960
the bits that you're willing to handle

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,640
and if you've got a scale problem figure

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,799
out how you can put programs in place to

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,039
scale them

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,039
yeah i'll plus one dawn on that one i

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,240
think having a really clear scope

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,799
about like here's where uh

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,720
this group of volunteers can help hear

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,120
stuff that we can't help with

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,480
and then also maybe even a path to hey

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,559
but if you

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,559
see you know if you find this kind of

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,039
request super compelling

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,399
um we do this to some extent in the

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,360
wordpress community where i'm a

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,720
community leader

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,840
um here's how to set up a program

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,720
to do either peer support or

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,880
to gather people together to be able to

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:07,840
scope out a program and then

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,840
support it going forward so

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,359
yeah i hope that was a helpful answer

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,480
um kind of being a little bit selfish on

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,159
my end uh

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,520
one of the main ways that i handle like

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,320
a large influx

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,919
is recognizing that it's not necessarily

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,200
a problem of behavior or how many

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,320
commits that you're getting

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,560
or the influx of the actual uh

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,440
content but it's more a matter of social

00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,440
listening and

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,800
recognizing that there are trends you

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,679
can abstract from

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,000
and um truth is in the trend power is

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,240
the

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,639
pattern is one of the things that i uh

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,560
tend to say i got that from chris mercer

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,399
um so the big question is what's that

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,919
trend and what is that big action that

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,440
you can do

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,960
in your project in order to make it

00:34:49,440 --> 00:35:02,320
easier for them to

00:34:50,960 --> 00:35:05,359
manage those comments on their own

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,920
so um as we kind of come through like

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,960
we have a ton of questions and uh we

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,680
just want to make sure

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,359
that we're capable of getting to like a

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,839
lot of larger questions so i guess i'd

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,599
like to toss it to everyone here

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,280
what is one of the biggest troubles or

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:24,480
the biggest issues that you have

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,480
implementing metrics in your communities

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,920
we don't track people and people don't

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,960
want to be tracked

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,960
that's our biggest problem

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,280
so like people want their privacy and

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,480
uh it's very difficult and it's very

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,720
difficult to identify

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,800
what's a contribution to the project and

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,920
what is a distraction from the project

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,119
because it's not always super clear but

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,480
more than anything

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,599
for our the stuff that makes it really

00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,760
hard for us to detect like

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:04,240
who's taking part in a productive way um

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,119
we we didn't ask for permission to track

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,359
people's

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,119
activity way back in the day because

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,839
that was antithetical to a lot of our

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,359
principals

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:16,320
and now getting that consent

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,119
uh is super duper complicated so i would

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,520
love to hear

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,240
from more communities that are like

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,599
intensely privacy conscious

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,240
about how you measure progress and

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,000
impact

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,400
because yeah i can at least tell you

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,359
that

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,520
again i'm in raleigh i was involved in

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,440
the local jewish community here

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,079
and to say that these are people that do

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,240
not wish we used to have a directory

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,160
a printed directory of addresses of the

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,079
community and if you can imagine

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,440
a group of people that do not want their

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,200
address

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,960
in a directory where people can find

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,320
them this would be the community visit

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,560
the history

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,160
and over time it was education it was

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,720
letting people know that

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,400
we can't help them we had a family

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,000
services group we had a vocational

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,440
services group we had a

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
group where you know potentially helped

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,400
you find a job if you needed a job

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,320
and we couldn't help we couldn't measure

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,440
how we were doing we couldn't see if we

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,520
were expanding

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,040
unless we knew you where you were and

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,480
there had to be a trust that we weren't

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,599
going to we were going to stop printing

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,079
the directory

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,800
but we still have it i can tell you that

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,720
10 years ago that population was 10 000

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,960
households it's now something in the

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,960
neighborhood of 50 000 households

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,800
i won't say that we know where every

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,160
single family is maybe

00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,400
75 what i can tell you

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,040
is that we didn't know until three years

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,079
ago how large a community there was

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,800
in holly springs or fuquay marina which

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,040
is

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,240
uh 20 minutes 25 minutes south of

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,400
raleigh

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,000
and so we knew to put family services

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,720
down there we knew to put

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,960
a social services office down there and

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,680
that became because of data feedback but

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,359
it was educating our population

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,119
and was making them feel comfortable

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,880
that their data was safe

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,280
and one of the things and it's still a

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,359
problem today is look at most

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,480
non-profit websites there's no data

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,520
policy

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,880
it's so simple it's a page it's a link

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,400
off a front page

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,359
saying we're not going to share your

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,359
data we're not selling your data

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:24,240
it's not on most non-profit websites

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,800
yeah and i think it might be worth um

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,599
kind of

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,320
diving a little bit deeper into that um

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,680
if you don't have that data privacy

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,760
um what is the quickest and easiest way

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,480
for you to implement that

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,720
uh in your community without it being an

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,720
incredibly overwhelming legal task

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,040
i mean my comment is always steal it

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,119
from another non-profit that did it

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,920
already

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,880
but the realistic part is that every

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,760
board

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,359
has at least one attorney and one or two

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,079
data people

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,400
and you know get an example and generate

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,040
it

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,240
and most other people on a board won't

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,680
argue because

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,520
if they've never thought about it they

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,480
don't know how to argue

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,240
um and most of them will always listen

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,280
to an intelligence attorney if you can

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,640
find one

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,640
no offense to attorneys of course

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,280
so in the chaos project what we have

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,720
done because we're all about measuring

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,760
community health

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,119
is we have our own dashboard

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,320
and we just link to it on our website

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,800
and we say hey

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,599
we have all this information go check it

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,000
out yourself

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,599
you can see what data we have and it's a

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,320
service that we provide to our own

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,040
community being fully transparent

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,160
but then if we need it for our own you

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,839
know we want to understand

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,240
how the community is doing then we have

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,480
that data readily available there

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,520
and we announced it on the mailing list

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,680
we let everyone know

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,119
this is happening and if someone wants

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,160
to opt out they can opt out and

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,160
re-anonymize them

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,599
awesome contributions um and

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,000
unfortunately we are coming a little bit

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,040
to the

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,440
end here uh so there's one big thing

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,960
that i kind of want to make sure exists

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,920
in the metrics conversation because it's

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,359
huge right

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,280
and all your communities are going to be

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:24,400
very very different um

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,920
so what was one big key insight that you

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,240
got from this conversation

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,200
um what are you going to be uh taking

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,240
home with you

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,880
so to speak and everyone

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,160
feel free to um contribute what you

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,680
think either in chat

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,680
mic or over overview

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,400
so one thing john said earlier is he

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,640
wanted to

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,240
understand whether the issues that were

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,960
being closed are meaningful

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,359
to the community and by using the thumbs

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,079
up feature so i already created a pull

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,160
request

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,520
to the chaos community to add that to

00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,520
our closed issues

00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,839
metric

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,119
any other big insights or um perhaps

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,240
you're also coming away with

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,839
a more defined problem what is that one

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:35,839
big thing you think you need to solve in

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:35,839
your community

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,079
yeah i'll just add i appreciated dawn's

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,480
perspective on

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,480
um creating like working groups or

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,240
committees to kind of

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,240
focus on specific areas where you're

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,040
seeing high volumes of requests and also

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,599
andrea's point

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,240
um to having a clear scope for what your

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,599
community

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,599
kind of can and cannot support

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,839
thank you eric thanks for opening that

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,839
pull request that was awesome

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,520
i thought the comment around measuring

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,960
impact and helping

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,440
contributors have a or community members

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,720
better understand the impact of their

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,720
work was

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,760
really really insightful and i think

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,760
that's a great way to

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,359
navigate away from vanity metrics and

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,920
more to

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,359
measurements that will empower people

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:45,839
for years to come

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:45,839
so that was a good reminder

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,880
thank you so much and uh we do have uh

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,319
two minutes plus some time afterward uh

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,319
if you just kind of want to talk more

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,119
interpersonally and whatnot

00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,520
um we do have a little bit of time for

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,680
any

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,599
final thoughts not necessarily related

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,240
to a specific question or anything along

00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,240
those lines

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,599
i just want to thank you for having this

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,520
sort of breakout

00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,880
um this is a good break to a very

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,800
technical day

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,040
and getting to do something where i can

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,920
take it back to the

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,200
groups i volunteer with um is a really

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,960
cool thing i

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,640
hope a lot of people in here connect and

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,119
put their information in that google doc

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,119
you set up

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,000
the one thing i'd maybe just like to add

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,960
is that you know the

00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,760
what you measure reinforces the

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,440
behaviors

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,040
that drive it so just think really

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,520
carefully about what you measure

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,880
and how you do it um because it will it

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,400
will drive behavior

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,240
and if people can game it to be on the

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,640
leaderboard

00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,640
they will

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,520
yeah that is huge that is huge uh

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
oftentimes what you measure

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,200
also means what you value and if people

00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,880
know what you value

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,800
in that community they will change their

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,720
behaviors

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,560
so sometimes it could end up changing

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,520
the very culture of the community when

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,119
you say

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:22,880
you are changing the metric toward a

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:26,240
specific goal

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,240
i really like that contribution

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,000
it looks like uh amber is wanting to say

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,560
something so

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,200
um before we do that uh just closing

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,119
statements

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,359
um metrics are hard and they're

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,720
difficult and they're very open

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,720
and we're talking about something that

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,040
is highly socioecological

00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,720
um we're measuring communities and

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,000
getting a grasp on that can be a little

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,240
bit difficult

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,200
so we'd absolutely love to continue the

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,599
conversation

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,440
we have these conversations every day in

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,359
the chaos community

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,880
and i am also more than happy and

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,119
willing to network

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,400
if all of you want to network as well if

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,000
you have questions you weren't wanting

00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,920
to bring up or anything like that please

00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,839
feel free to connect with each other on

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,520
linkedin or anything like that

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,760
uh we're gonna make sure that this

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,000
conversation does continue

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,119
uh over on the google doc where we have

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,680
networking options

00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,280
an entire list of resources and one of

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,079
my biggest goals coming out of this

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,400
conversation

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,520
uh was for us to give you what is

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,319
essentially like the

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,640
beginnings of a toolbox uh that allow

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,079
you to kind of refer to it

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,240
throughout the course of your

00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,000
conversation on that google doc

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,440
so thank you so much it was a lot of

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,720
great engagement

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:46,880
and i think it was a really good

00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:48,960
conversation as well

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,960
