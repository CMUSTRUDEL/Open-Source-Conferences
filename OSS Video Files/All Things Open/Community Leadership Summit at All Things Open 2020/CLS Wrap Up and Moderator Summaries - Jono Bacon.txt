	00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,120
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,160
to

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,920
in this session we're just going to go

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,880
through and provide some summaries and

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,880
i'm thinking

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,240
maybe each of our session moderators

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,360
here can begin

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,480
and then we'll see how much time we've

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,000
got and if we've got some time for some

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
general queuing at the end we can maybe

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,160
do that we'll just

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,680
we'll see how long we go um if you don't

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,880
mind nithya just because we have the

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,000
most recent session

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,720
it will start with you um and maybe you

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
can share

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,079
some of the key insights that you you

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
garnered from the session that you

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,000
you want to share with with the group

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,160
and also for everybody who's

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,600
in the chat feel free to share your

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,280
insights as each of these different

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,800
moderators are speaking as well

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,399
so anything that really jumped out at

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,000
you um i'll

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,440
i will re-share while nithya starts

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,800
talking i'll reshare the link after the

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,719
documents as well

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,920
um so you can go and you can go and see

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,480
all of the notes as well

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
so thank you how many minutes do i have

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,840
why do we do

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,840
what do we do maybe three minutes

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,519
so hi everyone my topic was

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,479
fostering and mentoring new community

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,400
leaders

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,760
and one of the first things we said

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,600
upfront was

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,600
that most of us who have been in

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,640
community management really learned on

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,040
the job

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,640
and there was no school to go to for

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,840
community leadership or community

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,920
management

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
and so we were trying to explore is

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,439
there a way we can

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,600
help people become good community

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
leaders and community managers

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,439
one of the first things that someone

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,920
said was you know you've got to be

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,880
motivated you've got to have the energy

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
and the drive

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,560
and the desire to be one or else you

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
can't

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,159
you know train that into people because

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,720
it's a people job

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,360
it's it's it's very much of an emotional

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,640
and people

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,360
type of hurting job right but but

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,119
people did feel um the community that we

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,960
were talking to did feel that there were

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,439
a number of things we could do

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,040
to help community managers become even

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,520
better

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,799
one of the first things of course is

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,040
mentoring

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,880
whether it's formal mentoring informal

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,440
mentoring shadowing

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,440
pairing up a senior community leader

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,560
with someone who's up and coming

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,680
is a great way to do it and many of the

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
senior folks

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,239
were absolutely willing to

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,720
be contacted to offer mentorship and to

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,599
offer

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,959
help and so that we felt was a really

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,400
good way to

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,800
bring up the next generation of

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,599
community managers if you will

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
the second thing we talked about was

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,200
just

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,400
volunteering in a small way initially

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,160
whether it's facilitating meetings or

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,319
doing documentation it's how you grow

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,840
your community leadership skills and you

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,120
continue to

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,680
grow those skills the third area that i

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
thought deb

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,000
brought up which was really really good

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,920
is community leadership and community

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,040
management is not a static

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,760
science it really needs to evolve and

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
change

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,239
based on how things go how things don't

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,840
go

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,680
and it varies from community to

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,319
community it varies from project to

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,400
project

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,720
so you really need to do a gut check at

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
the end of you know every major session

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,920
to see

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,680
did this work did this not work what do

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,360
i need to improve and what do i need to

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
change

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
clearly some of the other resources

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,599
people brought up were

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,959
books uh books that jonah has written

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,720
and there was another book

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,640
that someone referred to and

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,400
i'm going to try to get that and update

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,120
that in the google doc

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,959
which you can read community leadership

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,000
summit was also brought up as another

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,640
great resource

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,680
not just for learning but also as a

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,000
support system

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,239
for community managers because one of

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,959
the points that jonah brought up was

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,360
we all need emotional support we give so

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,480
much

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,280
when we are people leaders and community

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,879
leaders

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,439
and sometimes they often don't work out

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,560
and you know you reach a low point and

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,760
you need to

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,760
be able to check with your peers and

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,720
check with other community managers to

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,040
get that

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,319
emotional reinforcement if you will and

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,000
support

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,680
so net net um you do need to have

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
the disposition to be a community

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,160
manager but there are tons of resources

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,720
and codification of community practices

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
books and forums like the community

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,960
leadership forum

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,560
that can help you get even better at

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,560
becoming a community manager

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,639
wonderful thank you nithya it was a

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,600
really good session lots of really

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,560
interesting discussion

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,400
very well attended um thank you for

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,360
coordinating that nokia why don't we

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,840
now go with uh with guy martin who ran

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,800
the

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,560
session on building diverse teams and

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,560
projects

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,320
awesome thank you jono so

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,800
it was really interesting because there

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,840
were three i started out with an article

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,000
that um i found on entrepreneur.com

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
that talked about eight areas that kind

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,639
of you would think about in

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,320
terms of building diverse teams and

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,080
projects and what was interesting is the

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,120
major themes of discussion kind of

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,840
revolved around

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,840
three big areas the biggest one being

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,680
strategies for recruiting diverse

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,160
uh members into your interior either

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,320
your community or your organization

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,280
and you know i think a lot of those were

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,960
around things like

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,199
looking at unconscious bias and job

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,160
descriptions uh which we know is a huge

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,560
huge issue

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,160
um casting a wider net especially in the

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,160
open source world so broadening your

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,840
focus beyond people who just

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,199
provide code even though this engineer

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,000
love my code um

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,720
but you know really um kind of thinking

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
about

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,160
also how you write these job

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,639
descriptions because it's very it's been

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,440
very

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,759
well documented that a lot of women will

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,759
not

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,360
buy for or people from under represented

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,280
groups will not apply for

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,479
a job if they don't meet 100 of the

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,240
qualifications so

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,160
really looking at the balance of the

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,240
qualifications uh and

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
what you define as preferred versus

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
required

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
uh there were a lot of comments around

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,600
remote work which

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,880
you know not surprising given the what

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
we're going through now that

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,479
that remote work really opens up

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,280
opportunities to bring more diverse

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,360
people

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,680
moms you know people with disabilities

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,280
bring them into your organization

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,039
um and it a great point by selona about

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,720
the fact that remote work also

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,560
in this era lets people live in more

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,360
tolerant environments so for example

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,520
people who

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,160
are trans maybe being able to live in

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,840
more in states or places where there's a

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,440
there's more tolerance than there may be

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,120
in some other parts of our country

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,600
so i think those were really fantastic

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,520
um fantastic things that that got

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,520
brought up as part of that

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,800
uh there was a section a little bit

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,039
where we talked about

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,639
celebrating employee diversity uh so i

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,479
pointed out that my previous company

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,960
autodesk had a large number of affinity

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,880
groups

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,560
um and they were really created to give

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,639
opportunity to network

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,759
either via asynchronous things like chat

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,440
or email lists

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,800
and also in person events and those are

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,560
really great ways to

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,919
celebrate that diversity and i think

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
it's not just

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,840
important for your your organization

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,440
it's important as people start talking

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,800
about your organization or your project

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,160
hey that's a place where they really

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,840
celebrate and they really put their

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,520
money where their mouth is in terms of

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,120
celebrating those things

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,720
um people basically it also came up

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,800
this came up in both celebrating

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,080
employee diversity and in the evaluating

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
your efforts piece which we'll

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,520
talk about in a second but keeping your

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,199
organization accountable

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,639
so um making sure that they actually um

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,400
do what they're saying they're going to

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,000
do that they they do these kinds of

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,560
employee celebrations

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,599
um and i think one of the things we also

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,080
figured out was that it's really

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,680
challenging

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,360
in open source communities and projects

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
to allow it to allow these kind of

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,240
celebrations to happen it's probably

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,759
easier in a corporate

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,680
environment to do these affinity groups

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,120
necessarily than in in some of these

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,759
open source projects although i'd

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,960
love for us to find ways to change that

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,680
uh and then finally

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,120
evaluating your efforts so um somebody

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,720
pointed out that tracking

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,560
d and e and i that's equity vote so

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
lisa marie namphy pointed out that d and

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,720
i also should be d e and i

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,879
diversity equity and inclusion tracking

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,879
that performance is really important

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,240
uh because of every what everyone

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,599
realizes that what gets measured

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,120
actually gets done

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,960
and somebody brought up the chaos

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,039
community which i think is a fantastic

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,879
thing and i say that not only because my

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,599
partner is now the co-director of chaos

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,879
community

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,039
but because they're doing really great

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,240
work around building they have a whole

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,880
diversity inclusion

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,279
um subpart of that community that works

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,120
on

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,320
coming up with metrics for how you

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,159
actually measure

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,519
good diversity and inclusion in open

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,360
source projects so

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,440
um i think really that was that was it

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,640
for us

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,920
awesome thank you guy wonderful

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,440
so um why don't we maybe maybe mary if

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,519
you don't mind going next your session

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,360
was on connecting community endeavor l

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,920
teams with other teams

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,959
it was indeed we had a great discussion

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,320
um

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,320
there are a couple major questions that

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,920
came up the first one was how do we make

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,480
sure that we're not taking on work that

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,040
isn't

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,720
deveral specific um which is always a

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,279
great conversation to have

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
and the the primary takeaway from that

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,160
was

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,440
we can teach teams to fish rather than

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,000
fishing for them

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
um so for instance teaching a developer

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,480
marketing org

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,080
how to write a compelling technical

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,160
newsletter for the community

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,760
um rather than taking those tasks on

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,959
ourselves month over month and so

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,160
working with them to help

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,519
kind of help them understand hey here's

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,040
the content that's interesting to our

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,000
developer community or here's some

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,560
interesting blog posts

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,920
and making that more of a mentorship

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,360
opportunity than

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,880
a task that we have to do um

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,040
the second main question was um

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,800
how do we get people internally excited

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,440
about the work that devrel is doing

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,760
if developers aren't the main focus for

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,200
your community or for your company

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,040
um and there are a couple things here

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
and i think these things apply

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,399
for how to get people internally excited

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,839
about devrel even if your main audience

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,079
is

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,480
developers but making sure that

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,959
you can really communicate and so

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,360
communicating early communicating often

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,480
even the things that we might think are

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,800
mundane

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,560
um or things that we think aren't a big

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
deal you know hey got a blog post

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,399
published

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,880
on this other community website might be

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,279
a normal part of our day

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,000
but sharing that back out to the company

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,160
um

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,720
in a way that's accessible to them so

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,959
for for my team we now have a

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,800
trello to slack integration so that when

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,480
we move something into the done column

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,440
it automatically fires off this

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,720
slack message so people know this thing

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,800
happened you can click through and see

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,000
the trello card for more information

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,480
um really allows for some internal pr

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,320
and exposure uh but also gets

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,200
communication going between teams

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,800
so that they understand what it is that

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,160
we're doing and some of the value that

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,200
we're contributing there

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,320
awesome thank you mary wonderful

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,440
um so why don't we i'm just randomly

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,800
picking why don't we

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,880
maybe go next with deb who kicked off

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,519
one of the first two sessions with mary

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,440
and that was how to create a sustainable

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,360
community

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
yeah thank you it was a really good

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,360
conversation um

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
we started out by talking about what

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,839
does sustainability mean

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,880
and um we had a lot of good thoughts

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,760
around that

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,320
like separating power from individuals

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
um

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
protecting people from burnout planning

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,279
for succession

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,200
um making people feel supported uh

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,279
and then bolts of like how

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,839
you do that and what that looks like and

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,040
the kinds of things that you might do

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,040
um we did talk a lot about uh burnout

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,639
and building organizations that aren't

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,680
headed for burnout

00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,240
and making sure that you're modeling

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,120
not being headed for burnout by uh

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,920
keeping good

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,720
tabs on that for yourself um and

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,639
modeling taking vacations and time off

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:14,160
and not being at every single thing um

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,200
we also talked about uh that leaders

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,320
it's not this

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,720
uh static thing where you uh

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,079
stick at the top and accept every

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,880
speaking opportunity

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,360
every visibility opportunity but that

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,680
you're

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,200
constantly grooming other people and

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,399
encouraging other people

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,120
to take bits and pieces on to um to be

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,519
in the front

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
to you know be the person that answers

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,079
the questions to be the person in the

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,399
spotlight

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,160
um so that it's the whole organization

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,519
it doesn't seem like it's just a single

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,000
person it seems like

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,519
uh like a vibrant mixed community of

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,560
different people

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,079
uh as far as the succession stuff uh

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,839
we talked a little bit about keeping

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,079
good documentation

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,480
um building in some redundancy and

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,000
cross-training and making sure that

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,760
you know you don't have things where

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,839
only one person knows how to do

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,800
the thing and nobody's written it down

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,120
and that

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,120
you know these are ways to help bring

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,639
people into the organization by

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,800
giving them something that you used to

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,279
do um

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,360
so that you are constantly you know

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,720
teaching other people how to do

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,279
some of the projects things uh and then

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,120
uh we did talk for a while uh

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,600
i guess about like gratitude and

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,560
thanking people uh whenever you can when

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,360
you introduce them

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,880
when you are uh you know doing your

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,399
release notes

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,160
any kind of different place where you

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,000
can say like

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,680
hey i just saw that you did your first

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,639
patch i just wanted to let you know that

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,839
that was cool

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,760
or um you know any any kind of

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,199
opportunity that you have to like

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,040
recognize people's work and their

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,560
contributions in a positive

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,440
specific not cut and paced way um

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,440
is going to help you build a great

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,720
sustainable community

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,600
so um i see like we didn't um

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
we did end up talking um not so much

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,680
about

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
money we really talked about the people

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,480
side uh but we ended up with a lot of

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,880
great

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,199
resources at the bottom of the document

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,880
um if anything was mentioned

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,720
or you mentioned something and it didn't

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,839
get into the dock now's a good time to

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,079
put it in

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,279
and uh i think that covers what we

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,399
covered so

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,079
awesome thank you deb so

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,079
why don't we go with van who ran

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,040
or facilitated the session on creating a

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,000
healthy community culture

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,320
sure so um actually uh seems like there

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,839
was

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,160
some overlap with the most recent

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,160
session

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,040
i think one of the concepts that we

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,920
talked about uh quite a bit at the

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,639
beginning was

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,199
this idea of self-disclosure being

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,760
important

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,839
in building solutions for that it was

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,639
actually samantha who had um

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,800
talked about this and uh her example was

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,000
a report chat with ritual wine nights

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,279
for instance um

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,839
as an example i think another thing that

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,519
was

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,360
should be no surprise here it's kind of

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,120
a it's kind of an aha thing when people

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,800
first come to cls

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,880
is that the challenges that people are

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,639
experiencing

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,720
are a lot of people were experiencing

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,480
the same challenges we're all having

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,279
similar issues and so you're not alone

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,040
and related to that one of the

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,079
strategies around that for your own

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,600
well-being

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,959
as well as the well-being of the people

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,320
that are most active in your community

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,920
is to find

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,440
like-minded people in the community to

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
be like a well-being accountability

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,560
buddy

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,839
so someone that you can you know when

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,639
you're having a tough day you can

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,320
actually talk to

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,079
and or actually maybe someone that even

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,720
knows you well enough

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,639
uh that they can tell like they see a

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,639
response on the community like oh maybe

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,199
you need someone to like uh talk to

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,160
and uh support so that that's really

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,560
important

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,240
we talked about radical candor being a

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,079
very effective

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:08,160
in uh dealing with difficult situations

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,560
in the community in a healthy manner um

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,959
and we also talked about this concept of

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,000
responding versus reacting

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,759
and this is actually an area where uh

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,560
mindfulness practice can come into play

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,720
because uh

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,000
it's it's easy to say that we want to

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,120
not just react to situations

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,759
but take time to you know respond uh

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
wisely but sometimes it's not so easy to

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,079
do

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,120
and mindfulness practice could be a way

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,000
to do that one of the things that was

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,519
shared was i

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,880
i think it's in the resources for our

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,680
session is i guess there's actually a

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,360
free online version of the mindfulness

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,720
based stress reduction program which i

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,959
do highly recommend

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
it's an eight-week course it's usually

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,279
not free so

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,279
uh you might want if you're curious at

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,560
all that might be something to look at

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,839
and um one other thing one other thing

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,240
we talked about

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,920
is this evaporative cooling effect that

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
can happen in communities and

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,040
there's description of this but

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,920
basically

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,199
um it's important to address the bad

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,160
behavior in the group

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,559
uh otherwise the more productive member

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,839
you know

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,760
it's typically not your most productive

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,600
members that are the source of that

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,240
uh and when uh it's left unattended then

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,480
you tend to lose the productive folks

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,640
you end up with the unproductive folks

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,520
so yeah so it's important to address

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,000
that

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,360
we actually had a specific example of

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,320
that in one of the communities that i

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,080
worked with

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,559
as well where uh we needed to

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,799
uh it was around microaggressions so

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,280
it's like being aware that you know

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,640
those can build up and and make an

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,640
environment toxic even if

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,960
an individual one is not toxic so it's

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:52,240
important to address those things

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:55,280
um i don't know if anyone else wanted to

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,120
share anything through the chat or if i

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,039
missed anything

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,880
yeah and feel free to pop in anything

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,880
that any of the moderators here

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,000
um either didn't touch on or that you

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
want to really underline

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,120
uh i think we're gonna have a little bit

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,559
of time after we do these initial

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,240
readouts and then we can always

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,240
see how we can use that there were

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,440
fairly extensive notes in our doc so

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,480
yeah i've noticed there's been a lot of

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,160
good note taking today

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,559
good grief there are extensive notes in

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,559
your dark

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,280
we will also share the entire drive with

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,039
you for you too

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,960
uh shortcut and everything like that

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,360
i'll just post that in the comments

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,640
wonderful thank you so much so john i

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,160
didn't look at the other ones but where

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,520
did people grab the chat log because

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
people asked me to do that in mind i

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,360
thought it was fantastic because there

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,200
was a lot of

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,200
content in that i cracked

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,640
so um i think

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,960
i think i yeah i'll go and see if what

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,200
we

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,480
added nithya's but if not we'll we can

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
we can pull that and add that into the

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,440
document as well

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,880
just uh one note to the moderators if

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,120
you got private messages make sure you

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,200
remove them from the chat box

00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:08,240
[Laughter]

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,520
yeah what's learned here leaves here

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,200
but the names

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,799
yeah what happens at cls stays at cls um

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,919
is that everything on your plate uh van

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,799
is there anything else you want to dig

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,520
into

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,200
that's that's good i think i'm good all

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,919
right so maybe amber do you want to

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,600
do you want to go next um and poor amber

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,760
there was there was a

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,600
calendaring problem where i promise you

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,320
this is not sabotage

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,880
where both cls sessions pointed to my

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,760
session

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,520
and uh yeah so we're going to point the

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,039
finger of blame firmly ato in this

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,640
particular regard but

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,640
what what did you take away from your

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,799
session number on planning and running

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,880
online and personal events

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,000
it was it was a really great discussion

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,600
um every it was

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,360
it was lively um and but i think

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,440
i mean we discussed so many things

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
everything from what kind of scheduling

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,360
process

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,039
to uh the technical side of it uh

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,400
you know how to make your event stand

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,600
out uh

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,320
transitioning from uh like regular

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,799
events

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,600
uh like hackathons into a virtual event

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,840
like how would you

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,960
do something like that scaling your

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,520
event um

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:24,159
fighting like um uh demand

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,240
or zoom fatigue if you will

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,000
so many different things went into the

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,159
discussion but i think the key takeaway

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,480
points that maybe people don't

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,200
normally think about when you're talking

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
about events

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,039
is if you're going to switch from an

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,720
in-person event to a virtual event don't

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,919
change the dates don't change like

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,919
especially if you've had

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,039
multiple years of this event keep it at

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,960
the same at least

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,440
date range because there's muscle memory

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,200
involved people expect you know like if

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,640
all things open all the sudden change to

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,440
march people go where is it in

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,000
you know in in the fall so you know um

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,919
keep it

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,679
in that same date range same dates if

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,520
possible but at least the same

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,360
date range um the other thing

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,080
incentivize your live events

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,360
versus on demand so make sure you know

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,120
drive people to your

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,520
to your live events because you won't

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,679
get as much traction necessarily

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,360
out of your own demand events because

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,320
you've caught people's attention

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,640
you've got them in this brief moment so

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,880
how do you incentivize people to show up

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,000
for the live events and then don't

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,520
reinvent the wheel

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,480
i think that was like something people

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,679
don't think about it's like oh my

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,720
goodness we're gonna switch

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,520
from in person to live uh

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,120
or yeah in person to virtual events and

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,559
also we need all this new tooling we

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,320
need all these new things when

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,600
chances are you've already got the tools

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,400
to get you started

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,200
so pick a lane and start and then build

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,360
on that

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,320
you know next time don't just say oh my

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,520
goodness i have to

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,200
like invest 100k to get my event off the

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,240
ground when you probably have tools

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,400
that'll get you

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,280
um where you need to go so those are

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,000
like the new

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,600
um kind of things that we discussed and

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,720
then of course all the the regular stuff

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,240
how do you plan

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,240
you know what points do you talk about

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,919
what things and then um i've got some

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,640
checklists and stuff i'll drop into my

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,120
document

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,120
um when things slow down a little bit so

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,520
i'll keep updating the

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,880
that document tonight so um everybody

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,000
has it

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,480
great thank you amber and then uh

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,480
samantha your session was on measuring

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,640
community health

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,520
what were the takeaways there oh you're

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,200
muted samantha

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,960
we can't hear you sorry samantha you're

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,080
muted

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,559
we can't hear you whoops

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,559
there we go

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,840
um but yeah uh as expected uh it did

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,039
kind of meander between ten thousand

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,440
feet and five feet

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,200
uh which uh we definitely expected with

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,360
any metrics conversation

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,080
uh so we got into the weeds a little bit

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,120
and then we also kind of moved into

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,000
theory um and one of my main goals was

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,400
to focus on

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,240
the patterns and the trends uh that kind

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,280
of came out of it

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,400
um so before i kind of get into this uh

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,280
this doc one of my main goals was that

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,159
the doc would actually work as somewhat

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,400
of a

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,919
mediocre toolbox that would kind of give

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,520
you an introduction to a bunch of

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,559
different resources

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,480
uh for metrics analytics etc

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,799
the rest of the chaos community was

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,280
absolutely wonderful and helpful

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,799
uh in this talk so kind of before we get

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,240
into that i also want to say thank you

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,919
so much to them

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,320
uh still it was really well attended

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,360
and everyone was so active and so

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,400
engaged so

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,440
really really um powerful conversations

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,080
and i think it

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,960
kind of brought a lot out uh more

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,120
specifically

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,159
uh there were a lot of questions

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,159
surrounding

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,039
um what was to be measured by different

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,159
stakeholders

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,480
uh so obviously the ever so present

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,640
conversation about how you prove the roi

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,200
of community was what we started with

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,000
um and that kind of became a discussion

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,279
about

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,640
um these primary stakeholders may not

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,880
really want to know much about what's

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,200
going on in the community so much as

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,919
impact uh so how do you measure and

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,200
recognize

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:18,880
impact uh what are the vanity metrics

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,960
um that you want to avoid at what times

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,919
so there was a large discussion

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,360
specifically surrounding around that

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,880
and then kind of moving into that

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,679
there was also a question of how you

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,679
empower your primary stakeholders and

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,720
your community members to communicate

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,120
and integrate um by making the metrics

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,480
more

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,559
public um so how do you figure out what

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,600
tactics you need to use to get everyone

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,080
involved

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,279
as far as that goes donna you might be

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,279
interested to know that

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,400
a small portion of that discussion did

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,960
involve

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,760
metrics obsession um and helped

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,200
necessarily avoid that or move forward

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,520
um kind of moving forward from

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,720
the weeds however we also wanted to kind

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,400
of discuss

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,440
um making sure that they got

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,640
active uh in regards to thumbs up voting

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,960
features

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,799
uh net promoter score several other

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,799
features that allowed community members

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,600
active participation

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,240
so that we could determine that activity

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,480
and that use and that growth

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,039
without just relying on very vague

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,039
behaviors

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,640
and then another thing was um how

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,080
exactly

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,799
can we act on these metrics um

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,840
and that involved a lot of trusting

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,760
community members

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,200
uh just trust them to interact trust

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,720
them to do things

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,240
set um the precedent that something is a

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
thing in your community

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,840
based off of the metrics and those

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,000
metrics in them

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,400
of themselves will actively change the

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,520
culture just by virtue of saying

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,440
these are what we are measuring uh so be

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,480
very very careful with how you

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,600
interact those uh metrics with the

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,880
community

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,880
and um just kind of trust that that

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,880
precedent will set momentum

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,880
that sets the culture in the right place

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,159
so that you can finally

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,720
achieve a goal or an objective uh that

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,760
does

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,880
ultimately determine that roi

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,799
um so like i said it meanders

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,080
five feet to a thousand feet back down

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,400
to five feet so

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,120
i'm looking forward to a very strong and

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,600
robust

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,360
long-term discussion uh coming out of

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
the google doc i hope

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,799
yeah well thank you and that's half the

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,840
fun isn't it how it bounces

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,919
between those different zoom levels um

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,000
all right so i'll go last uh the session

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,559
that i was facilitating was

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
on how to build amazing incentives and

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,720
rewards

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,960
something that's captured my interest

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,159
for quite some time and i think it's a

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,679
really important part of how we build

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,760
amazing communities

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,640
we touched kind of a lot of ground in

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,000
that session uh we first of all

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,159
kind of really dug into the role of

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,159
incentives and and how we

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,200
use them to to drive the right kind of

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,880
behavior that we want to see in

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,640
communities how to encourage the right

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,039
kind of participation

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,480
and a lot of the discussion that we we

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,000
focused on was

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,679
kind of what what are the priorities in

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,520
doing incentives and how do you do it in

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,600
a way that is

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,880
is meaningful and isn't dominant and

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,760
isn't pushy

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,799
um one key theme that that really kind

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,320
of span through

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,159
or threaded throughout the whole session

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,440
was the importance of recognition

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,360
you know we talked a little bit about

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,480
the difference between extrinsic rewards

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,520
such as

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,279
bluetooth speakers and water bottles and

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,039
branded blankets and all that kind of

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,279
stuff um

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,320
and the intrinsic rewards of someone

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,399
saying thank you

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,840
and being recognized on social media or

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,360
in a blog post or

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,120
getting a shout out at a conference or

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,039
something along those lines and

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,000
um i was very interested to dip into

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,360
that particular element of the

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,279
discussion and there seemed to be just

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,279
universal

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,720
a universal perspective that the that

00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,360
recognition piece is really really

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,559
important

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,480
um and often a place where there are not

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,919
communities can often do a better job

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,120
you know even communities that are very

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,799
very engaging

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,279
cannot often structure that in different

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,320
ways we talked a little bit about the um

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,320
the different ways

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,159
of of distributing incentives um

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,440
i shared kind of the way in which i

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,480
think about it which is stated in

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,559
submarine

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,080
and then we kind of bounce between these

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,559
two different types of incentives quite

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,120
a bit

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,480
so just to recap briefly stated is where

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,200
you say if you do this thing you'll get

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,880
this thing

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,080
um such as if you you know if you um

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,360
have your question liked a certain

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,240
number of times in stack overflow you'll

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,760
get a badge

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,279
or if you participate in a competition

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,799
and you win you get the prize

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,159
and then submarine is where you detect

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,559
the behavior you want to see and then

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,760
you reward people with um

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,799
with some kind of recognition or or or a

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,559
reward

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:54,320
within the stated um incentives

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,080
domain there's quite a bit of discussion

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,320
about badges you know whether people

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,880
felt like badges were a good thing um

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,640
and how popular they were um a lot of

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,480
people seemed to quite like badges but

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,240
we talked about how

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,520
sometimes first of all not everybody

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,279
collects badges and

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,960
but a lot of people do and then they get

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,640
a bit bored of it

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,760
but they're a very popular way of doing

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,799
things we also talked a little bit about

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,799
the difference between

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,240
collecting badges and also having a

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,000
badge for example on your

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,840
twitter profile or your linkedin profile

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,960
that is more of an identity

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,960
and that there's a subtle difference

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,799
between those two but we talked a lot

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,200
about submarine incentives which is

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,559
uh surprise and delight and the term

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,080
surprise and delight kept being

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,440
reiterated over and over again in the

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,559
session because i think

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,559
it resonated with everybody um that

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,000
you know community members love to be

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,240
surprised they love to have that sense

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,200
of surprise and recognition

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,480
um what i forget my apologies i forget i

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,880
think it may be in katie you asked the

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,240
question

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,679
how do you how do you um

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,600
how do you deliver these submarine

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,399
incentives without telling people what

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,240
they are

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,440
and how can you use it to kind of with

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,880
people who are new

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,000
to your community so we talked a little

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,520
bit about how they can be applied to

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
onboarding as well

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,000
um and then finally just two other

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,520
things one is that we talked a bit about

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,520
swag and the importance of making sure

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,799
that it's inclusive and that membership

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,240
is inclusive

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,200
um in in in how you in how you engage

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,480
with people

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,480
and then we also talked a little bit

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,960
about the risks of gaming the system you

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
know

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,279
many of us will be familiar with the

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,440
crusty old forums of the 90s where

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,880
if you posted 500 posts in a row you'd

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,880
get some kind of

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,240
label and they could be very easily

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,000
gamed and what that looks like

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,360
today with ever more complicated

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,320
community platforms

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,080
that can still be gained so really a

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,919
really interesting discussion i think

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,559
just a lot of real fun stuff that we dug

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,080
into

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,520
um so thank you everyone for joining so

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,279
we've got about 10 15 minutes

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,799
before this session is going to end and

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,840
then just so everybody knows that the

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,279
wrap-up for the whole

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,600
ato event is going to be at 6 p.m

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,440
um where i'm assuming todd is going to

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,039
thank people about 1000 times this is

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,120
the most thankful person i've ever met

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,480
in my life

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,840
um is there anything just with the with

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,360
the moderators with the panelists is

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,480
there anything you wanted to dig into

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,840
just in this time that wasn't explicitly

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,760
covered or that you'd like you think

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,880
needs a little bit more unpacking

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,039
um while we've got this time left over

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,880
jono one of the questions that i posted

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:26,480
was how much time

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,240
do each of us as moderators have to

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,159
groom our documents and

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,640
you know kind of finalize it and polish

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,279
it before we present it

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,600
or share it more widely that's a great

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,640
question

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,399
maybe a week should we do that maybe

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,039
maybe if everybody not just the

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,919
moderators but everybody

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,559
who join the sessions who's inclined to

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,080
do so

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,159
can go in and help clean up the

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,320
documents and then maybe um

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,720
we can ask i don't have the attendee

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,519
list of ato but maybe we can then ask

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,960
see if ato can send a link to the

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,480
documents or maybe all

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,000
everything consolidating one document so

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,880
everybody can see it i think that would

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,480
be great

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,760
jono do you want attribution removed

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,960
from the chat logs i think that was a

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,559
question somebody else asked you should

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,600
probably do that i think

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,039
thanks gdpr violation yeah i don't want

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,039
to put anyone in a weight position

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,200
so yeah i mean i took the private ones

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,559
that were on to me out but there's still

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,200
attribution for the public ones which we

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,640
can take out right

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,000
yeah and and also attendees who are on

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,080
the chat is there anything you want

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,600
us to discuss for a few minutes that may

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,279
be relevant or we can always bring

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,480
people back in as panelists you know

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,840
there were there was a question about

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,519
recordings are they gonna

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,799
i didn't think we i know we were

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,840
recording but are they gonna be made

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,159
available

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,760
i'll be honest with you i have no idea

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,559
all things open are coordinating all of

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,919
the logistics

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,039
i'm guessing because they're usually

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,480
pretty good with the recordings i'm

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,120
guessing that those recordings will be

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,919
gradually

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,159
uploaded to youtube that's my assumption

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,320
i

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,159
i'm feeling a little remiss because if i

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,279
knew i didn't think about that i

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,039
probably should have

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,399
said we were recording at the beginning

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,000
so that people could

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,840
take that into account so i'm a little

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,279
bit i'm honestly i'm a little bit

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,399
nervous because i didn't do that about

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,279
my session

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,360
i don't think there was anything right

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,039
but it's a good point though dan

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,120
good point yeah i didn't even is there

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,559
somewhere that folks can reach out where

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,919
if they know they said something in a

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,320
session that they're now

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,320
panicking about um that they can reach

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,519
out and say hey

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,880
i was in this session i'm not

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,399
comfortable with this and maybe we can

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,399
look for that specific comment in the

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,480
recording and just

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,919
remove that 30 seconds or something like

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,200
that

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,159
so i'm going to write in here if you

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,960
don't feel comfortable with the

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,159
recording

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,960
feel free to email jono

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,440
and i'll put my email address in here um

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,039
and i'm happy to

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,640
i'm happy to share that and what i also

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,320
don't know is whether everybody signed a

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,000
release form when they signed up for ato

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,799
i don't know if that's the case

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,519
um i'm similarly for my session i'm just

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,240
van riper

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,679
my name at google.com if you we're in my

00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,080
session and there's something you don't

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,360
want

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,159
included just let me know

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,279
and and i'm happy by the way if anyone

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,279
if anyone

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,040
had any issues with any of the sessions

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,839
i'm happy to coordinate with

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,520
the moderators here so yeah okay you

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,720
know just so to reduce your work on the

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,839
moderator side

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,040
but yeah we want to make sure that

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,079
everyone feels comfortable with the

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,670
content this game

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,320
feedback is really appreciated

00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:27,359
[Laughter]

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,800
definitely yeah this has been a lot of

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,359
fun

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,240
um i have to say i was speaking

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,879
personally i was

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,399
curious to see how much this would feel

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,760
like cls

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,599
um and i personally it felt like cls

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,639
today it was different

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,000
um you know i've got shorts on right now

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,679
but actually i wear shorts

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,159
that's what we're talking about but it's

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,320
it's different but it's been um

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,520
i think once you got into the sessions

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,960
except for the difference with

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,800
not actually being in the same room it

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,240
was it was very similar

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,400
it felt like a the night kind of

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,000
conversations we've had there but

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,400
it's just not the same not having the

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,480
session board creation piece of it

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,480
yeah yeah as the person that runs that

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,440
piece of it i'm a little biased but

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,440
yeah no we miss you doing that man but

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,720
we also you know in person we don't get

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,680
jono's clicky keyboard which that makes

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,760
that makes the whole session for me

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,280
i didn't realize that people i wouldn't

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,240
mind if we used a tool

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,160
where more people had the grid because i

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,920
i feel like uh

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,079
like looking at your own face and the

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,839
person who last talked and nobody else

00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,480
is a little bit different than

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,680
at least looking at like 10 squares or

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,880
20 squares

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,760
um with some faces in them um and i

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,000
don't know but

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,280
either we could try and get zoom to fix

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,119
the browser version

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,160
for all the folks that can't download

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:56,079
zoom on their work laptop or whatever

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,280
um lisa i was a panelist and didn't see

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,240
it it's everyone who

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,040
is in on the browser oh the attendees

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,720
can see everyone

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,160
but if you're moderating it's really

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,800
hard because then you can't see who's

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,960
like

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,040
brimming with something to say and then

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,839
you're like huh i guess no one has

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,640
thoughts on that and there's someone

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,640
like you know

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,320
so that would help it feel a little more

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,920
like cls i think

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,920
maybe big blue button i know if jitsi is

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,000
depends a lot on your bandwidth at home

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,359
or whatever but maybe a hosted

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,640
big blue button that's more

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,920
yeah yeah yeah no i want to see more

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,079
faces

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,520
i agree with you i agree with you dad i

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,520
mean it's it's like being able to see

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,800
everybody makes a complete difference

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,680
um i just noticed what jamie wrote

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,359
the oasis staff present present hereby

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,000

00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,960
a spacecraft or a boat for that matter

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,680

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,359
making this all about my office is if i
