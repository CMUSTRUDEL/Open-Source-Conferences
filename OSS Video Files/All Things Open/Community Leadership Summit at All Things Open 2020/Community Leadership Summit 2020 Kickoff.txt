00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,080
amount going on when it comes to virtual

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,960
i've been to probably 20 virtual events

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,599
um since this corona buyers

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,279
pandemic kicked off so there's a lot of

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,000
online content out there there's a lot

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,480
of demand for

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
our time when it comes to a online event

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,239
so i really appreciate that you're all

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,600
joining us today um before we go on as a

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,360
quick intro because many of you won't

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,280
know who i am and i've been working in

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,239
community for about 20 years now

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,399
my easterly community at canonical for

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,239
the ubuntu project at github xprize

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,160
and i'm a consultant i work with lots of

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,680
different companies to help them build

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,600
communities and we started the community

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,440
leadership summit about 10 years ago i

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,680
think it was now

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,719
and everybody that you're seeing here on

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,199
the screen

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,799
and who's a panelist today uh who's the

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,000
moderator today has been very very

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,360
involved in community for a number of

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
years and in many cases have been

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,799
involved

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,560
in in in the community leadership summit

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,280
for a number of years as well

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,119
um so first of all before we go on i

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,360
want to say an enormous thank you to

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,200
to the all things open team um i first

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,960
went to all things open

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,119
about five or six years ago and i'd

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,400
never heard of this event

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,560
and showed up and i couldn't believe all

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
the speakers that they had a lot of

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,079
close friends and people who i know in

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
the industry were there and

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,520
not only is it a wonderful event but

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
also i've become pretty close friends

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,119
with todd lewis who runs the event and

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,640
todd is just such a genuine person he's

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,320
got an amazing team

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,159
and i know that for many of us it's not

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
just it's not just a conference anymore

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,280
it's it's an event that we all

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,280
we're all rooting for um so you know

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,159
having cls be a part of

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
of ato i think was was a natural choice

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,560
um

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,320
but also you know big thanks to the

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,040
oscar event that wraps it

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,600
you know closed its doors um fairly

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,640
recently

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,799
that's where our home for cls was uh for

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
many many years but moving forward

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,479
we're going to be part of all things

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,319
open so

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,520
you know every year typically we we get

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,319
together in person

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
you know when we meet um in a convention

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,840
center

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
with completely overpriced terrible

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,760
coffee

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,640
um and for anyone who's been to cls

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,879
before

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,959
it is the definition of a chewing gum

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,599
and sticky tape kind of event

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,360
um by design it's a bunch of community

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,319
dogs hanging out with each other

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,319
our goal here isn't to put the machined

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,760
perfect event on the goal is to focus on

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,400
what's what matters and that is the

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,640
context

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,160
that is the the discussion and the

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,040
engagement with each other

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,480
and one of the things that i always love

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,040
every year about cls

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,800
and it's nothing to do with me or you

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,480
know van has been involved

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,920
every year um attendee for the first one

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,440
and then um some kind of like stick got

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,800
pulled out and yanked him in and he's

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,360
been helping every single year and

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,680
amber's helped many many years as well

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,640
nithya's helped many man it's it really

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,200
is a team effort

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,239
um and but what i love about it every

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
year

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,800
is that it's it's one part interesting

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,599
discussions but it's just kind of one

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,400
part therapy

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,239
we hang out with each other we we share

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,319
each other's successes we commiserate

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,000
each other in our in our failures and

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,680
it's it really is a communal setting um

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,599
and i was honestly a bit worried about

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,440
how this is going to work

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,040
in a digital setting so i'm going to

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,720
talk a little bit about that but it's a

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,000
pretty special place and i think that's

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,680
one of the reasons why

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,280
it's had its longevity and again it's

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,720
got nothing to do with the organization

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,920
because frankly it's a very simple event

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,159
to organize

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,200
it really is it's the people who show up

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,319
up to it so

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,599
you know i'm hoping that we'll be able

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,560
to transition some of this into a

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,319
digital setting

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
now every year typically what we do is

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,920
we run this as not as a non-conference

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,560
and uh we we buy a roll of

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,080
a very large roll of white paper and we

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,760
annoy the convention center over here

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
because we stick it to the wall

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,720
and we get told off every year for

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
sticking it to the wall because we

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,879
usually forget the blue tape

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,560
um and what we do is people show up and

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,720
they volunteer sessions

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,079
that they're interested in talking about

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,000
and then we write them on these little

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,959
session cards and we stick them on

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
on on the board and van who is the

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,720
master session crafter

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
takes all of these different random

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,280
ideas and helps to consolidate them

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,639
together into into us into a schedule

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,720
that works well

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,759
um and then what we do is we get into

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,199
rooms and we talk

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,639
there's no presentations with the

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,880
exception of we used to you know we

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,720
typically have little keynote sessions

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,720
but it's all discussions so if you've

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,000
never been to cls before

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,800
don't expect that you're going to be

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,479
sitting in in you know watching the zoom

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
session like the keynotes today and

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,720
watching people

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,240
run through slides that's not what we do

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,600
we're going to get together and talk

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,919
we're going to discuss and we're going

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,400
to really explore these different topics

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,840
in detail now we would have liked to

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,360
have done this unconference approach

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,400
like we normally do at cls because you

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
know you'd show up to cls

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,600
at the beginning and to be there'd be no

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,759
schedule

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,039
we'd make it that morning but that was

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,600
going to be a little bit too difficult

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,280
to do in an online setting so

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,280
what i decided to do was to reach out to

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,880
some people who i've seen

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,919
be amazing facilitators at um at events

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,120
at cls

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,600
and to ask them to pick topics and then

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,840
to run

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,840
a specific set of topics so the format

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,280
of the sessions is going to be the same

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,639
it's just that we didn't have the open

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,720
on-conference piece because it's just

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,400
kind of difficult to do that online

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,160
so i just want to quickly introduce our

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,160
moderators here so um

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,520
you know these these folks are going to

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,600
be running the sessions

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,560
over the course of the day um we're

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,000
going to cover

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
each what each of the sessions is in a

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,600
second um but i just want to

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
introduce these folks uh personally so

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
nithya

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,720

when it comes to diversity and inclusion

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,639
and the corporate relationship between

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,919
excited about her session which is going

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,520
to be about connecting

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,000
developed teams and community teams to

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,080
other teams um

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,880
amber now if you haven't met amber

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,880
you're missing out

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,800
ambra is is one of my favorite people in

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,039
the world i'm

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,880
amber through the ubuntu community um i

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,680
actually worked with her

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,280
um husband pete grayner who worked

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,039
economical as well

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,960
and he said hey my wife is interested in

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,720
coming and participating in ubuntu

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,800
and i was like that that sounds cool and

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,360
little did we realize what this seismic

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
effect of

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
amber's impact on ubuntu was going to be

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,319
she just really

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,639
rocked the ubuntu community and then

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,759
went on to really build a pretty amazing

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,120
career and there's a call light right

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,240
now

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,880
which is a security company um deb

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,639
nicholson

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,000
many of you will know from open source

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,599
and free software

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,199
dev's at the osi right now she was

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,639
previously at the software freedom

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,720
conservancy and

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,479
just is not only a delight to spend time

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,479
with but is just a phenomenal

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,879
member of our community and one of the

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,960
most incredible facilitators i've i've

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,919
learned a lot of facilitation from dev

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,960
herself um samantha i've known again for

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,759
a number of years

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,759
um really really incredible community

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,599
manager and very deeply invested in the

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,520
metrics world and uh samantha's going to

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,879
be running a session later on metrics

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,840
and community health and i think that's

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,080
going to be

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,960
really incredible to see and it's just

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,639
been a real pleasure

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,400
spending time with samantha i learned so

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,599
much from samantha

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,160
um and then van van is google

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,720
van is very very into mindfulness for

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
example

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,319
so there's been a number of times where

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
i've wandered into a session at cls

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,879
and no one's talking and everyone's kind

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,960
of sat there with her eyes closed and i

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,000
i thought that van was setting up some

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,760
kind of

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,279
some kind of cabal to take over the

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,039
world but no it turns out that they were

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,680
just practicing mindfulness and

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,880
van keeps us all grounded keeps our feet

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,919
on the ground and there's going to be

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,120
talking about

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,040
about really health building healthy

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,560
communities not just in terms of metrics

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,720
but in terms of

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,080
being a human being so thank you all to

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,240
our moderators for

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,920
for helping to run these sessions now as

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,760
i mentioned earlier on

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,040
cls is intended to be completely

00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,760
discussion based so there's going to be

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,959
no slides

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
it's going to be all discussions so

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,680
you're probably going to be thinking

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,360
okay how do i do that

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,600
in a online setting zoom

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,399
which we've all got varying opinions on

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
well

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,160
what we're going to do is you'll see on

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,200
this on the on the ats on the all things

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,080
open schedule

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,120
each of the different sessions for cls

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
and you'll be able to go and join the

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,160
sessions

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,440
it's going to open up your zoom window

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,720
and when you open up your zoom window

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,080
you're going to see a toolbar that looks

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
a little bit like this

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,000
now what you can do is in the session

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,720
you can first of all use the chat and

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,720
you can participate there if you want to

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,160
you're more than welcome to just chat if

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,320
you don't feel comfortable turning

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,000
your your microphone on and

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,360
participating as a speaker or as a

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,720
panelist

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,399
you're more than welcome to chat there

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,600
and each of our different moderators who

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,240
are going to be

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,480
um running the sessions is going to be

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,160
monitoring the chat as well as welcoming

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,200
people to be panelists as well

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,839
or being able to speak um so feel very

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,959
comfortable

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,440
just typing and sharing but the other

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,000
option you've got here is you can

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
volunteer to come in and and enable your

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,480
microphone you can hit the

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,920
raise hand button or you can you can

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,959
mention it on chat

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,560
um so amber is going to be running

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,160
the other track i'm running this track

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,240
for the whole day um

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,000
if you want to be you if you want to be

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,839
heard then just

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,839
mention it in the chat or hit the raise

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,760
hand button um and we'll be able to

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,040
enable your your microphone for you so

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,600
you can come and participate

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,640
i think we would like to have as many of

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,079
you as possible

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,760
on mic if possible because it's going to

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,440
make the sessions a lot more interactive

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,040
what we don't want to do as moderators

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,320
is just be talking the entire day we

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,399
want to be really

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,079
probing and exploring and helping to

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,959
find other people's perspectives and

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,480
opinions

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
and to be very clear on that as well

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,640
just making sure that we don't all have

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,320
to agree

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,000
so we want to sometimes some of the most

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,800
amazing moments at cls are where we

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,040
disagree

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,399
and we explore people's different ideas

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,399
and of course long as it's on the

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,120
platform we've been respectful

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,000
um so if you've got any questions about

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,680
this

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
you can always reach out to amber on the

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,640
other track and thank you again amber

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,360
for running cls on on the other track um

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,480
or

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,000
you know i like to say i'm going to be

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,880
on this track a bit for the full day as

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,320
well

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,600
now the other thing as well is and i

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,240
sent this as a message to each of the

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,279
different

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,880
session moderators um we've i've created

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,920
some google docs where we're going to be

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,399
tracking notes

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,079
um and we'll be putting the links into

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,959
the google docs at the beginning of each

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,200
session

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,079
so this is a doc where everybody can go

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,959
in there and

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,240
and edit so first of all be nice don't

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,720
go and write mean things into the

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,279
document otherwise we'll get very angry

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,000
um then we'll probably set ban on you

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,920
and he's

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,279
he seems passive but he's actually

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,120
extremely

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,360
aggressive when he's being prevented so

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,160
uh we'll make sure that those docks are

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,760
open but

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,440
i'd love if you can go in there and

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,959
leave general notes and resources you

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,160
can see in the top section but

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,839
as you're having these discussions is is

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,399
where there are real moments of like an

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,079
aha moment a sense of like wow that's a

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,600
really interesting principle or a

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,360
concept or a share

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,000
then go and put those into the key

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,880
insights in there to the wrap-up session

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,440
um we want sometimes these documents can

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,920
just be

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,040
real really incredible incredible

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,560
sources of

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,760
of content so um we're not asking all of

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,120
you to go in there and

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,200
and write notes if you don't feel like

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,560
you want to but the more of you that can

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
go in there and share your notes and

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,800
share

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,160
feedback from the sessions that will be

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,279
wonderful because we'd like to be able

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,800
to share these documents with everybody

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,279
at the end so that everyone can go and

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,560
see

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,720
what happened in the sessions that they

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,399
missed um

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,000
another thing to note here as well is

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,560
that we're going to do a wrap-up

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,240
at 5 p.m eastern time today now this is

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,720
really really important this is this

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,800
isn't the usual conference wrap-up where

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,639
you know everyone thanks the sponsors

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,240
and whatever

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,399
this is where each of the session

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,760
moderators is going to show up

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,720
um and read out some just some key

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,839
insights and

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,160
key interesting concepts and

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,600
moments from their sessions so the cool

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,399
thing about the wrap up is that when you

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,839
go there

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,200
you'll be able to hear a little bit

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,560
about each of the different sessions

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,079
because you can only go to one session

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,320
at a time because there's two tracks

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,680
so you're going to miss you know frankly

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,200
about half of the day

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,279
so this is going to be a great way to

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,560
just get a download of some of the

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,120
things that were covered

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,959
throughout the day okay so um but

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,920
definitely make sure that you join

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,040
the the wrap up at 5 p.m eastern all

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,000
right so what i'm going to do now is i'm

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,959
going to go through each of the

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
different topics that we're going to be

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,760
covering today and

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,360
i'm going to ask our fearless

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,200
moderators if they can just provide a

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
quick minute long summary

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
of their session and what they're

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,920
interested in covering and then we'll go

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
from there so why don't we start off

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,199
with

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,880
with you nithia fostering and mentoring

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,880
new community leaders what are you

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,760
excited to discuss in this session

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,959
this is such an exciting topic jono

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,440
because

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,040
um open source while it's been around

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,839
for a long time

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,120
most community managers uh grew up

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,120
organically

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,560
and they picked up you know bits and

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,040
pieces of their role

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,160
through uh participation in the

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,600
community

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,800
and hallway tracks and conferences and

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,519
cls and and i think we need to do

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,560
a better job of fostering and mentoring

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,120
some of our

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,800
new people coming in because community

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,079
management is one of the most

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,040
critical roles in any project in any

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,000
company

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,040
and we need to invest in their education

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,199
and their support

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,480
in their mentoring and so i'm super

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,800
excited to

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,160
foster this communication and and

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,480
discussion if you will

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,519
on how we can do that better going

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,680
forward

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,120
yeah wonderful i think it's going to be

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,959
a really really

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,399
interesting session and and such a

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,519
prescient one as well because i think

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,680
there is

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,360
we need great leaders and sometimes

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,880
great leadership is not necessarily

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,639
intuitive and there's a lot of people

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,160
who want to be great leaders who

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,360
don't necessarily have the tools or the

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,800
support of the mentoring so i think

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,760
that's going to be really a really neat

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,959
session

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,800
now i don't have guys here guy you i

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,440
building diverse teams and projects and

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,839

this because i know that

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,839
as a leader uh this is a huge challenge

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,800
um and anybody who's tried to lead

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,440
communities or

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,480
or or teams uh knows that this is one of

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,160
those things that

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,759
you know you just have to kind of dig in

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,680
and figure it out and

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,360
hopefully we'll get some strategies and

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,000
and brainstorm some strategies to help

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,399
make this

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,920
a little bit easier for all of us so i'm

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,920
really excited to be here and looking

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,519

share this but he's delivered he's done

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,959
a number of talks at conferences about

excited about covering in this

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,399
hi there i am excited about this i think

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,040
it's so

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,639
often that we as community devrel teams

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,120
get focused on engaging with the

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,720
external community that we don't always

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,160
take the time that we need to engage

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,160
with our internal

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,000
co-workers our internal community at our

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
companies so we're going to be talking a

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,440
lot about

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,880
how do we do this how do we go about

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,360
connecting with other teams

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,240
what's the value in that um and then

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,079
also how do we make sure that we're

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,320
amplifying the work that we do and

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,000
really advocating internally for

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,000
the external community and making that a

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,519
part of our day-to-day job

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,520
wonderful yeah this is so exciting for

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,880
the conversation yeah this is such an

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,319
important conference i'm so glad that

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,600
you're leading this mary because

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,400
i know that you've spent a lot of time

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,000
as a consultant and in your current role

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,520
navigating this territory so i think

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,720
that's going to be a really interesting

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,760
discussion

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,360
um i'm not sure if we've got deb here uh

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,319
i don't think i am here yay that's deb

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,520
oh wait i'll sell video i think wait

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,559
nope

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,240
i clicked it and ah there you are i am

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,679
here oh look at that

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,080
i'm like sitting on your shoulder like a

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,679
little parrot um

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,440
cool so um we're gonna talk uh

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,200
right after this actually about how to

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,919
create a sustainable community

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,400
so um one of the things that i think is

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,559
really

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
uh interesting is that uh you meet

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,240
people with all these great ideas

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,760
and then it's sort of like then you see

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,400
them next year and like how'd that go

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,440
and it's like

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,960
oh and they got stuck somewhere um

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,480
it's not because the idea wasn't great

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,320
but sometimes it's just like the

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,120
organizational stuff is

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,600
uh you know it's it's a lot when you're

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,600
also

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,640
trying to make your great idea happen

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,480
and so

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,080
we're going to talk about like some of

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,440
the nuts and bolts that you have to get

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,880
in place and

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,360
some of the ways that you lay a

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,000
foundation so that you end up um

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,360
you know all still friends a year in and

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,160
everything like that

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,320
uh so i'm really excited to hear from

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,360
other folks uh what their experience is

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,919
what's worked for them

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,600
and uh for folks to bring like things

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,200
that they got stuck on so that we can

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,000
all kind of like talk about it together

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,559
and maybe

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,600
help them get over the hump so we'll be

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,039
there at noon

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,799
looking forward to this i think this is

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,000
going to be so interesting because this

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,000
has been a topic that i know

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,760
has been discussed quite a lot in open

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,400
source and free software specifically

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,200
and

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,080
sustainability when it comes to you know

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,240
healthy

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
moderation and healthy discussion and

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,440
that but also like where does the money

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,880
come from to help fund open source

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,840
projects and free software projects so

00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,760
it's going to be

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,080
that there's a lot of meat on that bone

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,760
um

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,039
all right so uh van creating a healthy

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,520
community culture you

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,080
all right can you hear me yeah all right

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,799
hey

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,840
so um as you could see that's a there's

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,760
a there's some uh

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,000
overlap between the last topic and this

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,720
one um i tend to think about

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,400
this uh this is a title they came up

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,840
with but i think about this more about

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
you have sustainable communities but

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,400
what about sustainable community

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,400
management or

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,000
sustainable community participation so

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
how do we support ourselves

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
and the community members that are most

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,320
active in the community

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,039
to to approach the work in a healthy

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,360
manner and

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,880
in a sustainable way for themselves so

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,400
it's kind of more the personal aspect of

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,440
this as opposed to the organizational

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,280
aspect

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,440
yeah well one of the things i've always

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,080
admired about you van is just like your

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,640
sense of

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,960
eq has always been through the roof and

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,559
i can imagine that's going to be

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,919
pretty prevalent throughout that session

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,200
so i think that's good but and i do want

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,280
to say though that as a

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,400
uh unconference session at cls what i

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,960
like to do at the beginning is ask

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,520
people

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,000
why they've come to the topic so you

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,000
know

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
we'll talk about whatever aspects that

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,960
you want to talk about of healthy

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,919
community culture not just

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,039
what i'm passionate about so yeah it's

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,600
your session

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,039
yeah yeah maybe you should run a session

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,360
where you just still sit there

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,600
meditating have you done that online yet

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
man

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,039
uh no but uh we uh i don't know that

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,559
we'll be

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,559
doing a lot of that in this particular

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,159
session right

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,640
that would be that'd be interesting

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,520
though if that's what people want

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,880
i'm happy to guide some that as well

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,679
right

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,120
all right and then we've got um amber

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,679
who's going to be talking about planning

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,840
and running

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,520
online and in-person events so what do

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,600
you think about this one amber

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,760
i think it's really important now more

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,000
than ever as we're all adjusting to this

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,000
um i refuse to use the term but anyway

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
we as we're adjusting to the way we have

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,080
to do events now

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,679
um people who you know we've all been so

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,360
used to doing in-person event

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,679
and we got the strategy down and our

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,440
checklist down but we don't really have

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,600
these really good checklists yet for

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
online events and then how do you

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,720
you know how what are the pitfalls that

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,880
you run into what are the

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,000
you know you can spend very little money

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,559
or you can spend

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,760
you know 100k plus on tooling for these

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,400
type of events so

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,159
you know what do you need and and

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,200
looking forward to seeing what people's

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,720
questions are

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,400
what you're struggling with maybe

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,159
there's an event you're looking to plan

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,159
in 2021 and you just

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,559
maybe want to go through that sanity

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,640
check and checklist for that so

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,640
really look as as others have said this

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,559
is your session as attendees

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,559
i'm just here to facilitate and take

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,960
notes and help everybody else take notes

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,280
but

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,640
i do have a great checklist that i'll

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,919
share at the end

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,919
of the day i don't want to share it

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,640
beforehand because i don't want to um

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,720
you know drive the conversation in a

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,600
specific way but i will share it at the

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,919
end of the day

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,679
um but yeah just looking forward to

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,520
seeing what what people need and

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,880
and where you want to go in 2021 with

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,880
your events

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,159
yeah no it's going to be exciting and i

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,520
know amber you're not going to brag

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,120
about this but i'm going to brag on your

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,760
behalf why don't you just tell everybody

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,400
about just

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,200
for a moment about z because amber just

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,760
ran an

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,679
amazing event called zeke week and it it

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,159
was pretty cool right

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,679
it was we we didn't invest in any new

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,320
tooling and we had

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,960
almost 1500 people uh view the sessions

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,400
we used

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,520
a combination of zoom and uh youtube

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,240
and we and slack and it was amazing

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,360
and we had so many discussions going

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,360
that it

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,000
considering last year in person we had

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,400
less than 200 people in this year uh we

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,559
had more than 1500 registers so it was

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,760
it was a really great event yeah pretty

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,039
remarkable stuff

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,640
um great and then next we've got

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,840
samantha who's going to be

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,559
all talking about measuring community

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,600
health

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,559
uh yeah so this is probably one of the

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,679
bigger issues

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,000
uh that any community manager faces um

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,159
on one hand you've got stakeholders in

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,799
business how do you prove the roi of the

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,960
community

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,200
why are they funding it on the other

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,440
hand you have a community that

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,360
needs more of a voice and more of an

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,080
understanding of what's going on

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,799
um so what we want to do is we want to

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,760
focus on

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,919
widening the conversation for how we

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,960
measure community health

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,640
kind of similar to what van was saying

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,240
we're not really talking about a

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,440
community as

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,360
a marketing ploy or as a small group

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,080
where you can put a bunch of leads

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,440
we're talking about organic real

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,480
communities

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,799
um that you are fostering building

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,559
and introducing um a bunch of resources

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,480
and technology and especially in open

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,279
source communities

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,360
there's a lot of priorities that have to

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,960
be managed and run

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,840
so how exactly do you create a metrics

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,720
journey that allows you to find those

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,600
specific metrics the specific kpis that

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,039
say

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,600
this is how my community is growing

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,240
whether or not it's going too fast too

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,320
slow

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,279
whether you should pump the brakes maybe

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,760
you should

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,600
pull over to the side of the road figure

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,240
out what happened

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,400
so this is all about expanding that

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,840
conversation to look at your community

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,760
as a socio-political um

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,279
group and figuring out what metrics are

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,960
actually going to matter for your

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,159
specific flavor

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,440
of connection yeah that's um it's going

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,440
to be really interesting and

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,720
one of the many areas where samantha has

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,320
spent a whole bunch of work has been in

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,880
the chaos project which has been all

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,679
around

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,760
and kind of settling on a little bit

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,520
more consistency when it comes to

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,919
measuring especially within open source

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,320
so lots of great experience there

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,039
yeah and we'll actually have um i'm

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,159
hoping

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,640
a few uh chaos uh community members

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,799
as well um but i hope you don't mind but

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,679
a small plug they are also available for

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,480
you to talk

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,039
uh in the sponsor booth uh with a little

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,279
bit more of an extended conversation

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,279
uh so you should see elizabeth the

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,240
community manager for chaos and then

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,159
uh georg matt um hopefully you'll be

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,360
able to meet us and we'll get a firm

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,840
grip on

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,720
what those metrics mean across

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,159
communities

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,320
and then what it's going to mean for

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,919
yours specifically

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,520
yeah perfect um and then

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,840
and then i'll i'll wrap up i'm going to

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,480
be facilitating a session which is about

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,880
incentives and rewards

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,840
i just find that um human beings just

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,480
psychologically

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,919
we're naturally attracted to incentives

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,039
um you know if you do this thing you

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,600
will get this thing

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,960
and they come in many different flavors

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,679
and i'd love to just have a session to

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,880
just

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,880
really dig into everything that's

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,640
connected to that whether it's um

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
what kind of what kind of swag do you

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,799
send out what kind of rewards do you

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,640
share

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,960
how do you incentivize people especially

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,360
in you know in digital communities given

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,440
that

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,039
so many of us are working from home um

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,720
and how do you identify what kinds of

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,840
behavior you want to incentivize and

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,080
encourage

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,520
um and then reward that appropriately

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,360
how do you do this on a budget

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,200
you know how do you if you've got a very

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,159
limited amount of money for your project

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,919
how can you

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,679
use it most wisely how do you measure

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,200
that effectively when you're

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,120
figuring out how to define those kinds

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,559
of behaviors i think there's a lot of

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,320
a lot of things we can really dig into

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,440
in that session as well

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,440
um well thank you again to all of the

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,960
to to all of our moderators all of our

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,919
facilitators uh

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,159
for taking time out of your day you're

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,760
all

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,679
incredibly busy people but you're all

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,720
amazing at this and i think i can't

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,360
think of

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,400
many people who wouldn't be better at

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,640
running these

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,440
at running these sessions again just as

happen

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:37,279
um i don't know if many of you um

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,720
have run online events or in-person

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,960
events before but

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,000
it's a lot of work to pull an event

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,919
together and

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,080
um todd and his team have done an

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,919
amazing job trying to get

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,760
trying to kind of hurt all of these cats

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,440
into one place online

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,200
so um and it wouldn't be possible of

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,799
course with with the with the headlining

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,640
sponsors over here

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,000
and then with the other sponsors over

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,200
here as well so i'm going to stop

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,760
stop sharing um

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,120
before we wrap up and we'll maybe we'll

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,559
get out of here a little bit early so

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,520
everyone can go and have a pee

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,840
and get some coffee uh any questions

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,080
anything to discuss before we

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,520
we wrap up today especially from the

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,039
moderators is there anything you wanted

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,480
to discuss

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,080
what's happening in the chat but i just

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,840
wanted to say like a couple of us shared

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,360
the direct links to our notes docs which

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,039
are currently empty but

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,559
the reason for sharing them is if you're

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,440
someone thinking you want to come to our

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,279
sessions

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,360
please feel free to throw topics in

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,960
there yeah or anything you want to share

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,120
in advance for everyone

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,640
especially when it comes to metrics um

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,240
because there are going to be some cases

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,240
where we might want to get into the

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,240
weeds because we might find a

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,520
general concept that we can pull out of

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,320
those weird

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,279
cornerstone pieces um so we want to make

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,960
sure that we can

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,039
get that set up and then i'll kind of

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,240
garden the duck to make sure that

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,799
we can have a nice ebb and flow see the

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,200
forest

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,200
and the trees yeah that's a great point

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,279
samantha the thing is as well as

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:06,159
also um just to be clear to everybody

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,679
um cls is always kind of a bit of a car

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,720
that's being built as we're running it

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,360
as we're driving it

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,720
so as we go through today if there's any

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,640
comments

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,880
any concerns any questions that you've

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,360
got about your attendance at cls

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,679
just let us know you know like we're not

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,679
we're not wedded to any

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,520
particular decisions when it comes to

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,960
the the day our number one goal here is

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,440
to make sure that it's valuable for all

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,440
of

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,120
our attendees and of course everyone who

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,960
you see on the screen right now

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,880
so you know if you've got some feedback

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,600
if if we're figuring out ways of

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,960
of running sessions better then let us

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,640
know and then we can make sure we can

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,039
share that with each of the different

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,640
moderators as the day progresses so you

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,640
know we're open book

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,320
again just as a reminder feel free to

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,399
chat in the in the chat if you

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,600
would prefer to be a keyboard warrior

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,679
but if you do want to

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,880
be you know unlock the power of your

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:59,760
microphone and join as a as a panelist

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,640
don't you absolutely feel free to to let

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,640
us know

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,919
um i think we'd like to make sure we get

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,360
your permission before you bring on

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,440
because these are all being recorded so

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,960
we can't just switch everybody on

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,960
um but we want to make sure that you

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,440
feel very very comfortable in joining as

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,520
well

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,760
but also with great power comes great

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,720
responsibility so please unmute yourself

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,840
when you start yelling at your dog

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,600
because there's always one

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,880
so all right um

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,760
i think i i think that's a question from

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,240
lisa marie

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,360
it's microphone only right no video i

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,279
actually

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,399
i think we can make you put you on video

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,480
if we make you a panelist

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,000
or we can just unmute your microphone so

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,200
you you've got either option we can add

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,520
you as a panelist as well

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,360
so so yeah

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,039
all right so with that in mind i guess

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,200
why don't we wrap up

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,080
we'll wrap up this session go get

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,679
