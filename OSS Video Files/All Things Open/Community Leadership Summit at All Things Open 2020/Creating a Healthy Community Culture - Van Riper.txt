uh welcome everyone i'm

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,360
my opening comments are going to be

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,320
short i want to leave the time up for

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,679
all of you

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,559
um in fact one of the first things i

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,880
want to do is well let me let me just

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,240
give a little framing i think before we

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,000
jump into it

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,119
um again just want to make sure

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,760
everyone's aware about the code of

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,600
conduct

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,279
i don't expect anything in this session

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
like that

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,840
kind of the opposite type of obsession

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,199
and one that i think would have that

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,760
kind of an issue but

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,640
even so um if you did have any issues

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,040
you could uh

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
contact info at all things open.org or

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
let us know

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,719
through sidechat here we can try and

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,760
deal with it right here in the session

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,280
as well

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,120
um yeah i actually gave some talks

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,600
related to

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,840
community professionals and how to take

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
do self-care for themselves and for the

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,079
other people that they work with

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,360
in the community uh i've done a couple

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,480
talks over the past few years the most

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,079
recent one

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,000
self-care still better together i put

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,719
notes in here from that

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
um but this is not the primary focus of

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,519
the event today but i think just as a

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,720
framing one of the things i would

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,400
often do in that talk is uh this is not

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,680
a mindfulness talk but there's a saying

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
in the mindfulness field

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,040
which is like um let me just look at a

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,280
near side

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,600
right if you think you don't have time

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,290
to meditate for 10 minutes

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,600
then you better meditate for an hour

00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,799
[Laughter]

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,799
and and the thing is

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,880
for me that's more of a kind of a

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
proverb thing than actually a

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,520
prescription and so what it's really

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,960
saying is it's not really talking about

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,640
uh meditation it's not only talking

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,000
about how long to do something what's

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
really saying is in those times

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,640
in our lives when we need to take time

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,000
for self-care

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
those are the times that we're most

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,119
likely not to give ourselves permission

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
to do so

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,439
and so what that's saying is trying to

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,799
say it's trying to give you permission

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,399
it's not trying to say to do more

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,119
it's trying to say yes it's okay for you

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,560
to take the time for yourself

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,640
and i think where it really comes into

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,520
play with community work

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,200
and you know how you can be a healthy

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,200
member in the community which helps the

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,319
community as a whole be healthier

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,599
is um realizing

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,280
that i mean there's there's just a ton

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,000
of information out there about self-care

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,520
and about

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,319
you know how to how to be healthy

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,319
both mind body spirit the thing is

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,680
it's easy when things are going well

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,959
it's but when things are not that's when

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
it's a challenge and unfortunately when

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
things are not going well that's when

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,640
you're least likely to give yourself

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,959
the permission to do the things that you

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,239
know already know in your head to do

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
so what i think where the community

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,280
aspect of this really becomes important

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
is

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,599
realizing the importance of having other

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,080
people in the community that are your

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,680
kind of accountability buddies

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,760
there is this commercial i think it's a

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,840
snickers commercial i don't like the

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,519
stereotypical gender and age

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,040
things that they use in them but i think

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,599
it was very appropriate where

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,599
the person is not acting like themselves

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,480
you know

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,159
young man and they portray him as like a

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,680
betty white

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,959
and like the friends give him a snicker

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,400
bar and then he like he turns into his

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,840
normal self and the point is

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
the friends are the ones that notice

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
when you're not doing well and can

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
actually

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,400
encourage you and actually give you the

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,760
permission to take care and so

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,879
uh without going too far into that uh

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,040
other stuff there and then just to give

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,040
one concrete example

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
around specific community work that i've

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,640
had to deal with recently

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,159
as i opened it up to hear what you all

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,879
are here for because you might come for

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,680
different

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,799
aspects of creating a healthy community

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,560
culture

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,120
we had an interesting situation in one

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,440
of the communities i work with where

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
there were a lot of microaggressions and

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,640
they were typically

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,680
microaggressions you know against people

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,040
without privilege

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,480
in the community and those folks

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,400
would felt it would be actually becoming

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,840
a burden for them to be constantly

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,360
reporting

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,000
these uh these uh things like uh

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,040
actually they felt called out because

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,280
they were the ones they're always doing

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,560
so one of the one simple thing we did

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,040
is we added an anonymous way to report

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,799
uh because this was an internal team

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,919
americans and the maintainers inside of

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,560
the project

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,400
an anonymous way for them to report uh

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,400
these types of microaggressions

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,759
and that way the people with privilege

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,600
who weren't actually the

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,280
uh taking the brunt of these uh

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,120
microaggressions could actually

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,440
respond to them and and the people that

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,639
were you know people that didn't have

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,840
the privilege

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,520
that didn't feel like they were

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,360
this was one more burden for them or

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,720
that they were being called out for it

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,800
and so that was just one really simple

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,400
way that we could kind of support

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,440
you know the well-being of maintainers

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
in the open source project by um you

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
know

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,280
some of the people that were taking more

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,440
of the brunt of that activity

00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,440
so

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,479
i kind of like to open it up to to hear

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,320
what others

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,840
like if there's specific topics i can

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
talk to a lot of different topics in the

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,759
space

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,880
but i'd also like to open it up to uh

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
hear what other people have to say

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,440
including their experience

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
uh in dealing and helping to make their

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,840
communities run more

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,840
in a healthy manner

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,320
one of the things that i like to do is

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,280
uh i like to

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,400
uh use susie nelson's comments on

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,240
self-disclosure

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,240
like that's what you should always be

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,199
going for you should always be doing

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,840
things that encourage

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,880
people to affiliate with their community

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,160
a little bit more

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,320
so that they're comfortable

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,560
self-disclosing disclosing

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,840
and that builds the momentum necessary

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,840
to substantiate a culture of

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
self-disclosure

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
that's great and i i i meant to ask if

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,650
there's anyone that

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,199
wanted to assist with note-taking

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,960
[Laughter]

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,759
that would be greatly appreciated the

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,800
document's open to everyone

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
that uh um go ahead samantha could you

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
uh

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
mention the name against susie who i

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,680
don't know the person

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,759
uh her name is susie nelson i'll

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,440
leave a comment um to her in the

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,880
resources in the notes

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
yeah i put it i put a little text in

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,880
there if you could link something there

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,880
that'd be great

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
i'll say something about having a

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,960
healthy community you have to be willing

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,680
to admit when you did something wrong or

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,560
when you're

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,800
weak in some way you know you have to

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,880
you're not perfect it seems obvious but

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,960
people are so reluctant to do that in a

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,400
group and when you do that you allow

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,840
other people to do for instance

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,639
i went to a service a large religious

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,360
service

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,120
where the speaker who was a rabbi talked

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,400
about her depression

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
and she talked very uh honestly about

00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,840
her

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,880
own clinical depression and a lot of

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,919
people thought it was too much

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,680
information but i thought it was

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,960
wonderful because she gives everybody in

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,800
the congregation

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,680
the right to talk about whatever mental

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,680
problems they're having

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,479
totally

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,759
the the the that's the i would

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,720
categorize in the area of vulnerability

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,240
and authenticity

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,479
you know when you as the leader in the

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,720
community uh model that

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,840
it gives other people permission to be

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,560
you know

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,560
to do the same

00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,800
[Music]

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
i've seen some things up above i don't

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
know who's

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,759
dropping these things oh that was you

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,319
actually

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,560
so that's probably the susie nelson

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,560
piece

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,840
yeah um i i actually created that image

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
full of

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,199
full transparency but it's something

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,080
that i definitely learned from susie

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,520
um she actually has an amazing uh

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,879
community management training over at

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,879
digital marketer that i recommend

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,599
actually i do have a question about that

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,960
and it's

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,599
a little bit more um my context is as a

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,360
manager

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,720
but i think it applies to communities

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,840
where

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,120
i try to sort of share some things

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,080
to demonstrate that it's a safe space to

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,599
share some things

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,120
but then at the same time i don't want

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,880
to be so like i bring the energy down

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,640
you know like in this case like a lot of

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,080
us are in california and you know

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,360
there's been struggles around

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,039
everything that's going on and then on

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,000
top of anything you know not having

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
clean air and

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,839
like losing daylight for a good day and

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,880
you know so i kind of wanted to

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,720
just make my team feel safe that

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,160
you know they could share it's it's a

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,200
struggle for some of them and

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,519
um yet i felt

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,600
uh like it was hard to keep a balance of

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,920
like then triggering it into

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,519
a 30-minute complaint session with

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,279
everybody and i i wasn't sure

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,880
like well maybe it's okay maybe that's

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,720
what they need and maybe like if the

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,720
community is together in a conversation

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,240
maybe they just need to to do that and

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,040
then you kind of create boundaries so

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,600
that it doesn't

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,440
continue on like endlessly and just sort

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,320
of bring that whole energy down

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,040
um so yeah i i don't feel like i'm an

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,680
expert on

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,880
how to work that but it felt like like

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,880
it was necessary to

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,720
say that that space was possible while

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,959
over also worrying that

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
maybe you open the floodgates and then

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,320
you

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,160
create the wrong tone yeah um

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,760
i would say that when it comes to

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,880
self-disclosure it's important to

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,240
recognize that

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,360
um there's a ebb and a flow to what

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,839
people prefer

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,680
in their communities based on the level

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,080
of communication that they're having

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,600
um so to kind of clarify that statement

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,120
uh when things are intensely

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,160
interpersonal and there's very little

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,440
structure

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,640
people seek structure um because it sets

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,200
that line

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,760
whereas when there's a ton of structure

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,160
people

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,959
feel worried about interacting and they

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,160
crave that interpersonal connection

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,360
so managing that dialectical tension

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,519
tends to involve a lot of

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,360
setting the precedent for when it's time

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,279
to be interpersonal and when it's time

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,440
to be professional

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,600
um so i actually created a rapport

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,760
channel in the vast majority of my

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
communities and then i create ritual

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,519
content

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,200
um around people communicating and

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,519
interacting interpersonally

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,600
which generates that self-disclosure

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,640
while not impeding on that highly

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,640
structured interface

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,040
helpful

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,279
and i do think it helps in modeling and

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,920
that you're kind of like in the

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,600
therapeutic uh like i statements as

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,519
opposed to like

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
bitching about other people or other

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,079
things how you're feeling and about the

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,320
things and stuff as opposed to

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,680
uh yeah because because the other stuff

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:15,839
can kind of

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:15,839
devolve into a whining session

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,320
um if we're also comfortable moving on i

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,000
am

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,760
actually really really curious about the

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,480
same question that was actually asked in

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,640
chat

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,959
uh it's about being a female project

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,600
maintainer in a field which is 99

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,120
male uh there's constant friction which

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,680
tends to get tiring

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,360
so i'm also kind of curious what other

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,200
people are doing in order to

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,640
approach those issues and make things a

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
little bit more welcoming without

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,519
necessarily being

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
so overt about it

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,079
what are the subtle things you can do to

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,519
kind of move that culture

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,519
i guess would be a good question

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,040
i kind of want to listen at this point

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,920
to the women's

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,920
experience here

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,000
i i can speak to this a little bit some

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,040
things that we did in a couple of the

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,800
communities

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,800
um you know anything from

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,680
uh like the allies workshops and getting

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,399
you know um some of the men in the

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,079
community

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,000
to take this allies workshop and learn

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,839
how to become a good ally

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,399
um not just to women but any minority um

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
you know inside of a community um the

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,399
other thing was

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,399
you know not just a um just to um

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,120
say okay we have these women in this in

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,399
this project and

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,279
and you know kind of um voice

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,800
or or you know raise them up because of

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,079
gender but because of merit and

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,600
making sure that that the merit is known

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,680
um and and that

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,800
you know maybe they're often unseen

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,639
because i know like

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,279
i'm not gonna go and and kind of

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,120
bang on the drum my own horn or whatever

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,200
but other you know my own drum but but

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,360
letting people see your mirror and what

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,560
you do and how you do it and and that

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,839
kind of stuff and the other thing is

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,440
making sure that

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,720
it's okay and i'm going to just say it

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,320
that it's okay for people in your

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,120
community called what it needs

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,399
to be called

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,240
you know we might have to beat that out

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,959
but i mean it you know sometimes you

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,639
just have to

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,480
you just have to do that when it's

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,519
called and call for and sometimes it's

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,279
those allies

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,639
that are the ones that do it you can't

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,240
necessarily do it yourself because

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,720
sometimes that

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,600
is seen as hostile but if if you have

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,079
people who are

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,959
in your communities that you know are

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,240
very versed

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,839
and um and understanding and know how to

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,760
sort of facilitate

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,680
through the conflict or just when to

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,240
pull somebody aside and say

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,600
knock it off like what are you doing um

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
you know and sometimes it's the rock

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
stars in

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,399
in a community that are the ones that

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,360
are actually you know

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,839
causing some of that friction so again

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,920
it's

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,279
it's having that relationship where you

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,959
can either you know

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,120
privately say something and they fix

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,000
themselves or having allies who call

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,480
people out

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
uh publicly and and sometimes that helps

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,240
that's just some of the things that we

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
did

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,240
early on in the ubuntu community um when

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,920
we had our

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,839
how to we had an adventure women's group

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,399
that really sought to bring in

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,399
allies and get them trained and and

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,880
there's a whole allies workshop that

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,600
that you can that you can do but that's

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,680
you know

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,680
just a little bit tip the iceberg on how

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:44,560
we handled some of that

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:46,480
i don't know if that helps or not

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,800
i did want to share one specific thing

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,279
we did that's directly related to this

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,279
um so

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,399
we had a policy that was pretty lenient

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,680
about

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,240
uh banning people for infractions

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,959
and so they got a lot of that's why we

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,480
had a lot of this

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,320
microaggression stuff and one of the

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,320
things that we did decide to change was

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,560
doing like the temporary ban like

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,680
immediately for people for some of these

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,959
more minor things

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,519
um uh

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,560
to to to make it less of a less of a

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,639
constant

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,680
thing for people and made it more public

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,079
that we were doing it because a lot of

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,519
times

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,519
we would have side conversations with

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,199
these people and then

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,279
in the public conversation you wouldn't

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,160
see that they were actually being

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,720
um that was being addressed so by

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,320
actually

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,199
um taking action

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,800
and and and not you know not giving

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,320
people a three strikes thing

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,000
coming up with a temporary ban kind of

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,560
thing to uh

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,800
that seemed to seem to lessen the burden

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,639
i mean lessen the frequency of it i

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,720
should say because there seems to be a

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,160
certain actors that were very frequent

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,800
at it

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,680
that would get a lot of almost negative

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
attention as a result

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,040
exactly i told him to just put in the

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,680
notes that

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,560
that was exactly effect we were seeing

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,560
evaporative cooling

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,600
i i think too the other thing that helps

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,959
is making sure that people know

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,560
that um that the discussion

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,600
is not a hammer you know like you're not

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,160
hitting people

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,120
over the head with a hammer just to have

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,160
the discussion

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,199
and that people feel safe um bringing

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,880
up any of those topics in a in a group

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,639
to make sure that it's a

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,560
i hate saying safe space but it really

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,600
is like making sure that people

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,720
can bring bring those topics up inside

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,880
of your community

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,039
and feel comfortable talking about it

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,079
not just with women amongst women but

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,240
um you know women um talking to to

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,640
everyone about it or or men talking you

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,120
know

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,480
so or however anyone identifies talking

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,520
about the subject right

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,160
um without fear and and so and so

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,760
often um we're made to feel like if it's

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,600
anything negative whether it's those

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,640
microaggressions or big

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,160
um issues with that sort of stuff then

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,080
you can't talk about it because you're

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,559
you're shaming somebody or you're

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,440
and it's not about shaming somebody it's

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,520
it's about let's be

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,120
aware of the issue so we can fix it and

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,880
if you're if you're not aware of it you

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,000
can't fix it and so many times people

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,480
are just afraid

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,480
to even make people aware of it you know

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,080
on a formal level

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,120
so making sure that those conversations

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,039
are okay um

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,480
to happen it sounds

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,480
easy but sometimes it's not

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,280
i will say another thing that we've done

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,480
with some of the communities google open

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,799
source communities we're trying to do

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,760
now is do moderate moderator trainings

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:11,520
there are specific groups that will do

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,240
uh uh these kinds i'm not gonna promote

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,720
specific

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,000
but they're easy to find out there um

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,280
you know and

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,520
that seemed to be really helpful because

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,440
a lot of us just having people

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,240
know how to

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,520
you know respond to these situations

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,320
because sometimes people don't respond

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,360
just because they're not sure how to

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,880
respond

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,080
and just having our moderators properly

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,080
trained seems to really help

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,120
answer do you have some trainings

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,880
available i'd love to add them to

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,880
the notes on that note

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,679
that would be great

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,360
i guess i guess it'd be okay i mean the

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,880
group we've worked with

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,640
with sage sharp is the people we've been

00:18:52,880 --> 00:19:00,559
working with but um

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,440
um i also wanted to add that um

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,080
sometimes i try to pull it away from

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,160
gender

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,919
that's hard because we live in a world

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,559
that's so

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,280
binary in force every hour of our life

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,280
you know and

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
i don't wake up every morning going i'm

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,760
assigned female

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,400
you know like it's the world that keeps

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:22,080
reinforcing on me you're assigned female

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,120
um even though that's not how i exist

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,280
and similarly right i think um

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,720
especially in tech cultures there's

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,640
often this thing that

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,160
oh just because there's a bunch of

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,559
people who are assigned male

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,000
that they're happy with the certain

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,799
types of behaviors that

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,960
get manifest and so it's often around

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,880
then this larger context where

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,480
we've been in different companies and

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,559
different communities where

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,880
um you know even the

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,480
engineers are struggling to find a safe

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,679
space to ask

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,400
questions to be able to learn um in our

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,400
company

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,520
like and previous companies have been

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,280
with like

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,440
you have to actively work to

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,039
say it's okay to ask questions quote

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,039
unquote dumb questions there's no

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,120
such thing and yet it's not something

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,919
that once you say it it's fine you know

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,919
you

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,120
you have to like keep demonstrating it

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,840
and keep um

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,039
making that space because basically

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,120
everybody's hurting

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,320
too right i mean some people are getting

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,919
more perhaps

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,280
um overt aggression but i think

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,960
you know once you start talking to

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,039
people a lot of them are like yeah i'm

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,120
i'm not happy with the behaviors i'm

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,559
seeing or i don't feel safe and then you

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,600
know you're hampering innovation and

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,480
you're hampering

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,480
collaboration and such too so um you

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,799
know if anybody has

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,799
uh experiences there outside of just

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,880
guardrails but like

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,799
more of understanding that you know it's

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,480
not just uh

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:55,919
the genders that you see but the the

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,480
way it impacts everybody

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,120
i hope that makes sense i'm not sure

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,200
yeah

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,720
i really like what you say there and for

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,440
me it goes back to

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,880
encouraging self-disclosure um like

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,039
people are not going to tell you

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,919
that they're feeling uncomfortable

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,360
unless there

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,280
is an environment where they feel

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,159
comfortable self-disclosing

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,600
um so using community infrastructure in

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,240
order to encourage that

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,799
as well as interpersonal self-disclosure

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
yourself

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,240
in order to kind of set that trend and

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,240
get people to actually tell you

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,320
yeah i was just talking to a friend who

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,720
shared a story where

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,320
they had some kind of meeting that was

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,159
supposed to be about diversity

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
and of course like the only people who

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,120
were like assigned female

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,200
there was like two of them and then it

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,480
was like everybody else and then they

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,320
proceeded to

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,400
like say kind of outlandish things on

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,960
how inclusive or diverse they should be

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,480
and like not even like asking the

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,880
general people what they thought and

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,000
then

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,840
um so this friend who's assigned female

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,240
kind of talked to a group of the men who

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,400
were all really unhappy about it and

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,840
she was like why didn't you speak up and

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
they said i should have i should have

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,640
spoken up

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,919
and you know i think that that says so

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,440
much not like oh

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,600
those guys were cowards or whatever it

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,960
was like it was such an

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,000
unsafe space there's so much noise and

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,400
you know aggressive

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
kind of talk that the people who you

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,440
know weren't

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,559
in agreement just felt so completely

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,520
unable to say

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,120
hey you know i don't i don't want even

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,720
this conversation to continue

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,400
and also the assumption of the people

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,080
who are really loud we're like oh

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,840
we assume you're assigned male so you

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,039
agree with us and your silence means

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,400
that you do agree with it you know it's

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,600
just like this whole

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,000
toxic culture right that can um in a lot

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,039
of ways

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,039
is the is frequently reinforced so

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,400
it just you know you have to like keep

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,120
working at

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,760
um everybody's safety and then hopefully

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,080
you'll find

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,120
more people who can speak up regardless

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,080
of their assigned gender

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,080
just one example

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,440
i think another way of making it hard to

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,000
participate in the community

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,880
is just to assume that a standard

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,799
american

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,240
male white culture is is the culture and

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,559
and other people have to do a lot of

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,240
code switching i happen to talk to a

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,880
child of mine who is

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,159
non-binary identifies as non-binary and

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,039
they were talking a lot about code

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,600
switching

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,559
and uh i never have to do that well i

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,799
have occasionally

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,760
if i'm with a group of women especially

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,679
in

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,840
some kind of issue that's considered a

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,600
woman's issue i may have to do some code

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,240
switching but usually i don't have to

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,080
but it places a real big mental burden

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:50,950
on the women or the people of color or

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:55,890
whoever has to do it

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,890
[Music]

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,279
i feel like diversity is absolutely so

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,039
huge that we could easily like go on

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,880
about it the entire time

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,400
um but if you don't mind i do have

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,520
another question that's kind of

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,960
unrelated if that's okay

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,760
i think i'd like to yes please

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,919
um one of my biggest questions um that

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,880
i've been struggling with a lot recently

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,679
um i am a part of a mainstay community

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,000
where

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,840
the more powerful stakeholders tend not

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,880
to allow for autonomy

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,840
of people who are lower on the rungs one

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,720
might say

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,039
um so how can i increase that autonomy

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,440
and

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,600
build buy-in for people who have really

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,799
great projects and really great ideas

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,520
and feel comfortable championing them

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,840
in a community where veterans tend to

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,039
have

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,440
more power than uh newcomers

00:24:51,039 --> 00:25:01,440
and those newcomers feel disencouraged

00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:03,520
to participate

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,159
you're only asking easy questions

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:10,080
[Laughter]

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,600
um being a little bit selfish because

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,480
this has been like one of the bigger

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:18,240
issues that i've had to deal with and i

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,520
i haven't found an answer for it

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,480
so i i i don't i mean every situation is

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,960
different

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,200
i i can't say i've seen someone that i

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,320
work with do this well

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,559
um she has high trust with

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,480
those people in our project and she's

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,480
been really good at getting them to see

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,880
you know how they can have more impact

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,760
by in other words you know like

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,400
they're the bottleneck right because

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,960
right

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,600
and um i don't know if they this i see

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,520
themselves as a bottleneck but like

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,799
uh and i actually think that

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,440
you know i think it all comes down to

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,960
trust right because i mean i think they

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,960
i'm sure that even these people say that

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
have high their like

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,159
control there are probably some people

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,799
they do trust and

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,360
allow to take on certain things but the

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,960
the

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,279
probably circle of people that has that

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,360
trust with them is probably small

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,120
so i think it's the challenge is

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,080
building that trust

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,200
because everybody now in this day and

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,720
age usually

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,400
you know is over you know has more on

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,679
their plate than they can handle

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:34,559
and so if i think if i had the

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,679
trust relationship then then um

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,840
then that would i don't know if that's

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,840
making sense or not but

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,559
i've seen that i've seen that work on a

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,600
project that had that dynamic

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,600
that i've been involved with

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,440
so it's kind of an allyship kind of

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,960
thing in this case it was a woman

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,960
actually doing the ali ship thing but it

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,000
was someone had high trust with the

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,520
people that um had control of the

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,480
project and she was able to get them to

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,720
see

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,679
and get them kind of kind of used her

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,880
trust with them

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,600
to get them to trust other people

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,600
to get involved

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,960
and the other thing is a no-brainer

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,640
everyone probably knows this is like

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,679
then it's important that when you do get

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,600
them to

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,120
other people involved that they you know

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,480
come through you know that

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,159
that they see them adding value so i

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,360
think a big part of it is getting uh

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,320
people having shared shared goals like

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,120
if they know that you should have a

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,760
shared goal

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,120
then and and they see that you're

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,559
because like someone can do work but

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,000
maybe they're working

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,919
towards a different goal so it's not

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,200
really helping them but if they see that

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,039
you understand their goals and you're

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,640
supporting their goals and they see you

00:27:49,039 --> 00:28:03,520
making progress and it's helping their

00:27:50,640 --> 00:28:06,559
effort then it's kind of a win-win

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:10,159
yeah i i i really like that um

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,919
the idea of getting uh stakeholders that

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,799
have power to recognize that there are

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,200
shared goals

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,159
involved in the new projects below them

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,840
um

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,840
i think that that's a really really

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,360
powerful idea and a powerful trend to

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,760
make sure that that commonality is

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,760
mentioned

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,360
i'd also love to hear other people's

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,600
advice

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,000
if that's also possible just making sure

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:45,840
that the community culture is capable of

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:45,840
resolving that issue

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,440
i guess the thing to do is to test the

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,720
waters and see if the person is open to

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,840
feedback

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,279
um and you kind of get an idea

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,760
and if they are you can and if not i

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,559
personally i mean my approach is to sort

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,919
of like leave

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:22,720
that community you know if i can um

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,159
because you just can't if you're someone

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,679
who's like

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,520
not as powerful you can't really do

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:32,480
anything except you know

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,480
sort of get hurt along the way so

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,880
curious i don't know switching gears but

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,799
van i know you've been doing a lot of

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,679
mindfulness work for many years

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,120
um i've been spending my last several

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,120
months going through what's called a

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,840
mindfulness based stress reduction

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,320
program

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,080
which is an eight-week program that a

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,279
lot of people offer and there's one site

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,559
that offers it for free

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:17,360
so um i just finished it and then

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,960
starting it again and um i feel like

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,640
i'll just keep doing it until like the

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,039
things really start to click and

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,480
start to work and um since you've been

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,080
doing it for a lot longer

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,679
have you tried any of those practices

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,520
to bring them to communities for all

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,240
these various topics that

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,080
we've been talking about like are there

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,840
any tools that we can use even if we're

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,080
not like uh well versed in mindfulness

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,320
that would at least help us to be

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,559
grounded when these types of situations

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,559
happen

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,440
yeah it's uh uh

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,039
it's it's yes and no

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,559
because it really really comes down to

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,960
the individuals you know it's like you

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,120
have

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,080
uh you have to be careful yeah like

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,279
you know i wouldn't like come into some

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,720
community kind of

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,559
zoom eating and say let's all

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,760
be silent now for the next two minutes

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,760
or whatever

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,840
you know that that might be like that

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,360
might be someone's worst nightmare

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,080
joining the call you know thinking more

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,000
like um

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,600
because at least a lot of what i've been

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,720
taking in is like

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,320
you know being aware like not trying to

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,919
change yourself but being aware when

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,000
you're like

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,360
so you see something and you need to

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,760
respond

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,200
but you realize like oh i'm responding

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,440
with a lot of judgment

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,399
and like thinking like okay like how can

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,399
i try to be

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:50,320
objective perhaps or you know maybe you

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,480
somebody said something and you notice

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,640
like you're kind of triggered

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,000
because maybe other things so that when

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,360
you do respond you're not really

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,799
responding cleanly

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,399
to what that person said but instead you

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,840
might be bringing in some other things

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,279
that's not going to help

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,440
the situation might even escalate it um

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,120
yeah again it does it does come down to

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,159
like being aware that you're triggered

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,960
because a lot of times

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,600
when we're triggered without a lot of

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,080
practice

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,480
we you know we're uh

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,360
we're responding unconsciously before we

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,360
can actually

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,240
you know recognize it but if you can

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,480
recognize it then of course you know

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,360
what i i try to do is if i think that

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,120
the email i

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,600
try to take a breath before i hit the

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,120
send and if i'm still not feeling

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,880
that great about it maybe i'll talk to

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,200
somebody but else will share it with

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,559
someone privately before i send it

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,559
you know but uh

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,480
yeah it's uh

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,080
i don't have a nice simple answer for

00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,919
you

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,200
of on my end like i don't really have

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,760
any experience in any way with

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,720
mindfulness necessarily but i found that

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,559
um one of the most helpful ways for me

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,720
to make sure that my um

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,679
engagement in a community is personally

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,080
healthy for me

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,679
on a mental and emotional level i have a

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,039
lot of anxiety

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:20,559
um is actually just radical candor

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,679
um just being like hey listen my anxiety

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,640
just spiked

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,000
here's why can we talk about this and

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,799
just kind of fighting through that

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,600
and i find that the open conversation i

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,000
like to talk

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,760
obviously but the open conversation

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,360
really really helps me maintain a

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,120
certain sense of

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:53,840
understanding about my place in the

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:53,840
community and what my role in it is

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,760
i'll respond that um i've actually been

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,399
um debating about whether or not to join

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,399
um

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,039
a community not not an open source

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,120
community but just a community

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,599
that is primarily black and i am white

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,040
as you can see from my picture

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:17,200
and i've done so much mindfulness i then

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,560
mindfulnessed myself out of the picture

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,679
um because i i had been debating joining

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,040
the community

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,159
uh prior to the protests and then um

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,480
once the protests happened everybody

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,560
jumped on the bandwagon

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,679
um and so i was then afraid of

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,560
being seen as um

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,079
like and not to equate the two but sort

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,040
of like when people join a gym in

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,399
january

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,560
like i didn't want to be one of those

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,119
people that joined and then

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,879
they just assumed oh i would i would

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,800
walk away later

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,359
um so i sort of like mindfulnessed

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,760
myself right out of the situation

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,599
and and jumping off of the radical

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,640
candor actually somebody

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:05,119
a black woman recently suggested to me

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,240
you should just be radically candid with

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,640
with it like

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,079
you really want to be there you've

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,560
thought really long and hard about how

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,480
to join the space but you're afraid

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:20,240
um and so what can i do to help

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,839
um so that was sort of a connection

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,680
between that radical candor and the

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,720
mindfulness sometimes your mindfulness

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,560
can go

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,560
awry so to speak

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,720
thank you for sharing that

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,440
i guess i just one more suggestion that

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,720
i have that works for me now is to just

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,119
take a step back

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,760
like take a step back for a day three

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,480
days

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:59,839
a few days that can really help

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,839
with difficult situations

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,400
i think it's kind of like the joke that

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,480
van started with

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,079
like if you can't meditate for five

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,280
minutes you need an hour it's like if

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,280
you feel like

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,839
you want to like respond to something

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,520
really quickly

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,320
maybe

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,359
and i actually i do a lot of um like

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,440
i'll write

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,359
the email that i know i'm never gonna

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,880
send but i need to just like

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,240
you know and write it obviously slightly

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,720
so it doesn't mistakenly get sent but

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,000
sometimes like you need to like

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,520
um write a response or you know whether

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,200
it's in a chat room or something

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,200
and let it sit so that you can be

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,480
present to what's going to be the most

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,320
helpful response

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,000
yeah it really depends on the situation

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,720
because some situations it's best to

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
just not respond and then

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,560
have someone from the community

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,560
responding

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,000
but then there's some situations where

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,359
it really needs

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,240
your authority or whatever uh

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,040
to weigh in if i'm being too honest and

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,240
this is like

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,520
a big a mission on my end i have

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,560
explicitly

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,720
refused to open an email that i know

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,800
is incredibly time sensitive like i have

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,000
to do something in the next 15 minutes

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:37,839
i've just refused to open it for 10

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,839
just to give myself the breath

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,960
so so i'm actually looking at time and

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,400
believe it or not we have about five

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,520
minutes

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,640
i think we're supposed to try and wrap

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,960
up at the 45 minute mark of the hour

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,960
um

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,200
i'd kind of like to talk about what we'd

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,800
like to share from this session

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,640
back to the larger group in the five

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
o'clock uh share out

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,480
yeah feel free feel free to put things

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,480
in there you think from the session

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,839
you'd like to see shared out

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,839
and uh

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,280
you can also verbalize it if you want

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,599
and one of us will capture it

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,079
that way you know after you after you do

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,079
that too

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,160
do you want it highlighted in the notes

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,320
well there's a key inside section at the

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,280
bottom so if there's

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,560
something you would like uh to be called

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,800
out there

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,400
i've also been filling out notes but um

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,599
just to kind of point you back toward

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,680
there we actually do

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,760
have the questions that were asked some

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,400
of the answers i've actually copied and

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,640
pasted some of our chat interactions

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,000
um and in addition to that there's

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,480
several resources

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,440
specifically on mindfulness uh that you

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,920
can find

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,920
uh in the document as well so kind of a

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,760
souvenir to take home

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,280
oh i just wanted to add one more thing

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,480
someone in the chat said

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,200
email is so anxiety inducing like i'm

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,280
old enough

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,280
for back when we didn't use email at

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,839
work like it had just come around and so

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,560
you would

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,320
talk to people at work you know people

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,160
didn't work remotely and you just would

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,680
go to their office or cubicle

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,680
and chat and back in those days i feel

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,079
like we didn't experience as many of

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,800
this

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,280
like tension or conflict via email or

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:45,040
these misunderstandings that go on

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,359
so um i do this a lot more now with

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,520
my co-community managers whatever it's

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,280
up is like just to get on a quick phone

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,280
call where i'll be i'll be like

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,960
uh can we talk for five or ten minutes

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,760
and then keep it really keep it to five

00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:11,839
or ten minutes

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:11,839
and have that call if it's doable

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,640
i'm not this helpful but um another

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,000
thing that i do with my um

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,839
i have kind of like an accountability

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,480
group and some of us

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,280
took this improv class a while ago and

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,440
it was sort of

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,880
applying improv skills to real life and

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,280
they would end each one

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,480
with a conversation practice and people

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,640
could um

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,000
practice either conversation that they

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,920
had and as often with a

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,200
colleague or it could be with a family

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,520
member but yeah

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,720
it didn't go the way you wanted or maybe

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,359
you're not happy with the way you

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,240
responded

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,599
you didn't know how to respond um or

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,480
maybe you have a conversation that you

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,000
need to have

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,880
but um you're uneasy about it and um

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,920
we would go through two rounds where um

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,960
you could practice

00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,079
the conversation in a safe space

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,160
and you could play one of the people

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,920
or other people in the group could play

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,800
the people and um and then the rest of

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,680
people would observe

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,960
and so you do this kind of role playing

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,760
and play it out

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,440
um and then uh people then would comment

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,040
on like what they observed and so it was

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,200
both really interesting to

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,359
see how other people who often aren't as

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,079
emotionally emotionally um

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,680
charged by that scenario um play out

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,400
either you or the other person

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,599
right um and then uh it's interesting to

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,960
see how people read

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,319
like the body language in very different

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,160
ways either they thought it was more

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,319
aggressive or less aggressive

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,760
and then after that you do it again and

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,400
so other people

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,960
might play the roles and so you get to

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,040
observe

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,200
how people deal with it in very

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,720
different ways and

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,160
i think it also brings up a lot of

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,079
empathy when you see how things are

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,640
going or you see it kind of away from

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,960
you

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,560
um and that's something that i've been

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,040
doing with my friends like one friend

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,119
was

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,200
needing to negotiate her pay and she was

00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,640
really uncomfortable about it and after

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,560
we kind of created the worst case

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,560
scenario for her of course real life was

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,599
much easier so she just felt prepared

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,160
and she felt more

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,359
you know able to engage and so anyway

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,839
it's just something we've been doing

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,560
it's been

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,920
incredibly helpful that i helped think i

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,440
i think like

00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,200
difficult conversations are difficult

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,680
often because you don't know what's to

00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,720
come or

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:31,839
you don't feel like you have enough

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:31,839
practice so something to do

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,880
other key insights i want to make sure i

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,880
don't miss any

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,839
um like what's the one thing that you

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,839
think you're going to take from this

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,839
talk

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:59,839
that other people are experiencing the

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,839
same challenges

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,960
i guess for me i feel the safety is such

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,800
a

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,880
cornerstone like making sure that

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,000
the goal of the community's safety and

00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,359
that

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,760
guidelines are around safety um

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,839
otherwise why have a community where

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,480
there's no safety

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,480
why bother you know at least for me

00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,000
when that's when you say safety you mean

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,440
kind of like in the way like the goo

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,440
like in the google study where they said

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,880
than teams like the most important

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,680
factor for effective teams with

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,359
psychological safety

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,800
um i'm not familiar with the study but

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:54,160
i just was extracting from the

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:56,319
conversation okay all right

00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:09,839
i think i'm just kind of mapping my

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:09,839
world onto what you said

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,560
now if you don't mind when i share i

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,599
think with for the respond versus react

00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,319
i think that's where i'll bring the

00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,960
mindfulness in because i think

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,520
uh it's not something you can just kind

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,520
of

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,440
decide to do but if you if you have a

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,560
mindfulness practice it will

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,839
it will help to make space to be able to

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,880
respond rather than to just react

00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,680
unconsciously

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,240
over time it's one of those things where

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,400
we know

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,280
that we want to be not just react but

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:51,839
it's a lot easier

00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:51,839
to say than to do

00:44:54,970 --> 00:45:03,440
[Music]

00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,560
i'll i'll look for this say sharps

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,560
consulting

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:12,160
link later to add resources

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,400
yeah actually just so folks know sage

00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,920
i just discovered because my community

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,280
was supposed to contract

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,839
with them um is no longer doing that

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,359
work

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:26,400
oh that's that's news yeah

00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,200
um they were contracting with us and

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,000
they

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,520
um told us that they are getting another

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,119
a permanent job and so

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,400
if anybody knows of anybody else who

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,400
does that work please let me know

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,720
that was a definitely a good time to

00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,160
share that particular resource postcode

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,480
like right now yeah

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,440
that that was very we were pretty

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,119
disappointed

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,359
because we heard some really great

00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,000
things about sage so

00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:02,160
do you mean the the otter technologies

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,800
or is that something else

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,280
yeah yeah yeah that's definitely because

00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,040
i just

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,040
received an email from them yesterday

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,040
today with new code of conduct trainings

00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,640
they may be doing code of conduct

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,119
trainings but the consulting

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,680
stuff we were told they're not doing so

00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,040
ah

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,480
okay that makes more sense because yeah

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,160
i thought we i also thought we had a

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,200
contract with them to do more

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,200
code of conduct trainings

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,280
to it could be that they aren't taking

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,640
on new clients for code of conduct stuff

00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,119
probably because google filled up the

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,119
calendar

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,760
the training

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,640
i don't know i don't know if that's the

00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,680
case oh it said i should just blame

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:56,800
google

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:58,880
that's great

00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,839
cool so at the top of the hour do we go

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,119
to the

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,599
wrap up yes uh

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,520
we're technically at time now and uh

00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,839
it's the other

00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,560
well if you go through the all things

00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,400
open site

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,920
the the thing that takes you back to the

00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,280
to the closing

00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,200
it's a different zoom session than this

00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,640
one

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,720
so you'll have to leave this one and

00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:25,040
join the other one

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:27,760
at the top of the hour all right see ya

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,559
so yeah so thanks every thanks everybody

00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:34,480
for attending uh today's talk

00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:38,000
and as uh van said we'll head on over

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:41,440
to the closing uh session at five

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,540
over on track one so thank you so much

00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,880
thanks everyone

00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:48,400
[Music]

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,440
thank you so much and sorry about my

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,079
huge amount of conversation but i really

00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,240
really really

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,520
loved this like i i got a little bit

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,839
carried away but

00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,280
thank you well that's what these are

00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,440
supposed to be you're great

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,880
yeah you were great i it was going to be

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,480
a pretty quiet i didn't really want to

00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,119
make it a mindful just a mindfulness

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,599
session

00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,640
i mean so i'm really glad that we had

00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,559
other topics

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,720
so thank you i agree i think that um

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,880
like mindfulness is incredibly important

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,599
but it's one of the areas that i

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,160
lack the most like uh as a community

00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,040
manager

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,720
the spot that i am the worst at is being

00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,880
a community evangelist

00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,240
um so it's really really difficult for

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,680
me to have all those interpersonal

00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,440
conversations

00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,839
and i think that this was very very

00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,599
helpful

00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,119
i think i think i probably could have

00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,400
mentioned was the mindful listening

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,920
because i think that's one thing that

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,599
you don't have to have a mindfulness

00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,400
practice to

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,760
to to focus on that because like if you

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,680
can

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,079
work on being more of a mindful listener

00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:53,680
with your community that will

00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,000
yeah that goes a long way i tend to be

00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,880
so

00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,240
task oriented and so uh focused on

00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,599
building the architecture

00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,359
and making sure the systems are

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,760
supporting conversations

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,359
i tend to pick take a back step so

00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,240
oftentimes what i'll end up doing is

00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,200
i'll just train

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,880
facilitators who are very clearly just

00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,520
naturally better at that interaction

00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,440
than me

00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,040
and i'll just be like here's the

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,160
institutions

00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,640
here's the system now go

00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,359
make this system not a machine make it

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,520
an actual

00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,720
like living breathing community of

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,440
people

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,480
um because i tend to i tend to struggle

00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,240
with the um

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,240
empathy and interpersonal communication

00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,680
