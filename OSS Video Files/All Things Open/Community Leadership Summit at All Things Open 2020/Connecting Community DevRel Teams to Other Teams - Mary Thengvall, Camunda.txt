Presented at All Things Open 2020, Community Leadership Summit

Abstract: Community and Developer Relations teams have a unique blend of knowledge, and we can only be successful if we interface with other teams such as Marketing, Engineering, Support, and Customer Success well. How do we do this though? How do we build great relationships, solid alliances, share information effectively, and collaborate on projects? There is a lot to discuss here - let's explore this together!

well thanks everybody for joining today

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,559
um i'm going to go ahead and keep my

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,200
camera on if you want to turn your

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,000
cameras on

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,880
feel free to but we are here chatting

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,800
today about uh

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,560
developer relations and community teams

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,640
working internally

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,560
um with other teams throughout your

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,519
company and how that is

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,560
just as important or some might say more

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,160
important

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,640
than working with the external

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,320
communities um i know i've had a number

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
of conversations with people about this

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,000
over the years

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
and kind of the the struggle to make

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,320
sure that

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,719
they are um

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,559
internally advocating for their team uh

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,120
as well as their community members

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,280
and working to make sure that they're

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160
working across teams to accomplish those

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,600
those same goals um but then also

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,680
working to

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,840
make sure that they're communicating

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,840
their team goals

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,120
back internally into the company so the

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,799
company understands

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,159
as well as making sure that their team

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,119
goals

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,080
go all the way up to the overarching

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,360
company goals

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
so i think there's a couple different

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,479
directions we could take this

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,439
conversation in today um i'm

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,200
happy to go in whatever directions you

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,520
all want to and kind of

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
let let the conversation be driven by

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,040
the questions that we have

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,479
and the interesting topics to you all um

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,600
there is a link to the google doc that

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,720
we're going to be taking notes on

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,360
throughout the session

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,479
amber just dropped that in chat so feel

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,720
free to hop in there

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,920
and jot down notes as people are saying

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,320
interesting things

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,000
um i'll be keeping an eye on it and

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,560
trying to jot things down as well but i

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,680
will say

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,640
i am not good at talking and typing at

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,880
the same time

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,240
so i'll be typing while while other

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,840
people are talking and keeping up with

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,280
things there

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,960
um does anyone have

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,439
any pressing directions they want to

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,360
take the conversation in first

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,880
or or a particular angle that they want

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,000
to discuss

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,360
from the start hey mary this is matt

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,599
broberg here

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,560
hey there how's it going good good to

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,360
see you

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,800
uh i had one thought on my mind that i

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,800
just want to throw out there see if it

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,319
helps guide the direction

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,120
i'm really fascinated in the constraints

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,200
of different job roles these days and

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,760
what drives people towards one

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,879
type of role versus another so i'd be

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,800
interested in your angle

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,879
on how do you find like what the

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,879
constraint is to devrel

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,319
what are they ultimately responsible for

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,040
and working within

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,080
and if that's a one-size-fits-all or

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,000
something that

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,000
really truly depends on the organization

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,000
that's a great question um so you're

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,480
talking about constraints in

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,160
the idea of you know we're working

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
across teams and with other people on

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,680
other teams but

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,840
perhaps making sure that we're not

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,400
taking on too much work or work that

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,159
isn't

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,440
relevant to us specifically is that

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,560
correct nailed it

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,440
exactly perfect um

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,159
anyone i'm i'm happy to speak to that

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,000
but i also

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,280
don't want to be dominating things does

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,560
anyone else have

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,040
a comment or thought

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,040
on that

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,080
cool i can start things off um

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,720
so the question is how do we make sure

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,159
we're not taking on work that isn't

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,200
devrel right um

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,239
so i think the the biggest thing to me

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,280
around making sure that we're working on

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,360
on topics and tasks that are

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,959
super relevant for us is making sure

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,680
that we're working in partnership with

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,480
other teams

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,959
not doing work on behalf of other teams

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,680
um

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,680
and i think that's a there's a nuance

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,599
there that's important to keep in mind

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,480
um but the way that i really think about

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,280
that is it's less about

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
filling gaps that the other teams could

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,400
fill

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,040
and more about what are our unique

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
talents

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,600
and abilities that we bring to the table

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,000
that perhaps can't be

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
accomplished by another team um so

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,199
things like

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:32,240
um writing technical tutorials about

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,720
uh integrations or things like that that

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,680
we have time to really dig into and

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,919
explore

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,440
uh from a developer advocacy stamp

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,360
standpoint at least

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,199
um where you know it might not be a main

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,680
priority for the engineering team

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,199
but it's something that the support team

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,919
brings up as an issue

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,280
or maybe the sales team is talking to

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,720
people and saying hey you know this

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,680
integration could be really useful

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,800
for our prospects um and that's work

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,240
that we can take on

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,320
and work in conjunction with support

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,000
and with sales to make sure that we're

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
accomplishing that in the right way and

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
that we're

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,240
approaching it from the right angle but

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,440
it's it's work that we are uniquely able

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,440
to do

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,680
and so i think that's that's the first

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,039
framework that i take is

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:23,120
is it something that the devrel team

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,759
is uniquely able to handle that another

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,720
team

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,000
either just doesn't have the time for or

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,199
doesn't have the ability

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,960
to approach from both the advocating for

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,520
the community as well as advocating for

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,520
the company

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,800
viewpoint

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
thoughts

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,759
i i love that i love that

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,680
specification right of like you have to

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,600
be working in partnership or

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,280
in support of another organization as

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,199
opposed to taking on tasks for them

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,680
maybe could you give an example of what

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,319
that's like in practice because i feel

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,919
like in

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,319
practice that can get pretty tricky to

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,919
know whether you're doing work that

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,560
you know quote unquote just needs to get

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,520
done and your team has time to do it as

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,319
devrel

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,319
or if you're you're truly like

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,160
satisfying that partnership you're

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,960
you're mapping out yeah absolutely um so

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,880
we actually have

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,400
a a great example of this that we've

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,960
been um

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,600
kind of navigating at kamunda a little

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,120
bit

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,720
um we have a community marketing team

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,560
um that handles some of our like

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,919
external communications and things like

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,680
that so we have

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,120
uh we work with this person on a

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,639
day-to-day basis but

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,560
they're the ones handling the the

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,360
newsletter and things like that

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,800
um and this individual doesn't have a

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,759
technical background they aren't super

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,479
tech savvy

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,840
and so figuring out you know what

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,919
articles should i include

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,360
or how do i approach this conversation

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,960
in the right way or

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
what should i say about the latest

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,560
release isn't

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,039
necessarily their strong suit but

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,960
i want them to be able to own that

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,240
newsletter and for them to not just be

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,440
relying on

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,840
my team or the engineering teams to

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,240
really

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,039
um provide those answers for them

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,840
and so i encourage my team to say hey

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,440
you know

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,599
we'll we'll look it over for you after

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,360
it's done or we'll point you in the

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,120
right direction to find the information

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
that you're looking for

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,599
but we aren't necessarily going to write

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,639
this whole section of the newsletter for

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,240
you

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,840
on a regular basis because it's a

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,599
learning opportunity for their team

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,960
and so it turns us into more mentors

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,759
for our co-workers rather than doing the

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,360
work

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,879
for them um it's it's the idea of

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,120
teaching someone to fish rather than

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,879
fishing providing the fish

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,720
for them right the old adage there um

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,240
and so i think that's that's one example

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
where that's easily something we could

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,759
step in and do like oh well

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,759
you know it'll take me 20 minutes to

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,280
write up a paragraph about the latest

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,720
release and pull all of the relevant

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,160
blog posts and forum posts and

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,440
everything else and help you include

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
that in the next newsletter and we could

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,560
totally do

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,919
that on an ongoing basis but then that's

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,919
one more

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,759
20 minute segment that we're doing on a

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,520
monthly or weekly basis depending on how

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,319
often that newsletter is going out

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,000
rather than saying hey here's the right

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,560
places to look for that information

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,560
on an ongoing basis here's the right

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,200
tags in the forum to look for

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,519
um here's the right areas to go to in

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,000
the blog posts

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,599
set up a you know slack channel in our

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,959
company slack where people can kind of

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,399
drop links to things that might be

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,360
relevant to you

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,080
to include um and then we're happy to to

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,600
look it over

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,760
before it goes out to the community to

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,279
say uh actually let's mention this one

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,519
instead of this one or

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,040
here's the reasoning behind mentioning

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,399
this part of the release versus that

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,279
part of the release

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:08,240
and kind of guiding more than doing the

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:11,279
actual work

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
disagree or have have counterpoints or

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,680
perhaps other examples of ways that they

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,080
worked

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,560
across teams to kind of accomplish those

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,560
similar

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
objectives

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,760
okay i let the awkward silence hang for

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,480
enough time for it to actually be

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,839
awkward there um

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,160
well mary i'm always happy to talk to

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,600
you we um

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,200
jammed on this topic a lot um so

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,399
definitely so i guess there's got to be

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,519
like a

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,839
reciprocal interest right like they're

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,600
an interest in people learning what

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,519
you're offering to teach them

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
as opposed to just asking you to get a

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,920
task done

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,880
that's a different relationship than

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,079
some other

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,240
teams have right like sales just wants

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,160
marketing to send them leads

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,680
you know engineering just gets the

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,000
engineering done and asked marketing to

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,360
send

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,920
out the messaging so is devrel

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,720
special in that way or or is it just

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
like a different

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,959
negotiation i'm trying to think about

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,839
like how this really works and how

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,519
people

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,399
get it in their head that that's okay

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,320
that we're a support org not a

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,800
a service org where you just give us a

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,920
task and we get the task done

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,839
yeah 100 and i think there's

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,360
there are times when we are a service

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,440
org and there are times when we are

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,240
support org and figuring out

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,959
the distinction between those two takes

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
time

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,560
and energy and building relationships

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,079
internally um

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,440
so i think knowing the the difference

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,160
between the two

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,959
like there's gonna be some things that

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
we just

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,480
do on behalf of other teams right it

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,839
might be

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,720
uh i don't know pulling download metrics

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,880
or

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,720
keeping track of particular stats on a

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,680
month-to-month basis or things like that

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,120
and then there's going to be other

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,200
things that we can say

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,560
hey yeah i can totally help you with

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,399
that but while i'm helping you this time

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,600
why don't we set up a call instead so i

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,120
can walk you through what i'm actually

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,600
doing so that next time

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,200
you can do it yourself and there's there

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,839
are times when those conversations will

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,160
be met with

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,440
yeah sure no problem sounds great and

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,920
there are other times when someone will

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,240
go

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,959
no no i just want you to do it for me at

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,519
which point

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,120
it's it's a matter of you know either

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,440
having the difficult conversation

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,720
of like again happy to have this

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
conversation with you

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,639
this time or happy to do this on your

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,800
behalf this time

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,000
but let's let's figure out a partnership

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,600
going forward or

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,760
a way that i can really help you figure

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,880
out how to do this yourself

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,399
um so i think there's there's some

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,920
relationship building that comes in

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,959
handy there um

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,000
so that the internal

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,519
your co-workers your teammates the

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,200
stakeholders throughout the company

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,839
aren't seeing you as a

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,600
service sorry they are seeing you as a

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,920
service org not a support org

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,760
no they're seeing you the correct way

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,120
i'm gonna stop trying to to

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,240
differentiate there

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,920
um but they're seeing it as uh

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,839
they're seeing debra community as an

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,240
organization they can partner with

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
and really grow and learn with rather

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,120
than just

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,839
hey i need you to do this thing cool

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,839
that's done now

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,680
um jason i saw you left a question in

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,600
chat

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,040
do you want you want to go ahead and

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,560
walk me through that and we can

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,079
sure you know i was trying to figure out

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,760
a way to kind of

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,279
connect all the conversations i think

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,160
there's there's some

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,760
there's some really different

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,560
backgrounds like one of the the things

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,040
that that's

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,540
kind of different in in my history is

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,880
that um

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,720
[Music]

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,560
like i you know i was building

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
communities for a company that didn't

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,279
really have a developer relations team

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,040
because they didn't

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,040
you know yes there's customers and

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,480
there's customer support

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,920
um but like the software

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,360
and we're developing open source

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,040
software and working with open source

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,959
software communities but the software

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,880
wasn't the product

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,399
right the software just runs on the

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,440
product

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,720
um and so it was with there really

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,639
wasn't a

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,680
there's there's customer relations but

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,279
not really developer relations

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,199
um if you know what i mean and it and so

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,959
trying to get them to um

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,320
you know somewhat my role to escalate

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,199
things to them so that

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,279
you know we would get the you know the

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,800
the community supported

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,920
um but a lot of times you know um

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,800
me and my organization became more of a

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,360
um well you guys exist so we don't have

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,720
to worry about that

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,920
um as the as the community team so

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,440
um you know i'm really interested in and

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,399
what lessons you've learned about

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,440
getting um

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,600
you know communicating through the

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,440
company the value of engaging

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,360
with them with community and and

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,880
allowing them to kind of scope things in

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,320
the right level right because that that

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,000
was always

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,760
the confusion is how much should their

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,959
support team

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,600
spend being supporting the community

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,040
versus supporting you know people

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,040
identified as

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,560
buying customers yeah yeah absolutely

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,560
and i think that's a really really

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,560
important part and i think that

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,760
actually to a certain extent plays back

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
into what we were just talking about

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,480
with how do you work

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,560
across teams and help people understand

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,399
that you're you know this is work that

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,399
is valuable and work that we can do

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,519
but also then we have other work that's

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,440
valuable and so it's not just

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,360
doing the work and working across teams

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,480
but it's showing the value of the work

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,199
that you're doing

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,920
not just with hey here's our download

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,519
stats or

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,600
hey here's the number of developers we

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,120
have on our platform but here's the

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,600
impact that that those people have

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,399
here's the way that they're really

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,120
contributing

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,440
and and giving back and the the

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,440
opportunities that this has given us

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
as a result of us being included in

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,199
these conversations

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,199
um so i think i think there's a couple

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,199
things there i would say

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,240
when a when an organization doesn't have

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,040
a dev rail team

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,399
it's almost more important for the

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,880
individual who's trying to do

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,680
devel type things or community type

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,480
things

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,839
to be communicating across teams partly

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,639
because

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,240
when you've got product support and you

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,839
know technical sales

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,519
or um the the

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,839
engineering team that's really working

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,759
on the the software side of the product

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,440
or those components

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:04,160
i think making sure that you have

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,079
weekly or maybe bi-monthly meetings with

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
those individuals who are engaging with

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,279
that

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,959
that developer audience is going to be

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,320
incredibly important

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,600
because it's not a main focus of the

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,320
company

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,440
but it's a main focus for the success of

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,040
that component

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,800
and so if you can figure out you know

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,480
here's here's the reason why it's

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,839
necessary for us to keep this component

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,880
up and running

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,199
and then secondly here's the reason why

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,880
we need engagement in order to keep this

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,160
component up and running

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,079
and how that then feeds back into

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,759
the overarching product the overarching

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,120
success of the company

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,120
all of those types of answers

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,959
kind of come out of that and help you

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,959
really

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,079
be able to prove the value of the work

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,880
that you're doing

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,240
not only externally for the community

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,079
because the community can see it and

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,000
they go oh this is amazing this is

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,560
exactly what i was hoping for

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,920
but also internally so that you can say

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,160
look

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,280
because we have a footing in this

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,039
developer community

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,199
we're also able to reach these other

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,240
places which helps with the general

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,760
promotion of

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,919
the product even though the general

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,799
product isn't a developer product as a

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,720
whole

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,799
in the end it all seems like more work

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,679
than actually doing it right and

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,520
even convincing team members you know

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,959
within the support organization to

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,919
actually do the work that they need to

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,919
do to support

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,840
it's easier to go to the team members

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,640
they want to support the community

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,960
it's easy to talk them into it they do

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,559
it

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,480
but then at the end of the day they get

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,160
no credit for it

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,679
because you know the the it's too hard

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,799
to communicate the value

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,799
into their org structure

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
yeah and i think that's where well two

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,080
things one

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,799
the relationship building right that it

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,520
has to be

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,000
internal as well as external and the

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,600
second

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,039
and i've said this a handful of times

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
before in

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,120
other conversations but a huge part of

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,320
developer relations

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,880
is internal public relations so

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,480
think of it as the like you know maybe

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
not sending an official press release

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,840
but like

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,760
how do you amplify the work that your

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,760
co-workers are doing how do you amplify

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,400
the work that your community is doing

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,320
how do you amplify the importance and

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
the value that you're seeing

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,880
internally as well as externally to make

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,360
sure that other people are understanding

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,480
the value of the devrel team but are

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,600
also interested in

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,120
engaging with you and so a big part of

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,440
our role and i think for me

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,880
now that i'm managing a devrel team a

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,400
huge part of my role

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,000
is making sure that other teams

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,840
throughout the company see

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,760
the interesting things that we're doing

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,720
and see the in the value that

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,240
those interesting things give back to

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,240
the broader company

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,919
because that then intrigues them and

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,559
makes them want to be involved so that

00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,000
the next time my team goes to

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,000
the support department support goes oh

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,760
yeah hey and this this project you

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,440
worked on last week was really cool and

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,280
i read about that here and you know

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,280
thanks for providing that summary

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,880
of course we'll be involved because it

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,480
it

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,960
gives that authenticity and and trust

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,320
to the projects that you're working on

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,840
so that you aren't having to convince

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,360
other people to be involved

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,000
that they're aware of what you're doing

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,360
and want to be involved from the start

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,120
you're you're encouraging me to

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,440
communicate a lot more of the what i

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,919
would

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
consider very mundane right because

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,880
because sometimes just to keep the

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
community going

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,919
just having somebody in the support team

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,160
say hi to them

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,120
and acknowledge them is enough to

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,200
encourage them to keep moving forward

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,120
um you know knowing that they're not

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,720
you're working in a vacuum

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,000
um and then to to say thank you just for

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,080
saying hi

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,320
you know really 100 could go a long way

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,640
absolutely i love that idea of

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,559
communicating what we feel is mundane

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,320
right because we don't necessarily think

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,960
it's important to say hey

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,559
i finished this task or hey you know i

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,360
met this community member

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,440
but being able to highlight that for

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,640
other people who aren't as familiar with

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,679
developer relations and aren't as

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
familiar with what

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,960
we're doing i think is extremely

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,200
important um

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:24,400
we actually have a devrel task board for

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,760
my team as a whole um and last week i

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,640
introduced a

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,280
trello integration with slack that

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,559
basically every time we move a card into

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,320
the done column

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,280
it shoots a message over to um

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,720
our like ask devrel slack channel that's

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,880
public for the company

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,159
that says hey you know so and so finish

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,559
this task

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,320
um here's you know click here for more

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,360
information and takes them back to the

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,679
task board

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,559
but then that lets the team then you

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,919
know in thread

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,159
say hey thanks to you know this person

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,080
from support and this person from

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,000
engineering and this person from

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,440
marketing for really helping out

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,120
with this project and driving this

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,919
forward and so it lets

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,600
us kind of give kudos but also makes

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,440
other teams aware of what we're doing

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,280
and since i mean i think that was

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
thursday that i introduced that so it's

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,200
been like

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,520
two business days and we've already had

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,960
more engagement in that channel than

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,159
we've had in a while because we have

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,840
people going oh

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,000
oh you finished that thing i didn't

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,960
realize so it makes it easier to

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,120
communicate

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,559
across the company what we're doing and

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,559
to engage other teams

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,919
matt said a couple things in in chat

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,919
there um

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,640
do you want to highlight those to you

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,039
matt or you want me to

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,919
to read them out loud for you oh sure

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,679
i'll jump in

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,200
yeah i was just thinking as you were

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,400
talking jason it

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,799
sounds like uh yeah like there's a

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,679
internal business case that maybe needs

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,799
to be formalized in a way

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,640
and value of community is

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,760
absolutely fascinating to me and just a

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,679
horrible bottomless well of challenge

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,840
because it's so fun to do the work but

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,720
to explain it to an organization seems

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,360
to be

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,640
an endless task at times but i found

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,039
like focusing on

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
an executive sponsor because ultimately

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,880
organizations work

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,039
through budgeting and budgeting is a

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,640
function of somebody who has a budget

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,480
so figuring out whatever narrative you

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,960
need to tell them and then

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,080
you know putting the pieces together we

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,400
do a lot of work like that

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,440
in the chaos community which is an open

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,480
source oregon a part of

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,520
and yeah if if you want to jump into

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,600
that and talk more

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,960
i'm always happy to um and then the last

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,919
thing that came to mind is that

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,600
you know maybe uh you know maybe you are

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,200
the ideal community manager and you

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,280
don't want to take on the task on top of

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,799
that of a program management role

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,039
where like you're putting together the

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,880
business case that that is legit

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,120
and different skills and different

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,159
challenges so finding somebody who maybe

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,320
wants to take on that

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,280
internal comms to complement your

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,400
external comms

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,400
can be really effective

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,320
100 with that and i think that's an

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,880
important place for

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,919
the manager to come into play too like

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,880
if

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,440
if you are a team of one who's reporting

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
up to

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,320
the cmo or the cto or the vp of product

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,960
or something else like it's extremely

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,159
difficult

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,840
to do the work communicate the work come

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,200
up with the business case

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,880
make sure that's being communicated

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,440
internally as well as externally like

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,880
that's that's a lot of jobs all in one

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,640
so i think if you're lucky enough to

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,679
actually have a

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,320
head of devrel director of devrel devel

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,720
manager

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,480
something along those lines working

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,120
heavily in partnership with that manager

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,679
and your team

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,360
to say hey i think this is the business

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,799
case for doing this i think this is my

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,799
reasoning for doing this

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,480
can you help me kind of firm this up and

00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,600
present it in a way that other people

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,720
throughout the company are going to

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,240
understand

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,520
is a really really valuable um

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,520
asset and an ally to have um

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,520
if you don't have that i would encourage

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,120
you to find people throughout the

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,799
industry who are

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,000
figuring out how to do that as well and

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,440
maybe you've got a group that you can

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
meet with

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,120
every couple weeks to just say cool

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,840
here's the projects that i'm working on

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,039
how do i prove that that internal

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,080
business value

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,720
to other people and i think i mean i

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,120
could talk about

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
business valuable relations all day um i

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,520
have a book about it

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,480
i can literally talk about it all day um

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,880
but i think that's

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,840
that's a a really important piece that

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,039
we forget

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,480
so often um is that you know if you

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,480
don't know the business value for what

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,520
you're doing

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,200
why are we doing it like how do you

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,720
how do you prioritize things how do you

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,480
figure out what to do next

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,840
how do you justify the work that you're

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,360
doing um

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,360
when someone else comes down and says

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,799
hey show me some metrics show me the

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,480
value of what you're working on

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,000
and so i think that partly goes back to

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,320
the executive sponsorship that

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,600
matt you were just talking about um with

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,039
making sure that you've got someone who

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,279
really believes in

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,480
what you're doing and understands the

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,919
value of what you're doing and

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,520
partnering with them to make sure that

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,400
you can paint that picture

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,400
internally as well

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,960
mike you said something about plus one

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,400
for communication i'd love to hear

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,360
some examples of um how that has

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,799
benefited you

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,400
and you're working with your sales

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,240
department specifically

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,919
yeah i mean like so one of the big

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,520
things that has

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,760
you know really helped with us is um

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,279
kind of just having a random channel

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,840
where we just like

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,960
post the random updates from devrel team

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,880
myself and

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,559
you know another colleague of mine and

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,760
we just post like hey

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,320
sales folks we um we built this demo

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,360
or we have this new version of a product

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,000
we're releasing

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,799
just to keep them you know interested

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,279
and if it

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,880
hits any major pain points that they

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,440
constantly hear

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,960
you know having that conversation uh

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,200
just like out in this channel and then

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,520
they're like oh well

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,360
what else is there um what else can we

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,919
talk about or what else are you working

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,039
on

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,400
uh we have whatever number of calls

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,600
where this is a problem that they're

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,760
trying to face

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,000
and having just just posting those

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,440
random updates just kind of

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,440
you know out just putting it out there

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,080
into the user um

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,120
and then just be making a regular thing

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,840
has just

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,520
really helped grow the communication and

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,440
feedback cycle between

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,600
sales trying to figure out what do we

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,720
actually need to know and what can we do

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,240
to help

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,279
our clients and then having

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,720
us as deborah find out okay what are

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,279
some things that we should be working on

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,840
or what are some common problems

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,400
as it can be pretty easy to like get

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,760
lost

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,200
in what do the average users uh

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,360
what are the problems that average users

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,840
face and um

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,200
no are we are we too far removed from

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,440
that

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,679
i love that i love that and i love that

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,880
it's opening up further discussions i

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,559
love that other people are asking

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,960
questions about it and then it's

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:22,559
stopped being just a let me talk to you

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,600
and turned into a let me talk with you

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:30,640
and encourage you to to

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,640
participate in what we're doing yeah

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,720
awesome

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,240
um other thoughts questions areas people

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,200
want to take the discussion

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,279
hey mary i just want you to join me oh

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,360
it's going all right how you doing

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,039
doing all right i just wanted to

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,080
verbalize a note that i put

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,159
into the google doc which is

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,200
you know gitlab one thing we're trying

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,520
um

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,360
you know going forward is to have

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,159
essentially budgets for

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,679
our internal stakeholders so um other

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,120
teams in marketing and also you know

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,559
kind of other teams outside of marketing

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,320
will each have a budget and we have a

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,039
scoring system that we created

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,880
and the hope is that uh by implementing

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,120
these limits we'll kind of

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,000
force these stakeholders to prioritize

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,520
their requests

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,200
for our team um rather than our team

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,159
doing the prioritization when we're

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,399
often one step

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,840
removed so you can imagine if you're you

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,000
know a field marketer

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,880
and you know that you only have you know

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,919
say 20

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
kind of budget points for a quarter

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,279
rather than kind of sending everything

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,960
to devrel and letting us do the

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,520
prioritization we're hoping that they'll

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,200
do

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,440
the prioritization and making sure that

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,840
they only send us say the top

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,640
you know seven or eight s for the

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,880
quarter

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,520
i love that idea i think it's a really

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,600
cool way to kind of say

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,279
here's here's how we're prioritizing

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,440
things and why

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,799
so that other people understand you know

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,120
here's the priorities of

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,720
the devrel team of the community team

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,080
and and

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,039
what we can request from them and how to

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,440
how to actually handle that i'd love to

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,960
hear

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,039
do you have um

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
ways for like official ways for people

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,880
to make those requests

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,240
or is it all kind of one-off

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,440
conversations that happen throughout the

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,760
quarter

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,440
yeah so um i think you're familiar with

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,039
this because of the work that you did

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,360
with get lab commit but

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,880
um i get like we use issues for kind of

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,640
tracking everything and so we have issue

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,000
templates for requests that have

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,279
you know labels um and then there's also

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
kind of like a weighting

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,880
to those issues so depending on you know

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,679
whether the request is for say brand new

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,360
you know content um that we don't you

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,000
know haven't yet prepared

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,960
will be kind of a higher score against

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,480
your budget than

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,279
asking someone to come and do like a

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,960
one-hour q a with the team where there's

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,880
no material that needs to be paired or

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,039
delivering a talk that they've already

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
delivered in other kind of venues or

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,640
forums

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,880
so that's the the process that we have

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,640
you know these issue requests and then

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,720
a score based on the type of content

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,200
that folks are requesting and then

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,039
that'll be kind of you know deducted

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,679
from their quarterly budget as their

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,399
requests come in

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,720
awesome i love that i love that so it's

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,000
a new kind of thing

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,799
you know as everything that we do at

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,600
gitlab is completely open so i can even

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,200
i'll link to the merge request um that's

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,720
going to add this to our handbook in the

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,480
docs and i would love for folks on this

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,320
call to take a look at it and

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,520
leave uh feedback if they have any

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,440
thoughts on how we can improve that

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,640
process

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,640
fantastic thanks john

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,760
anyone else have questions or comments

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:51,840
or directions you'd like

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,840
the conversation to go in next

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:04,159
cool i know for me i'd love to hear

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:08,720
a little bit about um

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:11,039
how how teams are communicating

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,640
not just what they're working on but the

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,279
um

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,320
you know uh feedback they're hearing

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,519
from the community

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,960
or um kind of how they're how they're

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,080
communicating with other teams as a

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,360
whole are you using

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,080
slack or using um collaborative docs

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,640
are you using things like gitlab or

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,480
github

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,480
to to share those issues um

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,600
is there any sort of official feedback

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,919
loop how

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,880
how in general are you kind of having

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,840
these conversations

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:47,840
in a way that to make in a way that

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,840
makes sure that they're documented

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,720
i started to type out my response but it

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,159
may be just replying

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,720
um might be better because you know i

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,440
think we all have to deal with these

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,480
um these the ways of collaborating i

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,080
know we use um

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,760
we do use slack heavily and i'm

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,799
personally really embarrassed about it

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,399
because

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,440
um it's not open source um

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,159
and um you know we our our official

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,279
channels

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,399
are through email and irc

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,880
um but somewhat de facto we've ended up

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,080
using

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:35,440
slack to kind of

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,440
create a somewhat unintended two-tier

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,679
environment where kind of our lead

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,440
community developers

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,960
show up in the in the slack and there's

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,880
less noise

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,279
and the noobs show up in irc um

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,559
and you know and we we have critical

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,960
mass in the irc

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,440
but um it's not where a lot of the real

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,039
development this discussion gets done

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,360
um and i'm i'm i i hate it

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,480
i just i don't like having that

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,880
hierarchical

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,880
sort of thing and using non-open tools

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,080
that's an interesting interesting point

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,559
that it makes me think of is that

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,720
if there's no documentation or

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,640
communication between those two tools

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,320
then there's no way to kind of close

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,519
that loop and make sure that people are

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,919
aware

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,880
of what's going on yeah because it's

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,960
only because yeah you'll have

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,840
communication totally separate from each

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,919
one

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,440
um and then the only the only meet in

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,559
the the get repos

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,919
and the get issues list right so um

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,000
and somebody will be kind of left out of

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,120
the discussion when they see something

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,519
and like hey well you know glad this

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,120
happened but where'd this come from

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:49,279
right exactly exactly and i think

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,720
uh going a bit broader for a second i

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,000
think there's a lot of companies that

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,360
are experiencing this for the first

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,120
time right not just with their

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,480
communities but like

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,640
people who are used to having these

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,240
conversations went off in the office as

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,760
they pass each other

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,120
and they're now suddenly going wait i

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,679
don't pass you in the office every day

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,320
how do i actually get that information

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,839
how do i go beyond just hey we're

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,960
hopping on a quick zoom call for five

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,079
minutes but make sure that's

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,440
communicated to

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,440
the rest of the team as well

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,560
anyone else you feel free to unmute

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,359
yourself and just and just speak up

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,280
um gordon you just said there's a lot of

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,839
fragmentation and chat tools i

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,879
completely agree uh do you have a way

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,240
that you're kind of

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:37,520
circumventing that or not

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:41,040
not really um i mean the problem is

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,119
is you sort of say you know

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,599
jason was just saying you know you know

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,919
irc's open source all that

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,520
you know we might prefer to use that but

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,839
if you tell

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,440
you know if you tell serve your brand

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,240
your random people

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,440
uh you know oh no you have to use irc

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,480
that's the only

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,119
you know tool we use to chat with

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,920
they're going to be so like yep sayonara

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,599
see you

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,359
um yeah so i i don't i mean i don't have

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,800
a good answer i mean there must be at

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,000
least three different

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,839
uh chat tools that are widely used at

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,240
red hat

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,079
so yeah then there's getter

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,599
and then there's discord and then

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,040
there's you know and

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,040
and all of them have relevant

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,359
discussions right you know

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,280
yeah yeah i mean i'm probably not even

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,359
aware of some of the

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,960
uh you know of some of the tools used at

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,920
red hat because i'm not

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,240
in the specific communities that you

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,240
know that use them

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,000
yeah i mean this is a this is a 20th

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,880
century nightmare

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,040
that like you know has only been

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,920
aggravated in the last 20 years

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,000
it's it's um yeah well at least with im

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,079
for a while we had something like

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
uh what was it trillium or something

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,640
like that that kind of tied them

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,720
together

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,720
but now you've got slack you've got

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,000
google chat you've got irc

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,200
you get discourse and people use

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,880
what they're familiar with and

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,240
it's just a mess

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,000
and we're only talking synchronous

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,760
communication which uh

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,079
naturally bounds people by their

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,280
geography and ends up bifurcating your

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,280
communities

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,599
so i mean when we break into

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,800
asynchronous and wikis

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,640
or discourse as an alternative it it

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,280
just gets absolutely massive

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,720
um it's a really fun topic to try to map

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,359
but i felt like

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,160
it's impossible to get everybody to one

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,000
place

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,320
but by advertising a default choice

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,839
you can often drive people there if

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,800
people aren't being driven to that

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,240
default choice

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,000
you've made a choice that is

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,240
inconvenient for a majority of your

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,119
community and you have to reconsider

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,160
your

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,480
your decision making around that

00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,839
i really prefer to default to open

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,520
source as well

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,680
thank goodness element dot io

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,960
formallyrio.im

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,760
is becoming a really great client

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,720
server client config for irc users as

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,880
well as

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,839
you know those that are on ma the matrix

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,480
system

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,560
um but even with that said like you're

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,240
gonna have people on slack and

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,760
that's okay in my book um

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,440
yeah anyway i'll stop there but there

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,400
there's a lot of mapping

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,680
work to do there and um it's it's a

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,599
pretty big topic i'd love to dig into it

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,960
yeah i think there could be a whole

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,720
whole session about that

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,640
itself um i'd love to circle back though

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,560
there's an interesting point matt you

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,760
just said it'll bifurcate your community

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,839
sometimes

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,200
um gordon you mentioned the

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,560
fragmentation of chat

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,320
chat tools causes a lack of

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,359
communication as a whole

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,359
um and then um

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,160
john or jason or somebody mentioned at

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,200
the beginning

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,880
um that you know there's there's pros

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,240
and cons of having things in different

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,800
places

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,800
but it sounds like we don't really have

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,320
a singular place we can point people

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,680
back to to say here's

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,800
here's what's going on here's what we're

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,880
doing and maybe that's where

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,400
you know we're back to the maybe you

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,079
have a program manager on your team

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,800
who's responsible for

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,680
communicating that you know succinctly

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,720
back to

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,839
the company um and having a way to

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,520
have a singular place that people can

00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,520
see here's the

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,880
curated feedback from the community or

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,800
here's the

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,640
um the the cliff notes version

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,720
and here's where you can go to learn

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,440
more about that because i think that's

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,520
an important part of our role as

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,680
community managers isn't just

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,720
you know sending the flood of feedback

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,000
back to the

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,400
the product engineering teams but it's

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,040
it's making sure that we've curated that

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,480
feedback

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:06,400
in a way that that is

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,480
um consumable by our coworkers

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,480
so they not only understand here's the

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,480
direct feedback but here's

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,720
the reason why this feedback at this

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,720
point in time is particularly important

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,839
thoughts questions ways that people

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,839
solve that for their teams

00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,640
i mean i love the point that

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,760
communication

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,560
ends up growing organically and we we

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,040
make

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,880
kind of default choices by accident

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,119
based on whatever's in trend

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,079
slack being the biggest trend these days

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,440
uh and then

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,839
you know you get kind of stuck there

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,280
there's like a gravity to it for sure

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,400
um but that said like yeah you can with

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,640
intention

00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,760
change that narrative and draw people

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,680
someplace

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,880
the single greatest strategy i've had

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,680
there is that

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,160
you can draw people to new places really

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,480
if and

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,319
only if you're reducing the other

00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,640
channels they have to check

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,160
like adding an n plus one is a nightmare

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,720
to people it's just another

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,240
thing to check but if you're saying we

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,880
will officially stop using

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,599
the three mailing lists we're using in

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,839
this discord server and this irc channel

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,480
if you all come to discourse

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,040
uh you can end up drawing people to one

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,359
place

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,599
and start to normalize that but i i

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,640
think it's it's often underestimated how

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,839
challenging is

00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,560
to get people to communicate uh

00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,880
so um i i guess the short version is

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,359
don't trivialize that and make sure you

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,680
research and put it together as a as a

00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,880
proposal for people

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,359
absolutely and maybe maybe that's a

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,480
point of value that we provide to

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:59,440
our internal colleagues right is cool

00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,920
as a community manager as a dev advocate

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,240
as

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,680
a general professional we are

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,960
responsible for hurting all of those

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,560
cats and making sure that

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,240
you know all of the different places are

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,359
taken care of but

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,200
something that we do as a team is on a

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,359
weekly basis we'll curate all of the

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,839
feedback that we're getting

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,520
come up with a you know miniature report

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,720
of here's the feedback that was reported

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,280
this week

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,400
here's the the customers or community

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,160
members or

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,160
people who are encountering these issues

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,040
and the reasons why it's super important

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,880
and we maybe then prioritize that that

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,200
feedback in a way that's consumable

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,560
by the other departments and so maybe

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,880
that's

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,800
an avenue of communication where we can

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,400
truly show here's here's the value that

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,839
we provide you we're keeping you from

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,079
having to go to the three different

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,480
mailing lists and the slack and the irc

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,119
and element and all of these different

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,319
places

00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,319
because you don't have time to aggregate

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,319
that but that's something that that our

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,839
team can do

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,440
on your behalf and that

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,040
i think takes us back also to the

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,319
original conversation about you know how

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,680
do we make sure that we're focused on

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,079
work that is

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,800
meaningful and important for the devrel

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,560
team

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,880
i think that might be one of the most

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,640
meaningful things even though it feels

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,560
far more um

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,760
tedious than some of the other work that

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,400
we do perhaps

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,480
but we have the unique ability to say

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,000
this is incredibly valuable or this is a

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,760
pattern that i'm seeing or this is

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,440
something that keeps coming up

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,920
that we really need to address because

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,599
now it's not you know one person saying

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,960
it it's five people saying it and four

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,480
out of five of those are

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,119
not only open source users but also

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,040
enterprise customers and

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,480
you know making that making that case

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,520
for it because we're keeping track of

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,839
all of those moving place

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,839
pieces on a regular basis

00:42:49,680 --> 00:43:00,640
any closing thoughts from folks

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,280
well mary where do you recommend we

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,240
continue the conversation

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,359
sure thanks for the the nice segue there

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,040
matt that wasn't even planned

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,040
um so there's been a few other folks

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,400
that are posting comments in the

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,000
google doc which i love um feel free to

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,880
follow up there with more information

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,079
too

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:26,720
um we can also connect

00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:29,200
asynchronously online um

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,960
if you're doing this type of work

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,880
professionally on a day-to-day basis

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,079
um i'm a little bit biased but we have

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,200
the the devrel collective on slack that

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,760
has been around for five six years now

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,520
um and a lot of these conversations take

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,119
place there on a regular basis as well

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,119
so feel free to

00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,560

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,760
you're not already there and we'll we'll

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,040
get you added in there for more

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,280
conversations

um i'm gonna go ahead and drop some

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,760

00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,520
circle back to those at the closing

community health so i hope that you'll
