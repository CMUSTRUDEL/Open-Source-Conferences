Abstract: In this discussion we will explore how to identify, foster, and support the success of new community leaders. Not everyone in a community will be a naturally leader, and often great leadership can come from unexpected places.

panelists we have there's the

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,960
conversation kind of

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,840

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,079
question nithia

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,559
yes so my question to amy was how did

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,480
she

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,920
become a community manager how did she

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,239
you know grow into her own she's a

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,760
fabulous community manager for the open

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,160
infrastructure summit

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,840
the openstack summit and she says that

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,280
she had to kick a chicken out of the

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,160
house and that's why she couldn't

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,359
respond

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,359
what a great excuse

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,500
that's a thing

00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,500
[Laughter]

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,840
yes gordon please join us

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,880
yup i'm here yay

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,640
gordon is that a background or is that

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,119
real

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,159
uh that's a background i'm going to say

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,280
you've got a lot of fun i have a lot of

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,600
books in my office but not that many

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
wow

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,479
i think just says when i think of

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,560
community managers i think of leaders

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,079
who set the community culture

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,240
and help direct the project absolutely

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,360
um some of the best community manager

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,920
i've seen and

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,880
i'm going to ask you gordon also for

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,399
your example

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,280
because you've written a fantastic book

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,840
about how open source gets done

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,479
to me there are two aspects to open

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,680
source right

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,759
one is the license but the second is how

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,640
the community comes together to get

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,200
work done and some of the best community

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,080
managers are people who

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,280
make sure that users and contributors

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
and maintainers

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,480
all have a role to play and work well

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
together

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,720
yeah i mean i think one of the things

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,080
that strike it kind of strikes me with

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,520
the good community

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,319
managers i know is i mean it varies

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,480
because it's

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,599
you know communities are very different

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,120
but i mean they are

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,120
people persons um you know they're

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,400
they're really good reaching out really

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,599
good with

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,360
making people feel you know they belong

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,680
uh that they're that people are

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,879
participating even if

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,920
it's not necessarily natural for them to

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,760
uh to even if they either feel like they

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,680
should be hanging back so

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,519
i think that's the first thing i think

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,360
of as a community manager

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,720
and quite frankly i think it's one

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
reason i

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,760
i think i would have trouble with the

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,120
role personally

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,319
because i don't necessarily do that

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,319
kind of thing naturally

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,080
can it be taught do you think uh

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,040
community management can be taught

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
or do they have to innately be people

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,040
oriented

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,159
and people managers i i think

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,440
many things can be taught uh

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,000
but it will prob probably comes more

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,519
naturally to some people than with

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,879
others i mean i think if somebody

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,640
like myself brings next thing i will do

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,560
is be a community manager

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,480
i would have to go in knowing i'm really

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,599
going to have to work at

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,400
overcoming my kind of natural tendencies

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,000
to kind of

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,360
go off in a room and do my own thing

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
i get the impression that it can be

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,400
taught but my kind of feeling is that um

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
i think people can learn the principles

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
and the approaches

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,200
um but i think that the motivation of

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
what

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,760
you know when you wake up in the morning

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,200
and you're just really excited about

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,560
doing your thing

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,480
um i think the kind of people who are

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,159
just motivated by

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,080
by working with people and building

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,920
human systems um

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,639
and enjoying that that meaty challenge

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,040
of

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,479
the mixture of workflow and people and

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,759
emotion

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,080
i don't think there's everybody's

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,840
attracted to that so therefore

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,000
i think anyone can learn it but staying

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,960
excited about it strikes me that people

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
just have different

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,400
intrinsic motivations yes yeah i mean

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,080
it's it's um

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,320
i mean it's different obviously but it's

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,320
like with you like doing sales for

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,800
example if uh

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,759
you know yeah i mean most engineers can

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,280
probably be taught

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,240
to be at least you know decent

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,880
sales people but a lot of them are not

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,240
going to

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,240
really want that role

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,759
i mean sorry go ahead go ahead please

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,800
oh thanks cynthia yeah i mean i actually

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,479
like the term facilitator um instead of

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,039
because i get comfortable when somebody

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,600
calls me

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,919
like a leader in the community that's i

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,639
mean it's very nice and i'm flattered

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,080
but

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,280
i think i my i view my my role more of

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,280
as a facilitator

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,720
and enable people to do their work like

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,360
whatever they're best at

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,720
and uh this is sort of more i mean this

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
is one of your original questions an

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,199
idea like

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,639
what are some of the effective trainings

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,039
that people can do

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,840
um i got started by just facilitating

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,759
meetings

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,759
um i mean i didn't have the technical

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,039
expertise in that networking arena that

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,680
i was involved in but

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,039
you know i like it it doesn't have to be

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,960
a huge steering committee meeting it

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,880
could be a simple work group but

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
just being familiar with what people are

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,680
concerned about what resources they need

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
and then

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,360
you know my job i thought was to

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
advocate for those people

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,880
whether it's going to the management or

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,240
going to the board even right so

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,600
uh it's kind of you know drinking water

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,840
through the fire hose but

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
being active in involving working group

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,120
meetings or various meetings for the on

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,120
behalf of the community i think

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,840
could be a good way to sort of get up to

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,360
speed on things

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,160
that's such a great great um

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,720
point that you make raymond because most

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,840
of us

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,680
got started in a small way and then

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,440
you know we started building up all of

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,800
the skill sets needed right to be a

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,400
community manager

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
the other thing i often hear from

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,400
community managers is

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,600
each project is different what it needs

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,600
is different

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,440
and the skill sets you bring to the

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,759
table are different so

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,120
there is no one cookie cutter community

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,919
manager role

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
but the things you mentioned advocating

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,160
for

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,960
developers and people you know

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,000
facilitating people to feel included

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,160
and to contribute to the project and

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,680
building relationships with the project

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,479
such such that they

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,440
want to stay in the project are all such

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,440
key elements right

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,639
i think that i was going to say i think

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,680
a lot about uh

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,960
like it's the day-to-day activity of

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,759
building consensus

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,720
so that um so you have this like large

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,639
goal at the top

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,080
of your project and then someone's like

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
i'm kind of struggling with this little

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,919
piece on the bottom and

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,199
and they maybe don't understand how

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,360
their piece fits in

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,599
or they have been asked to do it in a

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
way that kind of runs counter to the end

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,759
goal

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,080
um just because someone didn't

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,280
understand the nuts and bolts of their

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,599
work and so

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,199
so it's like the a good community

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,680
manager sort of builds consensus and

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,680
it's like

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,280
oh hey we should ask them to do this top

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,720
to bottom instead of bottom of the top

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,560
because it'll produce a better result

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,240
for the overall project and

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,599
they'll be more motivated and help them

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,360
understand that the

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,879
piece that this role plays in the larger

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,759
hole

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,759
very very good point

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,560
what resources have you all kind of

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,759
used to become a community manager for

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,960
example for me

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,000
it was reading books it was on-the-job

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,879
training

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
um just like uh you know you said

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,160
raymond

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,240
it was running meetings and then taking

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,319
on something else and then taking on

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
something else but

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,479
what other resources are there for

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,360
community managers to become

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,960
you know better community managers i'd

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,879
like to add something to the

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,639
to that conversation just kind of the

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,080
natural intrinsic piece i think you

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,120
really need to have the energy and the

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,960
motivation

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,160
it is exhausting when you work with

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,919
large groups

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
you're dealing with lots and lots and

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,959
lots of different people lots of

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,320
different personalities and you have to

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,399
really kind of

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,839
put up that like kind of a border

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,760
because you can get really really

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,800
exhausted relatively pretty quickly

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,000
especially if you lead

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,600
large large forums so i definitely

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,839
think it's really important to just like

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,040
have the energy naturally to do it i

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,720
think is um

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,080
that's just one of those things that's

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,320
just kind of

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,920
you know you can build that over time so

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,519
that's just my little point i wanted to

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,080
jump in and add

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,920
you know brittany just kind of

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,600
underlining what you just said

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,200
um i i do think that

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,800
i get the impression that when people

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,320
really find their calling what they're

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
really excited about it's because

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,560
they're just

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,240
infinitely curious about what it is and

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,399
it doesn't necessarily mean that

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,320
they have to be great at it but they're

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,160
just really interested in learning

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,600
the details and how it all fits together

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,800
and how it glues together

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,240
um and i think some industries are well

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,080
supported with that so for example if

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,680
you want to be a founder of a company or

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,200
you want to be an entrepreneur

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,720
there's hundreds and hundreds of

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,399
business books out there to help you

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,080
through that journey

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
and um there's less of that for

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,320
community managers and

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,399
uh and i think nithya mentioned this

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,680
earlier on that

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,800
the scope the role in the scope of

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
community management varies so

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
significantly with different industries

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
i mean just for me

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,640
when i'm working with my clients you

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
know the way in which people build open

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,760
source communities is

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,200
totally different to the way in which

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,240
people build gaming communities for

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,279
example

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
and i think that's one of the reasons

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,800
why and i don't mean this as in a

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,920
braggadocious way i think events like

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,200
cls are important

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,720
so and you know and cmx and you know

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,519
devrel khan and all these events are so

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,800
important because i think it's an

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,360
opportunity for people to be curious

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,360
with their friends

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,920
so so go ahead please

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,320
yeah please go ahead so i was just

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,040
wanted to add certain points to it

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,600
that uh i clearly uh completely agree

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,079
with

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,000
with him that it is moreover that

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,120
somebody should have the inspiration and

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,519
motivation to do

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
any role that is one of the point which

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,320
is really very important

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,040
simultaneously any skills or

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,920
the capabilities can be built with the

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,959
time because

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,000
roles and responsibilities that evolve

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,720
with time

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,320
so you gradually you always have to keep

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,399
updating your skills

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,160
and capabilities with the time so that

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,360
can be built on the

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,640
job as the time evolves

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,800
however there is that basic nature which

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
which is motivation which is really

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,240
needed whenever you get into any new

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,240
role

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,360
anjali you summarized it really really

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,760
well i think

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,959
what i heard from a lot of people is

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,720
there needs to be

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,839
that energy and motivation and emotional

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,680
you know desire to do a community

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,399
leadership role because

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,000
it does take a lot of you know

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,240
motivation to do it

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,680
and then we talked about a couple of

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,720
resources to

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,920
uh grow your skill sets one was you know

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,000
just on the job

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,640
like ray was saying taking on small

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,959
things small groups of facilitation

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,680
and you know keep building those skills

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,200
the second

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,959
i have to um say plus one to what jono

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,000
said i think the community leadership

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,360
summit has been

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,200
a fantastic opportunity to share best

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,000
practices across teams

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,680
and across people and say hey how are

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
you handling this how are you handling

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,839
this

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,000
we do the same with the open source

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,639
program offices as well

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,680
and that's been a great way for me to

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,079
have learned

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
uh you know what somebody else is doing

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,600
and how to grow

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,680
you know on my own skill sets from a

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,320
community management perspective

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,440
um do you think there's a there's a role

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,880
for mentorship

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,440
in uh community leadership you think we

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,920
should

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,519
do a more formal mentorship program

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,720
where we match up

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,519
people who are rising stars in the

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,680
community

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,920
world and senior uh community leaders

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,920
yes

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,959
that would be really good and i would i

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,040
would

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,720
uh i don't know that how much important

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,519
it is but

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,120
since i'm from india so uh i have not

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,639
been part of open source

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,720
since long so i just got introduced with

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,200
certain people who helped me out in the

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,639
open source community so a lot of people

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,519
they don't know about the open source

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,680
community that

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,200
how you need to work with it and how you

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,240
can get involved in the different

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,880
projects so

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,320
it is something that you can also

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,320
improve the reach so that

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,079
a lot of people where they they don't

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,440
have this reach so they can also get

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,959
involved into it

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
and they can pick up certain good

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,000
projects just to enhance their skills

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,360
so that is one of the good thing thank

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
you

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,560
hi this is right uh my name is ray

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,440
eisenberg i

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,800
work with the world bank and i certainly

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,399
i certainly agree

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,880
about motivation however we have

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,600
over 400 communities of practice at the

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,720
world bank

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,120
worldwide dealing with multiple

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,279
themes whether it's women's education

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,839
health poverty

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,720
transparency in government

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,440
demilitarization kind of name

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,959
any social theme and the world bank's

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,000
there to the tune of

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,040
over 70 billion dollars a year

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,800
so we about eight to nine years ago kind

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,000
of before i joined there were lots of

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,240
communities that practiced being started

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,480
but lots were failing and

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
notwithstanding the motivation and the

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,240
good will

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,399
and good will driven by incredible

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,800
motivation around these causes

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,399
everybody at the world bank totally

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,000
believes in the course

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,880
cause which is to end poverty and to

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,560
reduce income inequality but there were

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,279
failings so we started

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,480
several programs uh we do um

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,680
formal training for individuals

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,800
several programs a year we do

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,519
uh co in coaching for teams

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,279
we do analysis of whole departments to

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,000
see where community can play

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,079
place and fourthly we have we have

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
mentorship from successful community

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,240
managers

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,519
mentoring other more junior managers so

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,639
i certainly believe

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,399
that it can be told

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,320
you still have that much you have to

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,639
have that motivation

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,639
but it still can be taught i mean the

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,839
way i got into it i

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,600
kind of fell into it through training

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,760
and um kind of a light bulb went on when

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
the answer to the question at the end of

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,360
training sessions what did you get most

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,440
out of the training was

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,279
meeting other people i realized

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,519
we never did anything before to

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,800
facilitate that collaboration we did a

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,480
little bit during

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,399
but after they were trained it was like

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,800
bye next class please

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,360
you know and now we have a much more

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,440
before during and after approach to

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
to training and and that's how i got

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,519
into community

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,279
and online community and you know i read

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,279
books and at the time

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,399
there was hardly any literature there

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,120
there were no

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,079
jonah bacon's at the time i had etsy and

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,079
wenger

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,480
you know that was my that was my bible

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,160
facilitating communities of practice

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,519
and i'm talking about communities of

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,600
practice not

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,199
uh online support communities open

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,000
development communities that kind of

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,680
thing

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,240
so at tim wengen then then it started

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,320
getting

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,560
uh much bigger with bill johnson and

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,759
richard millington at fever b

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,480
and david spinks at cr uh

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,480
as cmx and and now there's uh now if you

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,639
go to look for uh

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,480
works on community there's a a whole

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,639
slew of stuff and of course

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,079
two great books by jonah bacon i would

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,199
have to mention that

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:36,160
so uh so it definitely you know

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,360
um it definitely can be taught but

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,240
obviously it's going to be

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,160
much much better on top of motivation

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
and i will say one caveat at the world

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,199
bank

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,360
a lot of people are managing community

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,399
who are not community managers

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,279
and don't want to be community managers

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,000
and but you still have to give them some

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,880
tools

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,480
in which to enable them to have some

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,279
success at least and not

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,959
do the totally wrong thing uh come back

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,000
at the end of that say why isn't my

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,240
community working

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,600
well you know even welcoming people

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,679
who've joined you're not even saying

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,039
thank you for the first contribution

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,120
of course they're going to go away so

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,319
there's lots and lots and lots of

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,640
tips and techniques and and

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,439
other practical and technical things you

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,280
can do to help someone be a successful

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,039
uh the community leader which is

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,880
slightly different at the world bank or

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,559
a community manager which is

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,559
again slightly different than what

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,559
you're used to i think those two

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,720
roles are often combined at the bank

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,360
they're different

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,840
i i think thank you so much ray you you

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,080
bring up a really good point which is

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,320
uh community leadership and community

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,679
management really transcends technical

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,640
projects to

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,760
you know other problem-solving areas

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,799
such as what world

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,200
bank is trying to do and that

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,799
yes mentorship and formal mentorship

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,480
would really help

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,960
um and providing tools and techniques

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,880
that community managers can use is is

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,080
important as well

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,880
one of the things we try to do

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,280
where britney and i work we have a

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,080
couple of tools that we use we use slack

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,400
for example

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
to get our communities of interest

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,480
together

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,200
we do meetings um we

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,280
try to incentivize to the previous

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,320
discussion that jono had

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,280
um and and you know we we

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,400
need some uh tools and techniques to

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,080
make community

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,600
leaders successful this there's a whole

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,720
bunch of comments please

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,440
uh raymond yeah yeah i mean i

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,120
i definitely want a second like a lot of

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,640
comments that people made because i mean

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,720
most of my learnings came from other

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,799
community managers like at events like

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,280
cls or other open source conferences

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,720
you have hallway conversations follow up

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,360
on their sessions

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,880
and also i mean what i've noticed is

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,480
that a lot of people reach out to me on

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,080
linkedin because they're trying to form

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,200
a new community and they wanted to find

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,080
out how we did it at

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,960
my previous jobs and i really try to

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,400
make time

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,080
because i mean a lot of people help me

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,559
in my career it's like it's my

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,320
duty to help others that come along so

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,000
it doesn't have to be any formal like a

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,760
mentorship program just

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,280
make time available for people that want

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,320
to get started with

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,600
new communities or new ventures and i

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
really want to encourage people to do

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,520
that because

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,039
during the process i also learned

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,960
something because i mean they reach out

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,559
to me to learn what i did but

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,080
i find that about their approach and

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,240
their communities and

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,799
uh it's it's really worth worth

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:42,240
everybody's time i think

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,640
nikki can i jump in yes please hi

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,320
hi friends old and new hi i'm karsten

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,720
and um

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,160
um why what was i just thinking about

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,160
sorry my brain just derailed

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,679
so the the i just want to segue off the

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,080
communities of practice and what

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,520
um and and and to bring up some actually

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
i've got a community couple people here

00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,440
who are

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,840
writers in the community i wanted to

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,440
talk about but um

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:08,640
um what i was thinking about

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,400
sorry is that we uh

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,679
a number of years ago over the course of

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,799
the last two couple decades which is a

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,000
lot of stuff we talked about right i

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,280
mean i'm one of someone like like

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,720
nithian like everyone else who sort of

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,080
had to scrap this together

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,240
as i was figuring how to do community

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,880
management over the years and

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,240
um what i wanted to bring up was was to

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,600
follow up on what ray was saying about

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,960
communities of practice

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,640
is a uh and also in the sort of vein of

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,919
uh the carpenter's roof is leaking and

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,360
are we gonna get around to fixing our

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,400
own roof kind of thing

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,600
uh we our team at red hat

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,120
a dozen more years ago wrote a wrote a

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,640
book for our internal use that we then

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
open source called the open source way

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,039
and the

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,320
purpose of that was we're always

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,760
answering these same questions can we

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,200
write down these

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,640
not just the what and the how but the

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,919
why because the why is a really

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,360
important part that seems to get lost

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,480
these stories we all have

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,799
um and that's been out there for a

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,720
little while and last year we decided to

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,559
do the 2.0 version of the

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,840
of the guide to update it with the

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,320
evolution of way things have been and

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,400
i've

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,600
and um and and gordon and ray are

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,919
actually raymond

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,640
are both uh have chapters in the the

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,320
updated

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
or the upcoming version that's coming

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,720
out and what's really happened here

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,640
which was

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,840
what i was excited about hoping for so

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,200
much was that we would turn into a

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,400
community of practice

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,159
that there would be a lot more than just

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,600
like let's write a book and then see you

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,559
next year maybe we'll write another book

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,440
kind of thing

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,039
and um and this has come out of i know

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,880
for example directly that

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,400
um our open source program office at red

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,320
hat has begun to use

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,440
the com the open source way as an

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,919
upstream community

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,360
so when we're working on a white paper

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,120
about governance or

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,960
um or even some of the some of the

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,960
content that just came out around

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,400
red hat's open source practices that

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,000
were announced last week

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,600
um there you know all those things cross

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
inform each other and we consider the

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,720
open source way to be

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,400
the upstream for all those materials but

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,919
not as you know red hat stole that

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,799
stream but we really want to grow a

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,480
community there

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,000
and so i want to sting right now is

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,440
we've got a pretty good organizational

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,799
diversity of people

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,039
um individuals and groups um you know

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,159
probably nine or ten different sort of

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,440
things we're definitely getting that

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,880
community angle so i just wanted to

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,480
point it out and encourage people

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,640
um i'll drop a couple more links and

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,200
chat but that

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,559
we're actively working on the preview

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,840
release of the guide which should be out

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,760
by the end of this month and that will

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,640
include the introduction in several

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,080
chapters

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,640
um working on that in github and uh we

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,679
are a mega conversations are happening

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,880
on the

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,679
um the forum mailing list as well and

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,960
um yeah so that's i said this is also a

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,000
page for writers to anybody who's

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,240
looking down a little bit at the time

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,600
and

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,120
wants to go into github and pick up one

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
of the open chapters or sections we're

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,520
still

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,440
looking to close the loop on a few

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,600
things for that but the main thing is

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,039
going forward into next year

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,559
the community is going to going to

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,919
reboot itself under a new governance

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,520
it's going to figure it out kick me out

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,960
as project leader thank you and

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,280
figure out something that's that's more

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,679
and and just continue to constantly use

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,440
our own best practices and to just kind

00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,760
of keep repeating background on that

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,360
yeah

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,559
um and and i don't know that it's the

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,080
only community practice that has to

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,000
arise out of this i think that

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,600
there may be multiple angles to take but

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,799
this particular run around open source

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,240
software development and community

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,640
management thereof is a

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,840
you know kind of important subset of

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,679
things

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,679
thank you so much karsten um brittany

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,600
was just reminding us that

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,919
if you have any links to share if you

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,600
have any resources to share kindly

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,080
update it on the google docs so that we

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,120
can make it available to everybody

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,640
i heard yes mentorship is important and

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,559
then raymond also brought up

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,480
informal mentorship peer-to-peer

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,400
mentorship

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,559
i think it would be fantastic if those

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,679
of you i see some amazing

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,720
community managers here who can update

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,720
their twitter

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,880
or linkedin or whatever to say i'm

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,679
willing and able to mentor

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,200
uh or to help somebody that would then

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,440
signal to people

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,320
that you're you know available to be

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,720
contacted

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,919
and to you know for someone to ask you a

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,159
question

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,159
um

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,720
just very briefly on that note um i've

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,679
been experimenting with this a little

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,760
bit recently

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,279
so i did this community access bootcamp

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,640
a little while back which was a bunch of

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,600
training sessions

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,120
people joined it and um and then we kind

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,400
of got together in a slack community and

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,400
then also just

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,919
what's ongoing right now is as a book

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,600
club which is actually idea from some

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,640
community members who are reading people

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,320
powered

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,480
um so i think we tend to think of

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,320
mentoring as being very much one-on-one

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,600
um but i also think there's some great i

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,960
mean this i can imagine being really

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,559
great around the world that you're doing

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,400
cast and with the

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,400
with with the communities of practice

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,799
like getting people together for

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,640
joint sessions um and ray touched on

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,159
this earlier on as well just

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,760
um half the value is not just the

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,400
training it's the it's the

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,760
people as well that you're with so i i

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,200
think this would be amazing to do more

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,960
of that i'm certainly happy to volunteer

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,720
and help so

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,880
yeah um i was gonna add that i think the

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,840
um it's good to have books and it's good

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,360
to have like

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,279
a solid resources and repositories of

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,440
information but i i think

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,480
when i think about the work that we that

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
i did as a

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,919
community organizer doing local work in

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,640
massachusetts before

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,279
i came to free software we did a lot of

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,200
like this

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,279
like in-person trainings but we also

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,240
like shared new tips and techniques that

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,720
we learned

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,520
and we modeled like some of those things

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,520
in our

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,360
training sessions with each other and

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,039
then we took them back to our community

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,159
so it'd be like something

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,120
something really simple where uh there

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,120
was like one year

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,720
somebody said like at the end of this

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,240
meeting i'm gonna ask you what you

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,000
thought went well and what you didn't

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,720
think went well and it was like pluses

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,559
and deltas

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,799
and within a year like every single

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,240
meeting i went to had two minutes at the

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,840
end where people got to say

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,760
what went well about the meeting and

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
what didn't go well and i think that

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,520
feedback part is critical it's like the

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,840
piece that you need

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,679
to go with the static resources when

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,600
you're grafting in techniques and

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,360
strategies from another community

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,360
is you need to always be asking your

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,919
community like hey how is this working

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,159
for you

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,440
maybe we don't need 50 minutes to talk

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,200
about last year's thing

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,880
maybe we need five hours or maybe we

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,799
need five minutes but

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,720
you can't just always to take something

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,240
in from a different type of community a

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,320
different size community

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,159
and be like this is the best practice

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,279
you have to also do a little

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,120
fitting that's such a fantastic point

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,360
it's a living breathing science and

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,360
you've got to constantly be

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,760
seeing if it needs to be adjusted and

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,840
and to the earlier point we all made

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,159
communities are different needs are

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,000
different you need to constantly keep

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,840
adjusting you know what works what

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,840
doesn't um

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
any any other points on joshua you

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,279
joined us

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,320
as a panelist i it looks like you have

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:51,200
something that you want to share

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,159
oh i don't know i always wondering if i

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,640
should

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,240
please um formulate my thought more

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,600
before saying it which is what i was

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,480
doing there um

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,520
but what i was what's sort of turning

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,640
around in my head and

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,039
what dad made me think about is um

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,240
i've been at ieee standards association

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,480
for three years now

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,520
and when i first joined i thought it was

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,600
gonna and

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,360
it has been a lot of me teaching them

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,919
about open source

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,120
and what really surprised me is how much

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,799
i learned

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,960
to bring into open source from

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:28,640
this you know really rich standards

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,919
community with 130 year history

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,880
not only um you know

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,760
just being completely unaware that

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,919
there's been these communities

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,840
that are so similar to open source

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,679
communities and the problems and the

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,080
uniqueness or what i thought

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,039
of uniqueness to open source communities

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,399
dating back

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,320
you know um with you know

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,840
practically references to herding cats

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,279
back in like 1910

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,880
it was one of the first things i came

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,720
across and like

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,399
all of these personality types being

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,279
exactly the same

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,679
um doing consensus-based work um back

00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,840
then

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,360
and it was you know and all these geeky

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,760
things um

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,880
like the the morse society putting on a

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,080
dinner

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,159
um and at the turn of the century where

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,279
the whole menu was in morse code and it

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,840
was a tribute to

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,399
thomas edison and you know you're just

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,799
sort of these geeky little things that

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,720
i'm like wow and this is in our archives

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,559
at the ieee so that's you know

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,080
what i mean stumbling across these i

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,200
mean literally at work coming

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,720
across um you know

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,919
experiences and and things but then also

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,679
more practical

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,279
things not just sort of a sense of wow

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,960
that i'm a part of

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,799
sort of a much bigger thing than i

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,279
realized when it comes to

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,960
communities of practice and with that

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,080
has a lot of mix of

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,279
you know engineers and and

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,200
everything else it takes to put

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,120
something into the world not just

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,360
engineering

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,559
coming together to do things practical

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,960
but um

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,320
you know just basic things like uh

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,240
robert's rules of order

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,720
i kind of knew what it was i could kind

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,600
of fake my way through it before being

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,679
at a

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,240
uh ieeesa but when i started to realize

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,240
the

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,520
most important things about it for

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,799
instance

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,399
on a conversation one person speaks

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,159
bef you know and then everybody else

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,440
gets a chance to speak before speaking

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,960
again

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,880
all of a sudden that became like the

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,320
most important rule like things like

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,120
that started to be the more important

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,960
rules

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,520
um you know the people valuing an agenda

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,880
and and and you know if you do it long

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,039
enough

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,559
people come prepared to say oh you know

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,840
well i tried to get something odd but

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,159
now i'm really gonna take advantage of

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,080
this approval of the agenda phase

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,159
um just all sorts of little things about

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,399
how it changes the culture

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,320
and how you can sort of ratchet up how

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,120
strict you follow it versus how much you

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,399
ease off

00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:02,000
and you know when it's effective just

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:04,960
so many things and what's been nice

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,080
is being able to tie it to you know

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,840
learning these in a very similar culture

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,480
similar kinds of personalities and

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,200
things even though it's not open source

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,120
um and and then being able to apply it

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,840
and i'm hoping to be able to

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,080
you know pass along as much as i can but

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,000
also just bring in and start growing

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,720
community managers within

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,120
our current program and helping and

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,600
getting more people to experience

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,440
that and and you know so it's not just

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,480
my voice and my

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,520
disorganized way of explaining things

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,799
but other community managers who can

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,559
help share these stories

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,159
and get involved and um you know

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,279
projects like carson is working on and

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,840
what not to

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:52,799
to um you know transfer that learning

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,320
um joshua very well said and and you you

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,279
brought up a couple of very interesting

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,640
points

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,279
that there's been a history of the cat

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,360
herding

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,360
and you know other techniques that were

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,240
used in more formal

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,399
organizations like standards bodies and

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,360
program management for example inside

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,279
companies

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,559
and that we could learn a thing or two

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,320
and you know

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,240
maybe introduce some structure into

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,799
community management

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,399
which which can be adjusted based on

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,399
which community you're working with

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,360
can i jump in there uh that that

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,279
actually really ties into

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,000
uh what i wanted to touch on um

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,360
i i think it's wonderful that uh you're

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,279
literally digging up

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,240
documents of some of this history of how

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:44,799
communities were formed and

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:48,159
managed to some extent uh there's a

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,519
to some extent a a terminology that i

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,279
haven't heard

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,919
uh used as much and i don't know if

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,159
that's the industry doesn't go

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,760
for it as often or if it is missing

00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,399
somewhere but um

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,960
like a community engineer creating those

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,120
structures creating the documentation

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,399
that seems to be such a valuable part of

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,760
this

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:12,720
having those well outlined things that

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,760
have made the community successful an

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,840
example that

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,760
comes to mind is with old forms

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,399
moderators often new moderators would be

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,360
given like here's a list of 20 or 30

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,679
things that

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,000
create community engagement just put one

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,720
of these out there every few days

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,440
that that type of documentation is often

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,799
built up

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,480
over years but having it allows the

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,240
knowledge to be

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,000
one kind of adapted two different

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,240
communities but two

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,120
added upon as more and more community

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,559
managers become involved

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,440
that is fabulous point salt

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,159
i was just thinking about someone who i

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,919
knew

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,240
who called themselves a community

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,039
architect because they said

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,200
you really need to understand uh what

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,880
the needs of the community are

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,000
and then put the right structures and

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,399
engagement in place to keep the

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,279
you know community engaged and some of

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,399
what you're

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,200
describing is the science of engagement

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,519
and

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,480
uh what do we need to do to make that

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,600
happen

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,159
right and and in social media we often

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,120
do that

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,840
we say oh do you know your tweets on

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,480
this day

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,880
and you do the likes and retweets but

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,039
but

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:36,880
i haven't seen um maybe jonah you know

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,080
i haven't seen um a set of documents on

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,559
how do you

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,039
engage the community and how do you you

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,960
know continue to make it work

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,960
yeah yeah i think the tricky thing here

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,880
in my mind is

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,720
and someone mentioned it this early i

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,679
think sorry forgive me i forget who

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,279
mentioned this but

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,480
you know there are many different styles

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,840
and methods right at building

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,919
communities and i think that's what's so

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,440
exciting right now is

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,360
you know we're kind of we're all

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,559
building our library of ideas

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,360
and we're all coming at it from

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,360
different perspectives

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,240
which can make it a little challenging i

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,520
think for newcomers because they're

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,599
trying to figure out okay well which one

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,079
of these multiple resources do i start

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,040
with

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,720
um and i actually wanna if you don't

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,040
mind nithya to ask a question of the

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,040
group

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:26,240
yeah um we've talked about um mentoring

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,760
in these other areas and one of the

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,520
areas where i see

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,119
especially new community managers

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,599
struggling the most

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,800
is where you know getting everything set

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,000
up and up and running with a new

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,440
community

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,240
um is exciting and it's new and

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,359
um it's really motivating and then when

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,679
you launch it

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,480
um and then you get an initial influx of

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,919
people

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,399
and then it kind of starts to quieten

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,839
down a little bit and then

00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,760
sometimes then you don't see the growth

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,119
that you're anticipating or you go into

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,960
a company or

00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,640
an existing community and you're there

00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,839
to kind of revitalize the community and

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,960
what you're doing is not getting the

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,560
results that you want

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,000
to get and i i really i've been there

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,800
myself i'm sure most of us have been

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,320
there

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,680
and it can feel pretty um it can feel

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,520
pretty terrifying because you're

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,200
thinking okay well i can't tell people

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,160
what to do because i'm facilitating a

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,160
community

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,920
there are expectations of my performance

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,680
and what i'm here to do

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,960
um and i'm not seeing the results that

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,160
i'm getting and i've known a lot of

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,400
people and again i've

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,240
experienced this personally who have

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,119
been very very self-conscious and

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,760
nervous and

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,839
it's generating a lot of anxiety um and

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,839
we often don't talk about that

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,720
at cls we often talk about techniques

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,960
and practices and approaches and metrics

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,839
but i think helping like when people hit

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,320
that difficult

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,599
moment um i think some people are just

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,599
wired up in a way where

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,200
they can just say yeah it sucks right

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,800
now it's difficult but i'll battle i'll

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,720
battle on i'll get through it but other

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,560
people i think i think find it

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,079
uh much more challenging to kind of get

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,640
over that hump

00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,160
and i'm just curious how we go about

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,760
helping people with that because i think

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,440
often that can be when people quit

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,839
and then they don't come back and they

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,480
have a bit of almost like ptsd like they

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,920
just

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,599
it makes them very uncomfortable when

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,800
they think about what they experienced

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,160
and they don't necessarily want to come

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,440
back again so i just i'd love to get

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,640
everyone's thoughts about

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,480
how you manage that when you've

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,800
experienced that and how you've gotten

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,320
over the hump is it mentoring is it

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:27,040
getting away from it for a while i'd

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:31,359
love to learn

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,480
uh this is uh this is ray i've um

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,440
i think every we should um practice what

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,200
we preach

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,720
you know kind of reach out to our own

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,280
community

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,079
so i really found it helpful reaching

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,000
out you know

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,079
if i'm at a summit kind of reaching out

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,359
to people like you or richard millington

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,200
or david

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,200
or bill johnson all that kind of

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,119
luminaries and just

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,560
talking verbalize it and often just

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,599
verbalizing

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,280
verbalizing it helps uh

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,680
speaking with somebody else that's

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,400
already be there being there

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,839
are just a fresh set of eyes it's

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,040
amazing

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,960
when you're in a when you're when you're

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,320
in a hole it's hard to see anything but

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,359
the walls

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,119
you know you need someone

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,640
at the top of the wall looking in and

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,200
say hey what are you doing down there

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,320
there's a

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,160
there's blue sky and and fields and

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,359
and beauty going on around here and just

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,760
getting another set of eyes uh yeah

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,480
and when i when i'm thinking wenger has

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,960
always helped me essien wenger

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,720
both his book so he divides the

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,720
community communities of practice

00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,920
you should look at three aspects uh he

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,320
calls them

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,200
uh domain community and practice i call

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,200
it purpose

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,599
people and process and very often we're

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,720
stuck

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,480
in a whole looking at one side saying oh

00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,320
my content's terrible

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,920
it's yeah i've got their own content

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,560
where i need to get more content

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,160
doing and it's not really the content

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,839
it's the people you've got the wrong

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,440
you're addressing the wrong audience the

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:06,320
audience has moved on

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,200
or is the process and and the process

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,280
came

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,320
really vividly this time with kobe

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,480
because we had uh

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,480
the several communities we were focused

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,960
on face to face

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,880
and like that went away so we got to do

00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,440
something else so

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,280
i would i would counsel that you know

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,680
first off somebody else

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,400
and sue if you if you're still on your

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,280
own

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,839
try isolating into those three buckets

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,640
purpose people and practice and seeing

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,400
in fact is it something else that you is

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,599
there something else that's a problem

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,599
not the one you're thinking of

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,200
ray could you kindly add the names of

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,119
the

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,480
authors that you mentioned and the books

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,720
that you mentioned

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:54,079
that you found oh yes i uh

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,440
i have a whole shelf full but let's say

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,560
this one is the one

00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,200
is it backwards it's facility i'll write

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,280
it down

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,040
it's cultivating community to practice

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,680
by etienne wenger

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,920
uh it's my bible it's like 30 years old

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,800
but it's still

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,440
the book to go to thank you so much all

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,839
right

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,200
i'll write it in the chat and in the um

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,680
thank you ray

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,040
in the document perfect i think the

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,720
point you also brought up

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,839
is uh how we can be a support community

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,480
to each other

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,560
and not just uh for knowledge sharing

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,359
but for emotional support

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,000
and to bounce back and to kind of build

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,359
up our

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,240
reserve again right um that was an

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,400
excellent point

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,280
i know we have about two minutes left

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,720
folks

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,599
so any any other best practice that we

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,200
missed uh capturing and thank you

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,520
brittany for capturing

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,640
all of the ideas that came out of this

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,680
uh if you could do

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,760
a readout please at five o'clock on some

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,760
of the aha moments and some of the thank

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,000
yous or i can do the readout as well

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,480
i'm still technically on my day off this

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,200
is my last day off of vacation so i'm

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,200
going to

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,680
give out yes yes

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,839
i i did have one one more thing that i

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,720
thought were maybe bringing up

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,280
and that's that uh there are techniques

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,760
that

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,720
can be gathered from different groups

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,800
and

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,839
uh that are maybe not in our space at

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,920
all

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,599
for instance i saw a talk about

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,440
some of the occupy wall street

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,000
organizers and the way they did

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,200
deliberation and hand signals they used

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,920
i've since taken those modified them to

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,680
a

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,160
kind of a antsy or ascii art online

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,480
emoticon context and use them in the

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,119
meetings for how to identify

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,160
uh who should be speaking what you feel

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,200
about topics and the idea was how do you

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,400
sit in a room with a hundred people and

00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,480
have them all have quick responses

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,839
that that's not like the tech community

00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,160
but by

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,200
using those techniques and looking for

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,280
them elsewhere

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,800
and seeing where they've been successful

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,200
including where they've been successful

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,920
for self-care type things

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,000
we can then try to see if they work for

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,000
us

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,160
fabulous thank you salt

00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,640
there's so many places that we can bring

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,760
it to and also so many places we can

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,720
apply

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,240
uh the power of community uh engineering

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,319
community leadership community

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,680
management right to solve problems

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:38,640
not just in coding so thank you all

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,880
um we're at 4 45 thank you all for

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,319
participating so actively

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,880
and so vigorously i think we learned

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,839
community managers are not born sorry

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,119
not made

00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:53,200
they're born but then there are

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,800
a number of resources that we can offer

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,680
to help them

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,200
you know do their job better and to grow

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,560
and to

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,800
become all they can be we'll do a wrap
