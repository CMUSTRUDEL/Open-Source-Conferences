Presented at All Things Open 2020, Community Leadership Summit

Abstract: In this discussion we will explore how to identify, foster, and support the success of new community leaders. Not everyone in a community will be a naturally leader, and often great leadership can come from unexpected places. We would love to hear your ideas how to foster leadership, provide guidance, best practice, mentoring, and more. Be sure to join us!
