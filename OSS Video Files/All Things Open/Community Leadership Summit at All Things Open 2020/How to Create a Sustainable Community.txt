Abstract: Many communities struggle to support themselves, either with enough contributors, or with generating enough money to support infrastructure, travel, merchandise, and other costs. In this session we want to discuss how to build truly sustainable communities. What should we focus on most? How should we generate resources and how do we effectively manage them? We would love to hear your insight!
