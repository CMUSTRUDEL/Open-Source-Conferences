Presented at All Things Open 2020, Community Leadership Summit

Abstract: Many communities struggle to support themselves, either with enough contributors, or with generating enough money to support infrastructure, travel, merchandise, and other costs. In this session we want to discuss how to build truly sustainable communities. What should we focus on most? How should we generate resources and how do we effectively manage them? We would love to hear your insight!

	00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,480
so

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,719
today's session we are going to talk

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,599
about how to create a sustainable

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,840
community

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,160
and i thought i might start by asking

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,800
folks well first let's uh

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,720
let me give you the uh requisite

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,199
uh document so that people can take

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,000
notes or uh or write stuff down

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,000
or just go and you can i'll place that

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,119
into the chat for everybody oh okay um

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,600
or if you

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,920
you mention a resource uh that is a url

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
um maybe drop it in the chat but also in

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
the document so that folks can take a

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,280
look

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,079
um and so i guess first i wanted to ask

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,760
what people

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,440
think what sustainability means to them

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,559
in the context of like a

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,160
open source project does anyone want to

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,079
say something about the word

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,199
sustainability and how that

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,320
how that means what that means to them

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,840
i want to make sure we're on the same

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,199
page because otherwise we might be

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,720
talking about more than one type of

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,920
sustainability which might not be the

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,640
type

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
that you came for um oh we've got some

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,000
good stuff in the chat

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,119
um doesn't break the stakeholders or

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,880
community members

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,479
uh brains um having enough contributors

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,280
not burning out maintainers

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,040
sustainability equals survival

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,159
a project where people don't disappear

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
when they're needed that's a really

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,200
interesting one

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,280
um a project that can continue

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,240
developing software

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,920
supportive uh and supporting uh founders

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,960
can walk away and it remains

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,479
okay uh and long term okay so we have a

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,840
lot of stuff about

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:47,119
burnout uh and

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,479
not having it uh we have a lot of things

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,600
about people feeling

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,079
uh supported and we have a lot of stuff

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,280
about

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,360
um longevity uh which

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,799
is really interesting and um

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,640
yeah and uh i would say

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,000
that some of those things are all kind

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,399
of coming in with the um

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,039
the idea that that more than one person

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,160
is holding

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,080
power in the organization so um

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,720
like jono is central as he is to cls

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,640
if he left and said i'm gonna do uh i'm

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,879
gonna finally pursue my lifelong dream

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,040
of

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,319
pottery i'm done with all this open

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,480
source stuff

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,680
probably someone would step up and do

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,720
cls

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,800
i would hope um it's uh

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,560
you know they might ping him and be like

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,280
oh can you introduce me to that nice

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,040
todd guy

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,560
but other than that i think it would

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,200
happen without him

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,040
so um so i think those kinds of things

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,840
about like separating

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,519
um power from like and the identity of

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
the project from a single person into

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,000
like a group

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,160
and then how we do that um and so we

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,920
we sort of like frame this conversation

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,120
so it's like how to create a sustainable

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,159
community

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,959
um you don't always get the chance to do

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,239
a community

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,159
right from square one but if you do

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,280
you can put in a lot of great stuff at

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,840
the beginning

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,840
um so i don't know if people want to

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,760
talk about like some of the ways that

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,440
they have found for sharing power within

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,640
their organizations so that you don't

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,920
end up with like the

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,200
the one person show which yeah

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,959
kind of used to be one of those things

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,640
that we did a lot more of at the

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,599
beginning of free and open source

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,360
software and have now found

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,120
doesn't really make everybody super

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,400
happy later on

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,720
um especially even the best of us come

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,760
with some baggage

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,360
yeah so actually on that note deb i

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,840
would love to get a sense of

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,200
where everybody here has experienced

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,640
that because i think you're right like

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,560
leadership

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,239
solid open source leadership is critical

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
but also doing it in a way that

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,000
that i mean i know we've got another

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,640
session lately today on on facilitating

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,480
leaders but uh what has been that

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
experience that people have got here

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,920
and in the impact of leadership on

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,519
sustainability because we've got a lot

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,760
of things in here like

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,959
sufficient involvement by user community

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,360
low barrier to entry

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,479
you know and leaders are kind of

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,280
critical right in

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,560
helping to create that environment so

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,479
any thoughts any thoughts from our

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,639
panelists lisa marie

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,960
yeah i'm happy to say something on this

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,560
um you know it's funny i think

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
if jono did leave cls um i do believe it

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,040
would

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,040
contain it would continue but i think

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
you'd have to appoint the next person

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,560
what i have found

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,840
is that those leaders don't always just

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
step up now maybe they would for

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,080
something like cls because it's such a

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
great thing

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,600
but you know i've been involved in other

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,280
communities like with the openstack

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
community i tried to give that away

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,600
multiple times and we had built you know

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,520
the world's largest openstack user group

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
and i didn't want to let it just die

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,440
and so i like would reach into the

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,199
community and hand appoint people

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,720
but they wouldn't really stay because it

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,240
is a lot of work to do

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,160
and it wasn't something at that point

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
that we were generally getting paid by a

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
corporation to do

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320
we're doing it as a volunteer kind of

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,240
nights and weekends thing

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
um so instead of finding someone to run

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,360
that i just took that community into

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,440
kubernetes and containers and

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,560
kept it going in a different part of the

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
ecosystem

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,600
but i think if you don't hand select the

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,400
next

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,759
you know leader and multiple people

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,680
because people do drop out

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,600
then i don't think it always happens on

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
its own

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,680
i love that point lisa and i think that

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,080
there's a

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
sort of a and in there like the hand

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,960
selecting

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,800
i was part of a project where we had

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,840
like one amazing person

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,880
we'll call her jessica and um and she

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,919
was gonna leave

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,919
and move you know to another place and

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,840
uh you know so for like two or three

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,400
weeks the whole project was like where

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,919
are we ever gonna find another jessica

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,840
and i'm like she was doing like 80

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,000
different things we're

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,120
not going to find one more jessica we're

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,240
going to find

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,639
10 people maybe to do one small piece of

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,440
what

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,160
she was doing and so we you know you

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
can't

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,919
like if you've been with the projects

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,840
from the beginning for like five years

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,360
you can't just find another person

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,120
waiting in the wings to take on

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,000
everything at once you're gonna have to

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,000
like break it up

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,120
um good documentation i see in the

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,919
uh notes is also really good for handing

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,120
things off

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,120
and for ensuring um

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,880
you know that you people are allowed to

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,280
leave without people

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,039
like pestering them on vacation or when

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,319
they're in the middle of having a baby

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,319
for the github

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,759
password and stuff like that this

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,400
actually kind of raises an interesting

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
point because

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,880
shen ting ang writes in the chat good

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,960
documentation as well so for contributor

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,080
leaves there's still continuity

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,919
what would everybody here say

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,639
is essential to put into that

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,479
documentation like what are the critical

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,319
because nobody likes writing docs right

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,120
as a general rule people

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,479
are busy with other things um what does

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,319
everybody think and i'd love to see this

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,759
in the chat as well as well like what

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,199
if someone's going to create a document

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,400
that's like here's how you continue the

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,840
leadership because

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,840
you know businesses talk about business

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,919
continuity continuity planning

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,120
um what should be in that for a for a

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,880
community

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,560
i'd love to see any thoughts in the chat

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,560
or panelists here

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
oh andy says he's got oh he has to write

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,880
a document

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,880
for his project

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,560
uh one of the things that i have found

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,800
is incredibly critical

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,840
is that the documentation is written in

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,160
c2

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,120
and then given to a third party to make

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
sure it actually

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,560
makes sense is understandable and it's

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,840
relatively easy

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,400
because the person creating the

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,080
documentation

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,919
is usually also the person who

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,520
understands every single in and out of

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,280
the project

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,639
so it becomes very very difficult to

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,280
understand what's that

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,360
small hurdle that no one would have

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,080
possibly expected a newcomer to get

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,080
caught off on

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,879
yeah i think that's really key and

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
encouraging people to do the

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,360
documentation

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,319
as they go like so when you like

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,840
one thing you can do is ask a person

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,960
who's taking on a new project to

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,400
document what they did

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,879
and where they got stuck rather than

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,560
waiting till like five years later like

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,639
oh can you write up something that

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,639
brand new people would read because

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,240
you're just not capable of it five years

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,120
in

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,519
just before andy dips in i think andy i

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,719
i

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,680
think you were gonna say something but

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,120
i'm not sure i don't wanna put you on

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,360
the spot but i just wanna make sure you

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,839
can

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,440
speak um so my really quick thing i

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,080
wanted to say was i found a lot of

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,240
success

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
in um bringing in new members regularly

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,120
if you can bring in new leaders

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,399
regularly people don't get entrenched in

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,800
rules quite so much

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,800
but you really gotta in my experience

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,519
take that on as a regular recurring

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,560
thing

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,680
or else you're just not going to get

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,560
around to doing it yeah yeah

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,240
yeah that's a great point what i wanted

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,920
to get on to say

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,680
i have to admit i have not taken on a

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,640
leadership role in an open source

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,560
community

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,480
but i've done a lot of other non-profit

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,680
sorts of things and these are very

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,279
similar because

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,880
people don't want to take on leadership

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,120
roles they want to do their thing

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,120
and they don't see the need to take a

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,680
high level view you have to persuade

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
them

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,279
so first you have to know what kind of

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,279
leadership you need you might need

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,600
someone with financial expertise with

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,720
legal expertise you know

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,880
fundraising expertise so you want to

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
go out and recruit the right people and

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,920
then you want to think about leadership

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,839
succession right away

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,760
because somebody's going to drop out

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,600
without much warning because you know

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,519
illness in the family or something and

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,920
you want to be prepared to move people

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,160
up

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,120
so i always tell people to think about

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,200
this on an ongoing basis

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,800
the nonprofit point's a really good one

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,640
and i feel like a lot of

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,560
when i see like healthy non-profits and

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,959
they have officer rules and things like

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,160
that

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,760
like they'll have a treasurer but

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
they'll have an assistant treasurer and

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,800
that person

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,399
gets cc'd on everything it might be a

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,640
little less work at the beginning

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,920
but if the you know official treasurer

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,680
had to leave then the assistant

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,600
treasurer could step in

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,040
um and you might have the same for like

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,320
big committees that are

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,160
you know you would have a chair and a

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,560
vice chair so that there's always a

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,560
second

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,360
so um bruce

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,920
shares a link to esip

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,720
fed um about which is taking their

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,560
documentation

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,040
seriously i'll put that link into the

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,480
into the into the document so we can all

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
share that but that sounds pretty

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,000
interesting

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,839
um also heather is saying that

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
openstreetmap foundation is

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,480
going through a state of flux right now

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,839
they want to be more global but there is

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,959
a high burnout and different views in

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,959
the next steps for the future the

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,920
project somewhat more structure

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,200
someone organic 10 years in um people

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,480
are leaving and now finally some of the

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,880
board members are helping shine this

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
light

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,640
i think heather raises a really

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,640
interesting question there in

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,160
setting direction right is that a lot of

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,279
open source projects especially just

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,800
tend to naturally kind of wander forth

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,320
um and sometimes you can kind of get

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,920
like a lot of

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,360
there's not really a nice way of saying

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,000
this but you know like how people talk

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,200
about technical

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,440
debt i think sometimes some communities

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,600
can just get a little bit stale

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
and they need a bit of a refresh or a

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,360
reboot but it can sometimes be difficult

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,800
to do that because

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,880
you know you've been doing it forever

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,399
the same way

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,680
i'd love to get a sense from everybody

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,959
like how you've approached that like for

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,519
example we had

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,519
that to a degree in ubuntu years ago um

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,640
like the project was just

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,160
we were doing the same thing over and

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
over again but we wanted to kind of

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,160
spread out into new areas

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,040
and that was a little different because

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,760
you know mark shawworth is kind of the

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,440
the uh spiritual mascot of that project

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,720
in many ways

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,880
but um i'm just curious tricky with a

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,839
spiritual mascot of a project

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,240
it's it like people are like i think it

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,160
makes when you have one person

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,440
you know especially with a strong

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,240
personality

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,600
at the top like folks look at themselves

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,760
and they're like well i'm going to mark

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,560
shuttleworth like obviously i can't be

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,279
in charge of

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,800
stuff and i think that makes it really

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,480
it's it's like the more

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,240
able the more we're able to model that

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,240
there's room for lots of different kinds

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,639
of people and i think

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,440
one place i can start is making sure

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,920
that

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,160
you know when someone says like oh lake

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,760
can you send someone over from xyz

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,079
project to present

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,000
instead of like flying the founder of

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,480
your organization from australia

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,720
to like new england you're like oh we

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,440
actually like susan lives in boston like

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,680
you could just

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,120
like have her take a bus i mean you know

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,800
in the before times but

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,839
um it's even easier like you can

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,800
uh like virtually so like you have to

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,560
i think the spiritual mascots have to

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,440
step out of the way a little bit

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,800
yeah i agree i don't know if other folks

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,880
have experience with that

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,120
because that sounds like like when i say

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,880
that in the abstract like oh xyz

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,240
like spiritual mascot just has to step

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,240
out of the way but

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,160
i think in practice that's probably been

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,800
more difficult i don't know if anyone

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,360
is willing to share their experiences on

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,480
uh

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,720
either success or stumbling block

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
there

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,120
yeah any thoughts anyone on this uh

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,760
elizabeth

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,040
uh elizabeth would you like me to add

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,399
you in as a panelist or do you want to

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
just chat in the uh

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,000
in the chat let us know yeah let's put

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,560
her on

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,480
well i can say that i've heard on

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,240
several projects that someone says

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,000
oh there's no point in me trying to

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,760
break into the inner circle

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,040
the inner circle they don't know each

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,800
other they have their own

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,240
culture and often the people in the

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,839
inner circle are desperate

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,680
to get people to break in and they might

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,880
not realize that they're putting up a

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,399
barrier

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,120
because just the way they interact with

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,920
each other yeah

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,959
i agree so here's elizabeth i was just

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,000
gonna say that i think

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,000
that those spiritual mascots um i think

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,519
they need to be convinced

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,839
to not have the answer you know i think

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,199
it's

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,079
really important i i'm i'm a leader and

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,000
i've been working very hard to carve off

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,720
pieces of my job and hand them to other

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,399
people

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,920
so that hopefully by the time i step

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,959
away entirely

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,480
the last piece i'm i'm i'm handing off

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:35,600
will be a piece that one person can take

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
um but part of that is that you know

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,279
when i

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,360
um we agree that mike is going to take

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,720
on this one project and people will keep

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,240
coming back and saying

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,680
yeah but what does elizabeth think and

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,000
it's really important that elizabeth

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,240
says

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,399
i think you should talk to mike i think

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,720
mike has really good ideas i think

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,760
mike is really in control of this and

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,040
sort of not

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,040
and and to to get the the leadership on

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,120
board and understand that it's not about

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,240
marginalizing them or not valuing what

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,279
they have

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,399
but it's about trusting the the other

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,680
people in the group

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,839
and um and and making sure that

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,440
that you are backing those people up and

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,760
not undermining them

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,880
because ask elizabeth she always knows

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,160
is not a succession plan

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,000
so yeah you know

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,079
elizabeth on that on that note like i

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,120
think that's such a valuable point and i

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,560
think one element

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,959
of uh i mean i think we we all know

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
that like being part of being a great

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,720
leader is

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,920
um is enabling empowering other people

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,320
to be successful

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,839
um but i think there is like an

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,279
emotional connection a lot of people

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,639
have to their projects and i think

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,440
sometimes that can be really difficult

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,600
to break

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,440
um and sometimes we don't provide enough

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000
guidance i think to leaders for how to

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,120
do that

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,120
because you know i mean yeah

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,880
i'm not going to deny i mean i think

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,240
debbie is the example of like i stopped

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,800
doing cls

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,079
i'd be i'd absolutely want to hand not

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,199
hand over the reins because it's not

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,759
really that way but

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,519
make sure that it can continue but i'd

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,000
be very opinionated about how

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,959
how it was run um and that's not

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
necessarily the right

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,759
approach or the right idea and that's

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,920
gotta impact the sustainability of

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,040
communities right so

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,560
um any thoughts on how

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,440
to enable leaders to not be okay with

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,440
not having the answers

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,399
i have always advocated and i think this

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,199
is incredibly important

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,560
not just as a leader in a leadership

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,680
role but also as someone

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,399
moving forward in a community um

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,040
make sure that your information diet is

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,199
shoving

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,320
new information at you even when you

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,320
don't want to consume it

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,279
hmm

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,360
um i i just wanted to say that um

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,320
it's the hardest transition for anyone

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,079
to make to go

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,240
from doing to becoming a leader

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,439
and when you become a leader sometimes

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,640
um you forget that your job is to groom

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,280
and develop everybody around you

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,959
and to to kind of invest in making

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,439
leaders around you

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
and elizabeth you know illustrated it

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,720
really really

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,280
well you have to stop and say it's not

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,000
only about me now it's about the people

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,280
around me

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and i need to give them opportunities to

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,960
contribute and and become part of the

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,200
project

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,200
so i love this train of thought

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,799
yeah i would guess and that too and say

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,760
that

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,480
um it means that sometimes if you were

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,280
running a

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,080
like a subcommittee meeting that you

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,080
might instead

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,000
of showing up every time because like

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
inevitably everyone will look and be

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,280
like

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,799
well what does nydia think and like you

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,160
just have to like i think sometimes you

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,080
have to say like oh i'm not going to

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,360
those meetings anymore because i put

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
you know mike in charge and um i won't

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,160
be there

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,679
so like you can't ask me you can't look

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,000
at my face and see if i'm like

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,880
oh i wouldn't do it like that you know

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,799
just not

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,720
like you have to actually sometimes

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,360
physically step back

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,600
i mean as much as physical means in this

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,600
time

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
i'm just looking through some of the

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,520
earlier dev when you asked about

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,320
what people think of when they think of

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,160
sustainability and

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,360
a couple of things that people pointed

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,240
out a project where people don't

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,320
disappear

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,600
while they're needed was from andy um

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,880
sustainability equals

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,320
um survival from jacinto having enough

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,679
contributions not burning out

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,280
maintainers

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,039
doesn't break the stakeholders or

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,760
community members brains to run it and

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,880
it seems like

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,640
the common theme to a lot of these is a

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,880
healthy environment for people to

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,240
contribute and participate and i wonder

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,919
whether we should dig into that a little

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,679
bit and explore

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,440
how you do that because we often hear

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,120
that the horror stories of people

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,799
burning out and

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:06,080
you know being overwhelmed um how do we

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,280
enable how do we enable people to be

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,840
able to contribute

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,799
to a level of comfort that's right for

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,240
them

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,600
yeah that's something you think we

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,080
should dig into i don't want to overtake

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,919
your set

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,919
no no i would i think that's a really

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,799
interesting one and the burnout is like

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,080
it's it's like sort of there's like

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,799
there's a couple things in there there's

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,960
like setting

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,480
an expectation so like if you sign up

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,160
and you're like cool i'll come to one

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,559
meeting a week and then

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,200
you turn out to be like not you know

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,520
fairly

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,960
responsible and and then everyone

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,679
invites you to all the meetings and it's

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,880
like oh no

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,200
no no like you know you have to

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,120
i think you want to say like oh no no no

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,360
the goal is not for

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,960
like us to find the new person that's

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,919
the least busy and make them do

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,400
every single thing um i think another

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,600
thing

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,200
uh projects um with a lot of volunteer

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,880
time like they

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,400
you know like we talked about strategic

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
planning and so i think folks make these

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
big

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,799
plans and then they're like well someone

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,840
has to do it

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,159
and then the person that steps up for

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,600
that

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,960
does it in the short term but they don't

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,000
feel good about it and they don't stick

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,400
around

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,880
like i think organizations that have a

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,640
lot of volunteers have to be like

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,960
you know what we're not going to have a

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,039
14 day circus event we're gonna have

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,720
like a three hour zoom or a three hour

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,919
jitsie and that's it

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,760
like you know as nice of an idea as that

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,200
is like so someone has to be willing to

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,280
say like

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,400
that sounds like an awesome 20-year

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,440
anniversary

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,520
thing but not a two-year like let's get

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,640
our 40 people together thing

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,159
and so like yeah that's so yeah so i

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,559
think controlling the scope a little bit

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,080
and then

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,000
also like setting expectations for

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,400
contributors um

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,080
so that it's there's no like well sure

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
would be great if someone did that

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,159
because

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,760
uh there's someone every day that has

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,320
not been that someone before and they're

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,760
gonna do it and they're gonna regret it

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,000
yeah i don't know there's a lot of good

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,240
comments in here um

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,080
about self-assessment i don't know

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,480
daniel if you want to speak more about

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,880
the

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,919
self-assessment we could put you on the

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,400
yeah we can switch

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,280
we can we can bring you into the gallery

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,360
if you want daniel

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,320
no pressure in the meantime this is lisa

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,400
again can i just

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,360
um say something before you move off the

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,679
burnout thing

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,520
i think motivating the community and

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,960
motivating the next leaders to step up

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,760
is is a huge thing but it's also um

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,679
you know events like cls are so

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,280
important for doing things like that for

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,799
bringing community people together for

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,080
people realizing you know you're not in

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,640
this alone there are so many other

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,039
people

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,080
who are doing this and bouncing ideas

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,760
off each other

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,000
john you have that talk about the 12

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,080
steps of burnout that was a lifesaver

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,080
for me because i didn't even realize i i

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,039
was a like stage 11 or something

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,919
ridiculous

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,360
and um and i was totally unknown to me

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,559
and i remember you kind of nudging me in

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,640
the hallway going you know lisa you

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,039
should really be in this talk

00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,919
just just be there for me moral support

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,280
and i'm like sitting there

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,039
okay i'll do that for you john but then

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,120
i'm like sitting there going oh my gosh

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,159
you know so just doing events like this

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,480
um there's a

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,240
new woman on my team named emruta who

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,720
well my new team i just joined cockroach

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,640
labs

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,760
a couple weeks ago um i don't think

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,600
she's ever been to a conference like

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,559
this and i really encouraged her you

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,159
know to take the day

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,320
and to attend as many sessions as you

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,760
can and meet as many people as you can

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,480
and i'm not sure if she's in this talk

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,159
right now

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,080
and if you're here i'd encourage you to

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,880
introduce yourself but doing things like

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,200
this

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,480
really gives people the it rejuvenates

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,240
people and it gives you that kind of

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,799
next six months of oxygen

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,000
to go back to your community and to put

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,000
in the energy and the time and the

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,679
effort

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,520
yeah i think connection is really

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,080
important uh does anyone else want to

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,440
talk about

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,440
um burnout

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,280
i actually just spent um and jono kind

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,720
of knows the

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,880
uh back end but for my day job i

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,159
just uh went on vacation i had to

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,840
schedule

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,559
a mental health breakdown

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,320
a month in advance because i was so

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,919
integral and so important to the brand

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,919
new processes that we put into place

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,080
regarding virtual events

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,679
and i was the only one who could manage

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,000
the analytics who was sending out the

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,240
emails who was doing all of the stuff

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,360
and on one hand yeah that's all

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,159
documented

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,559
and on one hand yeah i have a great team

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,400
but

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,559
there's only four of us capable of

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,520
working within that department set

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,840
and even if i were to cross train people

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,159
it just wouldn't be possible for

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,600
my workload to be laid on to the other

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,960
three people

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,640
so it kind of reached a point where it's

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,679
like all right we need to feel

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,080
okay having a failure and

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,919
not sending emails for a week because

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,559
that burnout

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,000
is more important than ensuring that

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,000
productivity is 120

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,880
i think that's really important like the

00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,279
yeah like scoping it back and being like

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
oh

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,440
you know we were gonna do this three

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,880
times a year and it's like

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,159
we have only four people and we can only

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,640
do it two times a year

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
whatever it is you know like we we're

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,240
we're not gonna

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,520
we're not gonna set expectations for

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,760
ourselves that are

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,320
everybody here 50 hours a week with no

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,320
weeks off

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,840
and that's hard because it sounds

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,200
exciting it's not like when you're like

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,400
what are we going to get done before the

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,640
end of the year it sounds really

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,960
exciting to make a giant list

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,159
but um then when you actually try to do

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,679
it it's kind of

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,880
it's it's not so fun uh so there's a

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,039
video about burnout

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,559
is that oh you're at oh aren't you jonah

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,720
yeah i'm ato ato

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,000
sounds like a star wars character um

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,120
yeah

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,720
so i i recorded a video on youtube

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,880
um of what i learned about it because i

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,520
i burned out a number of years ago and

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,720
it was

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,279
a bit of a revelation i had no idea

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,640
about it

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,640
and um so um

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,080
you know it's interesting lisa marie

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,640
talking about it because

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,360
uh i used to do this talk about burnout

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,799
years ago

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,320
and the basic gist is that from stages

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,400
one to twelve it gets progressively

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,559
worse not everybody hits every step

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,240
um in the burnout cycle and i'd ask the

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,320
audience to just think privately

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,679
what level they've got to and it's

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,360
amazing how many people will come over

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,360
to me at the end of the session and say

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,880
you know i'm kind of at like a seven or

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,000
an eight which is

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,720
really not a great place to be um and

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,159
they just

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,039
there wasn't like a language for

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,039
understanding what they were

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,120
experiencing which is why i found when i

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,880
discovered it it's so valuable so

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,640
it's not exactly the same thing in that

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,240
video i just share but i think if if any

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,480
of you are experiencing burnout right

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,720
now then it might be useful

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,919
well and i think too like i i've also

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,000
been there on some of this

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,440
i don't have a video to share but um i

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,240
do have a personal list

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,480
for myself for things that i have noted

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,559
when i've been like wow this

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,480
this particular experience is really

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,440
terrible and i never want to be here

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,960
again

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,120
and i wrote down some of the

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,720
anti-patterns that i saw

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,520
in the projects and i was like i am

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,000
never joining another project that

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,039
boasts about how we don't sleep

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,919
i am never joining another project where

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,559
they say

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,559
uh you know we call each other names

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,919
because it keeps us motivated

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,840
you know and so you might want to make a

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,000
personal list for yourself of things

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,320
that you do not want to

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,840
that you know that let you know it's a

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
project you're not interested in being

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,400
involved with

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,640
and then when you start your own

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,720
projects you can say like hey we're not

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,559
going to brag about never sleeping and

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,960
we're not going to call each other names

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,640
because that creates an environment that

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,320
i don't want to be any part of

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,159
and i don't want to be creating for

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,640
other people i don't know if other folks

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,480
have

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,120
like things that they have seen red

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,360
flags um

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,360
rules that they learned the hard way for

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,400
things that they think are anti-patterns

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,400
that they would like to share

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,720
i think just to add to what you said deb

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,960
um

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,940
a little bit of introspection is really

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,120
helpful to know

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,679
[Music]

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,000
where you feel you thrive and where you

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,960
don't thrive and where you're unhappy to

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,400
your point

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,080
you know the kinds of projects you're

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,120
unhappy about and

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,000
uh and to avoid that and and to make

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,279
sure that you're taking

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,279
care of yourself uh at all times right

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,200
some of the people that i work with are

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,159
introverts and they say

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,640
you know they try very hard not to

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,200
commit

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,320
overcommit or be in all of the sessions

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,440
be in all of the

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,760
hallway tracks and and just burn out

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,320
particularly at an event and to you know

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,720
just go back to the room it's okay

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,279
to go back and and kind of relax and

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,679
refresh and come back

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,200
one more point i wanted to make is we

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,840
are trying to document

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,200
all of the roles and all of the work

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,320
content for

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,720
different roles in my team

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,480
because we were seeing that some people

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,799
were burning out and we wanted to make

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,440
sure that we cross trained everybody

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,720
and anyone could jump in right and avoid

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,720
the bus factor

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,720
and the same holds true for projects as

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,000
well

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,480
yeah i see a couple folks talking about

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,279
uh setting quiet hours for themselves

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,720
and

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:25,840
um yeah um

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,320
oh and another red flag like

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,320
um

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,640
as a scrum master uh i don't know if you

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,840
want to elaborate on that

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,039
it went past just now but um

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,679
israel if you wanted to elaborate on the

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,640
solving problems like for people so is

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,880
that like where

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,000
uh folks are giving you their problems

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,840
to solve

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,600
yeah and israel if you want me to add

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,919
you as a panelist let me know i'm happy

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,640
to

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,919
add you if you want to speak um like or

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,440
whatever you don't have to put video on

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,919
no one has to put video on by the way

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,799
whatever you feel most comfortable okay

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,320
right now and

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,919
it's going to restart zoom and you'll be

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,120
back in in just just a sec

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,880
one second i saw also diversity

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,399
and and ninja was talking about

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,240
different uh

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,520
rules and different team members and i

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,600
think

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,360
you know one of the one of the it's like

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,320
they're all a little bit related like

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,120
sometimes

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,360
um if you ask everybody to do everything

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,919
like if you ask a coder to take like a

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,120
half

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,799
a day out to like design a logo like

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,080
one you're probably not unless you're

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,600
real lucky you're not going to get an

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,080
amazing logo but

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,039
you're also not going to have someone

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,360
who feels like

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,720
they have any sense of control over

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,760
their time

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,120
um but there's a it's it's a

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,039
like letting people do the things that

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,039
they wanted to do and are good at

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,159
but you need teams with like a number of

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,159
different skill sets

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:59,840
yeah uh

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:04,000
there we go you can hear me now

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:07,360
so as a scrum master part of my

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,640
job description is to help my team

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:14,640
identify and remove impediments

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,640
and part of any um

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,679
agile transformation for a team is the

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,880
process of getting

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,960
everything wrong about agile and that's

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,880
one of the places where that that

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,520
is a huge opportunity for

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,320
a team to believe that this person who's

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,120
coming

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,000
into their team that you know they know

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,520
what a product owner

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,039
is they know what a manager is they know

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,240
what a developer is they know what a

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,080
tester is but they don't know what a

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,200
scrum master is and here's this

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,120
oh they're gonna remove impediments

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,559
but that's not what a scrum master is

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,000
supposed to do the scrum master is

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,679
supposed to help the team

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,159
uncover the impediments and then help

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,600
them

00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:00,640
learn how to overcome them

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,360
but if you're not careful and i found

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,279
myself in

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,519
in this situation can immediately become

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,559
the team secretary

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,440
and if that becomes the understanding

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,159
if that becomes the baseline that the

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,440
team and management expects

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,200
then your performance reviews and the

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,080
way the team sees you

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,919
will from that point on be shaded by

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,720
whether or not you're willing to go in

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,120
and you know fill in all the paperwork

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,640
and

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,840
make all the phone calls and schedule

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,279
all the meetings and basically become

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,600
the secretary

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,840
uh and that's that's really not what the

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,840
whole hope is i hope is that

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,200
you know through good facilitation and

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,399
coaching uh

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,399
and mentorship and training the team

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,440
will be able to and

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,279
and i heard you talk about a little bit

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,679
earlier you know plan your backup know

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,399
who your

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,360
placement is have somebody with the same

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,519
skill set

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,039
and we talk about t-shaped people right

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,039
you know we want generalists that

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,799
specialize in something

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,720
um but the team itself

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,480
has a responsibility they have a

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,000
commitment to make they have

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,519
a role to play in solving those kinds of

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,960
problems

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,919
and even if the best scrum master in the

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,960
world

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,320
uh is willing to take on some of that

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,720
uh busy work wouldn't go busy work um

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,480
it's not helping the team unless the

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,640
team can eventually learn to solve that

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,080
stuff on their own and so i think that's

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,440
a

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,600
it's a huge hurdle but it's also um

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,600
one of the beautiful things about you

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,320
know really having an agile mindset and

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,039
and uh understanding how to implement

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,480
some of these

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,480
principles and values

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,039
awesome yeah thank you there was

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,720
uh i don't mean to kind of move us

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,080
forward but there was this awesome

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,960
question that kind of got lost

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,919
in the chat a little bit ago um kind of

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,559
discussing

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,960
uh recognizing others in the community

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,120
what tactics what strategies do you use

00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,159
and i think that this is a beautiful

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,679
question

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,399
especially when it comes to the burnout

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,799
discussion and moving people forward

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,880
um so i am also going to go ahead and

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,320
copy it into the metrics discussion

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,720
but i thought it would be worth bringing

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,720
up here

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,559
yeah that's fantastic i don't know folks

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,039
want to share strategies they have for

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,960
making sure that everyone feels included

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,399
and valued and

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,880
um you know like they're recognized and

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,880
important

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,519
i i've got something i'd like to share

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,440
here which is

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,640
and i just i i do this a lot when i'm

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,320
working with um

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,080
with my clients and we're starting new

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,440
communities

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,720
i call it um submarine incentives

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,120
so what you do is you figure out what is

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,440
like

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,480
um what is the behavior that you want to

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,240
see

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,840
in your community and then you figure

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,679
out okay what is

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,519
what is the first element of that

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,519
behavior that someone can demonstrate so

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,679
for example in open source it could be

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,359
that they submit a pull request or it

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,760
could be that someone organizes

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,760
or facilitates a zoom session or creates

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,639
their first piece of documentation

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,919
and ideally that you ideally that you

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,079
set some kind of tripwire

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,119
in your tooling to detect when that

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,240
happens

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,679
and then what happens is when they step

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,520
onto that tripwire and they do that

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,679
first thing

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,200
and they accomplish it especially is

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,440
that you literally reach out to them

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,119
with a personal message and just say

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,800
that was incredible so to give you an

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,639
example something i do all the time i'm

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,399
a big fan of discourse which is a forum

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,679
platform that many of you will know

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,679
and there's trust levels built into

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,119
discourse and when

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,879
you sign up for discourse you're at

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,079
trust level zero nobody knows who you

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,520
are it's like someone knocking on your

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,960
door at 11 o'clock at night you don't

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,399
know whether they're an axe murderer or

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,320
that they're your neighbor

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,679
um so you don't trust them and then what

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,359
happens is they're going to trust level

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,119
one once they've read a little bit

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,880
that participated and then they got to

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,480
trust level 2 and so on and so forth and

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,000
i like when people get into trust level

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,520
2 which is a pretty reasonable level of

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,200
participation

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,640
is that you then just post a topic to

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,440
the forum and just say

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,520
i just want to highlight blah for their

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,720
amazing participation now community and

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,880
doing great work and what it does is it

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,240
gives them the social standing gives

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,400
them social kudos because you're

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,920
recognizing them makes them feel good

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,680
and it's completely unexpected because

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,760
you're not saying to them

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,920
it's not like stack overflow where you

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,400
know if you have your question favorited

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,640
by 50 people then you get a badge

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,720
it's just a random act of kindness but i

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,880
think as a community manager

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,240
this the computer detects it for you but

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,800
the the the

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,839
recognition the validation is delivered

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,440
personally

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,200
and i just it doesn't cost anything and

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,160
i just think it people love that because

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,839
they love

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,280
i remember when i joined started with

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,000
open source and i started joining some

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,599
communities

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,280
and just when someone who i respected

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,839
talked to me i felt good

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,200
let alone them saying you know great job

00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,359
whatever

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,040
i think the public aspect of that is

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,359
also particularly

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,560
key like it's nice to say thank you

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,000
privately

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,720
um but it's it's nice to say it publicly

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,240
and in a way that doesn't feel automatic

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,359
like thanks for doing the thing

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,240
you know like but sounds really specific

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,320
like

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,760
thank you for taking care of that or

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,040
thank you for stepping up

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,320
and doing this thing um you know you did

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,760
an amazing job and

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,040
it's like so public and specific not

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,440
automated i think is the key there

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,960
i should say that dead because i

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,280
remember working with one company and

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
they

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,640
i recommended this to them and they did

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,200
it but they did it

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,960
in a very cut and pasty kind of way and

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,560
to your point that it came across as

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,160
just inauthentic

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,839
yeah you got to say something about the

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,520
individual why do you

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,000
appreciate their work because that makes

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,880
all the difference yeah and yeah also

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,440
i'd encourage

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,119
everyone to remember to recognize um

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,560
those things that you can't measure

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,160
you can't automate and measure and

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,560
someone made a point earlier in the chat

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,359
about recognizing the non-coding

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,640
the non-um maybe non-technical however

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,320
you want to say it there's so many

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,440
people who contribute to communities

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,599
that aren't going to show up in the um

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,200
you know the forum the the discourse

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,680
whatever the tool is that you just

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
mentioned

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,000
because it's harder to track so make

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,359
sure to recognize those folks too

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,119
yeah totally yeah non-coding member

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,720
agree totally

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,480
that i did do a whole video about

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,560
actually but um

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,520
super important and speaking of watch

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,000
because you know one of the great

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,599
benefits

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,599
of being online here of course is that

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,200
we can easily share links to resources

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,240
to books to videos

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,079
so um you know i'd love

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,520
if as we go through the day that you can

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,119
pop them into the document for each of

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,000
these different sessions but

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,640
um if you want to pop them into the chat

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,680
as well

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,359
that's all good so because sometimes

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,040
i've been to cls and people will

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,720
recommend books i'll go home and buy all

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,240
these books and it's like wow i've

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,640
never heard of these books it's amazing

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,280
so share you know pop them in if you if

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,680
you've got something you want to

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,680
recommend

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,160
so i think we've got about five minutes

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,720
left yeah

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,480
um whoa and then someone dropped it

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,280
emotional labor is still labor

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,640
and that's absolutely true and yeah if

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,320
you want to talk a little bit about that

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,079
and then while everyone else thinks

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,680
about like some of the key

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,000
insights that we want to put into the

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,000
document to share at the end of the day

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,760
uh sure um don't really have a whole lot

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,720
to say i rather like it as a bond mott

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,079
just um it goes back to recognizing a

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,599
lot of what we've been talking about

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,880
where even if somebody's doing something

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,720
and they're so reliable and they've

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,000
always been doing it

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,079
it might have once been a passion but

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,720
now it might be a chore and to make

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,920
people feel

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,359
seen and recognized um goes a really

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,359
long way to making

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,640
making things like emotional labor

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,960
community building

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,640
a lot of the glue become more

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,640
sustainable in my my experience

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,280
that's great um

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,400
all right so for key insights that we

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,880
might share in the wrap

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,240
up uh i don't know if folks want to pull

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,160
out some of the kind of

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,839
like maybe especially if there's

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,320
something you heard today that you were

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,880
like

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,839
oh i never thought of that that would be

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,359
an excellent

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,880
thing and then

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,320
we'll have all the resources in the

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,320
document for folks that want to dig

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,320
deeper

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,760
oh andy i guess you're stuck on

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,079
spotlight

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,079
i don't know how where's adorato

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,320
sorry really are people not seeing the

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,520
gallery view right now

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,119
i don't see it

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,720
i believe it might just be yours i

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,800
believe it has a default view

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,760
and then users can actually switch it on

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,320
their own

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,839
if that did happen inadvertently uh

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,880
hover your mouse over the top

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,960
right hand corner and you should see a

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,720
box to go full screen and then just to

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,800
the left of it either speaker view or

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,560
gallery view that'll allow you to switch

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,160
i don't think we have that level of

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,000
power we just

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,240
see the gallery view right now like i

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,280
can't switch the view uh-uh

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,760
like maybe it's because you're a

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,720
panelist um yeah i don't have the

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,240
gallery either

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:28,000
it looks like our i can see both of them

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:32,480
wow i'm currently a panelist though

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,160
yeah as a as an attendee we can't see it

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,920
but i can see the gallery view right now

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,160
and the chat uh i see

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,760
i see it looks like our viewers are

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,280
seeing the gallery which is good

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,640
this is what i meant earlier on folks

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,760
when i said we're building the car while

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,760
we're driving it we're figuring

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:54,000
i added a resource into the chat

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,440
um for team transformation canvas

00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,960
and a link um if anybody has

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,119
um awareness of the core protocols

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,760
that were developed by jim mccarthy and

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,079
melissa mccarthy

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,160
and their book software for your head is

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,520
based on this concept it's an early

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,520
take on um

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,400
the work that google did on on team

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,079
emotional intelligence

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,599
and basically the idea is there are

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,560
certain behaviors that

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,920
every high-performing team demonstrates

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,079
uh and this canvas

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,440
actually you can do it together as a

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,960
group or you can do it individually it

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,920
takes you through

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,520
um not necessarily the practices of the

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,920
protocols themselves

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,359
but the but the foundations of them you

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,079
know are are you safe

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,359
do you feel comfortable do you have an

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,480
aspiration

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,720
um are you how do you feel today

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,560
that that kind of information um i'm

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,280
still struggling to

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,000
uh help my team start down that pathway

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,280
of building

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,520
ei and psychological safety um

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,520
but i think if you start early uh are

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,200
you you make that a regular part of the

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,800
team conversation

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,560
and this is a tool that that i think

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,079
would help

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,800
i i think that would go a long way to

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,160
helping the team

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,960
especially feel comfortable with new

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:20,319
work and challenges

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,760
great um

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,640
just see the there's lots of great note

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,920
taking going on

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,560
so thank you to all of you um

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,720
thank you to the uh hang on the we have

00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:36,880
an anonymous badger anonymous crow

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:40,400
known as coyote and of course

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,560
the anonymous bat

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,520
okay lots of anonymous animals taking

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,690
amazing notes

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,079
so what are the menagerie yeah

00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:52,240
[Music]

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,240
any final thoughts before we wrap up

00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,880
um i i got a couple of things on the

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,920
take uh

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,800
let's see oh yeah the menagerie um so we

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,400
all had tools

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,079
i think what we ended up with for our

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,240
takeaways is that leaders need to stay

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,560
in the background and promote others

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,240
um build orgs that aren't automatically

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,720
headed for burnout and start by checking

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,160
that you

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,560
personally are not headed for burnout

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,839
and plan by for succession by keeping

00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:26,480
good docks and um uh having

00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:29,680
i guess redundancy or seconds

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,319
yeah right

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,160
so uh so that's what we have for tico is

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,400
anything else says someone was like oh i

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,440
thought you were certainly going to say

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,280
next we could put that in nope just say

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,040
thank you so much for the incredible

00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,760
engagement on this google doc

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,960
it is absolutely wonderful yeah this is

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,440
awesome

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,520
oh yeah actually thanks for uh modeling

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,280
the other thing which was to like
