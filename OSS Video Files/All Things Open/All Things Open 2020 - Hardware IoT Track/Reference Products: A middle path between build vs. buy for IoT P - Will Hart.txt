Abstract: Particle is an open IoT platform and service provider that has helped dozens of enterprises build and execute on their IoT strategy. Nearly every company we work with considers the same choice – “should we buy something off the shelf to try and solve this problem, or build a solution ourselves?” While the right answer is different for each organization, both paths have their challenges; plug-and-play solutions are largely inflexible and building from scratch is risky, expensive, and time-consuming.

Particle is pioneering a new path for the IoT market that combines the flexibility of building with the speed and convenience of buying – a new entry point for highly differentiated IoT solutions that we call “reference products.” In this talk, you’ll learn about our design philosophy behind reference products, and how you can design qualities like “openness” and “extensibility” into off-the-shelf solutions.

	00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,799
yeah so

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,800
the title of this talk is called

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,960
reference products a middle path

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,559
between build versus buy for iot so

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,519
we'll get into a little bit of what we

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,679
mean by that

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,119
um in general i think if you have

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,600
questions please feel free to submit

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,520
them

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,720
um as it says at the bottom of the slide

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,680
using the q a button

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,960
um i will generally i'll plan to leave

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,560
some time at the end to answer those

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,039
questions so as you have them feel free

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,800
to

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,400
drop them into chat and we'll circle

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,119
back at the end and get to as many of

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,120
them as we can

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,960
so again thanks for thanks for attending

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,239
and hopefully hopefully this helps

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,000
uh hopefully you find this talk

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,840
interesting

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
um so just as a means of a brief

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,879
introduction my name is will

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
i'm the senior director of product at

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,440
particle um we'll talk a little bit

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,559
about

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,039
particle uh uh what we are and and

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,719
and how we support um companies in

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,600
building connected products

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,360
um i have a a background originally in

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,280
mechanical engineering

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,399
and through my atomic particle have have

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,079
also

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,400
gained some experience with overseas

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,040
supply chain manufacturing open source

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,640
hardware design embedded systems

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,560
and and most recently have stepped into

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,640
a role leading product management here

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
at particle so excited to share some of

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,159
the learnings that we've uh and that

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,280
i've collected along the way and to talk

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,040
with you a little bit about

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,560
some of the the new concepts that we're

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,320
exploring in the world of open

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,880
uh in in the world of open source and

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,880
open hardware

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,640
so i think i want to set the stage here

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,360
by talking about

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,560
the um some of the the best impacts that

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,720
open source can have

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,000
right i think from our perspective as a

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,400
company that has invested

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,360
in in open source and open hardware i

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,680
think we believe that

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,560
open source is really about empowerment

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,759
it's about

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,560
uh and specifically by providing equal

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,640
access

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,320
so providing equal access to powerful

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
technologies and innovations that move

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,799
industries forward

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,280
as well as providing control empowerment

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,119
through control so essentially providing

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,799
providing individuals who are leveraging

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,680
open technologies

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,680
with the ability to you know to to see

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,399
into the black box to engage

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,239
with that source material and to

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,200
customize it and tune it

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,840
to meet the needs and requirements of

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,000
the

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,720
problem that they're trying to solve and

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,480
so just to take a step back particle is

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,599
a

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
a iot company that helps other

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,840
organizations

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,959
build solutions um that are based off of

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,160
our integrated iot platform we'll talk

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,760
about the connection there to

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,680
to uh uh open source in a second but

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,519
you know at a high level what we do is

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
we take a lot of open standards

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,200
protocols technologies

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,360
and have stitched them together into an

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,599
integrated platform a foundation

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
that other companies can build on top of

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,640
in order to

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,640
solve problems with connected solutions

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,680
so this is a small example

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,680
of a customer of ours who's building

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
an hvac or air conditioning monitoring

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,159
system which you can see on the bottom

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
left

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,360
to produce insights about that air

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,680
conditioner that allow them to

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,120
service that machine before it breaks

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,440
and so if you think about okay how is

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,319
particle helping this kind of a customer

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,159
to build a to build this solution we're

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,360
providing them with three basic things

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,840
compute connectivity and cloud services

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,080
that again are built on top of open

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,680
standards and in many cases are provided

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,239
through directly with open source

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,000
technologies and are integrated together

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,720
to provide a foundation that solves

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,640
a lot of the common problems that iot

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,360
that companies who are pursuing iot

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,640
initiatives are likely to run into

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,560
through the product development process

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,560
so specifically you know what what parts

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,360
of that platform are open source and how

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,319
do we provide

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,000
or how do we leverage uh um those open

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,120
source technologies to create benefits

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,439
for our customers

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,400
so across different layers of the stack

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,080
we're providing

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
direct access and control into the

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
platform through open technologies

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,599
so in the hardware side that that's in

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
the form of open source development kits

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,200
so if you go on our website and you buy

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,200
one of our flagship connectivity

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,680
products or development kits you can

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,480
you can look at the uh and modify the

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
open source

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,440
uh hardware designs um we also provide

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
open reference designs for that hardware

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,160
that gives a blueprint for how customers

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,720
can

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,919
integrate uh those those modules into

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,800
hardware

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,320
into uh designs of their own we provide

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,280
open source firmware

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,680
most notably device os is a is is really

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,400
the

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,080
the operating system that ties a lot of

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,560
these layers together

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,240
and is open source we also provide open

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840
application notes and open source

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,240
firmware libraries that help

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,759
our customers integrate custom sensors

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,160
with our hardware

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,320
um to build the kind of uh you know

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,120
environmental monitoring and and

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
and control use cases um that they that

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,560
they uh

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,199
uh develop on top of our platform we

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
provide

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,479
development tools many of which are open

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,600
source including our mobile apps

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,400
um our our uh professional uh

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,199
ide which is a extension of visual

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,120
studio code

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,639
as well as our command line tool and

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,080
finally we also provide open source

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,360
software um

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,800
namely in the form of sdks as well as a

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,720
server protocol

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,960
that customers can run at home to to

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,320
you know to deploy a local instance of

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,199
our our messaging

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,320
uh uh protocol uh on something like a

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
raspberry pi

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,240
so again by investing in all of these

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,479
and providing

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,080
a platform that is built on an open

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,479
standards but also delivered through

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,479
these

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,680
these open source technologies that

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,360
we've developed

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,120
we've seen a ton of benefits to our

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,600
customers as a result of this

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,360
increased trust because they know that

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,479
uh you know if particle were to simply

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,320
disappear one day

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,840
they would have a lot of the key tech

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,240
information that they need

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,440
to continue to develop and iterate on

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
the solution that they built with

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,840
particle

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,840
ease of use um because again we're

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,319
providing ways for customers to

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,160
to understand how key features and

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,240
functionality are implemented

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,199
in providing them with context to know

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,160
how to

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,639
to use those capabilities to create

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,960
greater amounts of flexibility and

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,360
differentiation

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,000
within their products so we have

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,319
customers

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
that that deploy our our technologies

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,199
off the shelf

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,240
just as they are we also have customers

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,919
that deeply

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,520
customize um or or change these

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,759
you know the source of our key

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,199
technologies to tailor them to the

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,199
specific needs of their use case

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,960
so if you think about the starting point

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,720
for most iot initiatives

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,560
um as as a as a you know challenging

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,080
product development process that

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,319
combines and integrates

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,680
layers of the technology stack from

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,280
hardware all the way up to cloud

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,240
generally we see customers following two

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,960
different routes

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,160
the first is diy or build it yourself

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
and on the other side of the spectrum

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,199
you have

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,000
buying an off-the-shelf solution right

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,560
and so if you think about the

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,479
differences between these approaches

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
um from from an openness perspective

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,360
obviously you're going to find a lot

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,400
more open standards and

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,520
and products available for the

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,280
build it yourself or diy route the this

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,400
openness allows for in our opinion

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,080
greater expressiveness and

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,800
differentiation you're able to

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,960
to leverage technologies that best need

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,560
meet the needs of your use case

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,000
and you have greater control over those

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,440
technologies and so you can

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,240
produce a end experience that is closer

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,800
to

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,240
um you know the the ideal uh you know

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,919
the ideal solution or the ideal

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,440
experience you're trying to provide

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,199
the challenges are there's higher risk

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,000
of failure because you need a lot of

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,919
deep expertise

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,520
in order to not only understand how to

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,280
leverage those open technologies

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,960
but in order to stitch them together in

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,520
the right ways to deliver

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,400
a connected experience that really spans

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,759
all of these layers of the tech stack

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,120
if you look at the off-the-shelf route

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,960
on the other hand these are built

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,000
generally with closed and proprietary

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
technologies and

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,120
while they may facilitate really rapid

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,080
deployment

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,720
they don't have a lot of the benefits of

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,199
of the

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,120
the you know of open technologies they

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,479
provide limited ownership and control

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
and frankly there aren't always

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,199
off-the-shelf solutions available for

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,360
every kind of

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,800
problem that we see our customers trying

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,039
to solve with with

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,400
iot and so again even though these open

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,520
standards exist

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,479
we see that most organizations aren't

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,919
equipped to be

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,839
successful with the diy route in iot

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,240
and i think that's broadly true but i

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,240
think it's especially true for iot and

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,479
and the reason for that is that iot as i

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,880
mentioned before really requires

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,959
a breadth of integration um and a

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,519
breadth of technology and orchestration

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,839
that

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,600
is greater than than than uh you know

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,640
almost any other product out there

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,000
um you can see that from the hardware

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
and device side all the way through to

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,920
the cloud side

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,640
in order to successfully deliver on even

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,959
basic

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,399
uh i connected experiences like an

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,080
over-the-air firmware update

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,240
you really have to consider a whole and

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,519
be an expert in a whole set

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,279
of different uh um

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,720
you know of different sub areas and sub

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,279
technologies

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,120
and domains that uh you have to then

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,880
bring together to be successful in

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,760
delivering on even a basic connected

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,680
product

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,440
and so again even though our there are

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,160
open standards that exist

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,120
to to support uh companies who are

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,200
developing

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,600
across almost all of these areas i think

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,959
what we see is that

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,519
most iot initiatives fail on the diy

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,040
route

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,760
um this is uh this is a a

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,360
report that was produced by cisco um and

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,920
and there are other reports that you

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,720
know between 75 and 80 percent that are

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,320
consistent

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
and a lot of the reasons for that are

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,480
because of long completion times

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,000
poor quality of data lack of expertise

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,839
and integration challenges

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,839
that essentially mean that companies

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,760
weren't successful in being able to

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,959
build a solution based off of the tools

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,040
that were available on market

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,640
even though again there are open

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,480
standards available

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,839
for a lot of the key components that you

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,680
need

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,519
in isolation and so i think that's where

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
a platform like particle has attempted

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,839
to take all of the great

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,279
and all the benefits and principles of

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,920
openness

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,320
and provide a easier path to market for

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,640
the

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,839
for companies that aren't in a position

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,399
to build

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,320
their own solutions from scratch and so

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,839
an integrated platform like particles

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,839
we have a mix of open source and

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,760
proprietary solutions right i think

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,920
as i we touched on earlier we try to

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,360
provide openness wherever possible

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,040
because we really believe that it's in

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,040
the best interest of our customers

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,399
and helps them succeed which helps us

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
succeed

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,000
so some of the benefits of that are we

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,600
can provide a quicker time to market

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,440
with a much lower maintenance burden

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
integration maintenance burden

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
but of course there are some constraints

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,240
that make it unsuitable for for certain

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,160
applications

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,000
and so again i think this is the

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,120
approach that particle has tried to take

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
since our

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,279
since we were we were created in 2013 is

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,279
this mix of

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,320
taking open technologies but packaging

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,800
them in a way

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,399
that allow organizations to leverage and

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,000
apply them more successfully

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,000
while still maintaining all of the

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,160
degrees of control

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,640
that that come with uh with open

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,480
technologies

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,560
and i think we've seen success with that

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,959
approach right so this open approach has

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,760
helped

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,399
make iot more accessible to

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,040
non-technologists and i think

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,600
when i say non-technologists i mean you

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,839
know

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
uh scientists so we work with a lot of

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,040
organizations where

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,880
um you know that require an incredible

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,760
amount of very specific scientific

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,360
knowledge

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,200
whether it's in you know micro

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,360
measurements of plants so that you can

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
compare how different soil and oxygen

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,440
conditions

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,079
lead to improved or or worse plant

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,120
growth

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,880
to detecting methane emissions we've

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,480
worked with startups again that are

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,240
that have very limited resources and

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
expertise and are focused on creating

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,920
value

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,360
in very specific areas um and and also

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,959
we've worked with for good company

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,920
organizations who are really who are

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,519
experts in

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,040
the kinds of social problems that

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,440
they're orienting to solve

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,200
um and and not necessarily experts in

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,600
iot tech and we've been

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
uh with our platform able to help these

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,200
kinds of

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,480
organizations succeed in building

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,639
connected solutions

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,839
to the problems that they're the most

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,120
important problems that they're trying

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,800
to solve

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,440
whether again it's optimizing plant

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,399
growth or reducing the toxic fumes in

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,120
in cook stoves or or helping to prevent

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,839
flooding

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,839
uh as a result of climate change

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,000
however open source

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,760
and openness alone does not guarantee

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,959
accessibility and i think even with this

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,160
integrated approach

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,160
there are constraints and

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
examples of that professional

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,800
implementation services can routinely

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,480
exceed

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,240
two hundred thousand dollars so building

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,639
hardware is expensive and even if we

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,240
provide an open source hardware design

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,399
that doesn't necessarily mean that our

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,320
customers will have the skills and

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,839
expertise to know how to

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,440
implement those designs in the most

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,560
effective way possible in a way that

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,320
achieves their goals

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,399
and so we provide professional services

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,720
to to support them with that

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,760
but again those services can can be

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,519
expensive

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,200
and many organizations especially

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,320
smaller ones aren't in a position to be

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,720
able to apply

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,680
those kinds of resources even just to

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,000
implement open technologies

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,760
secondly a lack of expertise limits

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,160
engagement with open components

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,680
so i mentioned device os it's it's it's

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,800
one of the most valuable parts of our

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,839
entire platform

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,160
and it's entirely open source um you

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,800
know

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,399
it's also it's also very complicated it

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,199
also provides a it

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,680
has an incredible amount of depth um a a

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,760
you know

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,800
growing and increasingly complicated

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,600
architecture

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,199
and so even individuals who have these

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,240
skills and expertise

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,399
to you know who have embedded skills

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,040
you know it it doesn't necessarily mean

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,240
that those skills can translate into

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,360
into a inability to deeply uh uh you

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,320
know engage with

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,160
a source of repository that has you know

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,560
that has hundreds of thousands of line

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,320
of lines of code in it

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,320
um and finally even with help

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,199
implementation mistakes cost timing

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,279
money and so

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,320
even with the abstractions that we built

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,839
into our platform

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,920
we still see uh customers who make

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,360
you know rookie errors who who design

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,720
themselves into boxes

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,079
and prevent themselves from achieving

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,440
their goals because they didn't have the

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,480
expertise required

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,240
to build on top of the platform even at

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
the the starting point that we provided

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,560
to them

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,000
and so i think what we've started to

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,519
reflect on as an organization

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,839
is that you know coming back to this

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,279
idea of empowerment

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,959
if you really want to empower

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,760
organizations you have to make open

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,480
technologies

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,440
accessible um and so what we've started

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,199
to think about

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,519
is the consumption model for open

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,399
technology how do customers

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,160
and and organizations leverage open

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,720
technology in order to achieve their

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,399
goals

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,480
i think what we believe is that the

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,880
consumption model for open technology

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,519
must also be flexible enough to scale

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,560
with users level of expertise

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,760
and what i mean by that is is in a lot

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,320
of cases we found

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,800
that simply providing the blueprints the

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,440
open source technology is not sufficient

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,279
to actually support organizations in

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,480
achieving their goals

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:37,040
and so as a result we've started to

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,199
invest in a new kind of a new delivery

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,240
vehicle a new a new kind of packaging

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,759
for open source

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,600
and open technologies which we're

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,880
calling reference products

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,639
so i want to talk a little bit about

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,480
what a reference product is

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,480
and how we're trying to use reference

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,399
products to scale

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
the interface for consuming our open

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,160
platform to meet the

00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,240
levels of expertise of our customers so

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,600
our first reference product is what we

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,920
call the tracking system

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,000
so you know to take a step back we have

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,600
a lot of customers even before we launch

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,079
this reference product who are already

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,079
building

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,680
tracking asset tracking solutions on top

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,959
of the particle platform

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,040
and they're building those solutions

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,720
because they wanted you know they had

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,240
highly they wanted to create highly

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,399
differentiated

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,079
products uh they wanted to integrate

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,839
tracking into existing

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,079
product services or vehicles or they

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,759
wanted to to you know build

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,360
um tracking solutions that help them

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,399
increase the operational efficiency of

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,160
their business

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,680
so on the left left you can see the

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,800
tracker some it's

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,480
it's a um it's a hardware component a

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,240
lot like our other hardware components

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,360
it allows someone that provides all the

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,839
critical iot

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,399
embedded systems necessary that you can

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,360
build

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,959
an iot product around um and so this

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
represents a more traditional approach

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,240
for particle right it's

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,240
it's to say hey we're giving you an

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,240
advanced starting point by taking this

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,639
complicated tracking system

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,680
and giving you all the hardware guts

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,440
that you need

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,839
to get started a microcontroller

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,000
cellular connectivity gps

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,959
some some motion detection right and

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,480
we're packaging that

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,360
and providing it to you so you can build

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,360
a product around it

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,880
but like we said what we found is that

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,839
that

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,160
approach isn't as always as accessible

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,679
as

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,319
as as customers need it to be and so for

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,839
that we

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,000
produced our first reference product

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,120
tracker one which essentially takes that

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,200
technology

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,520
and embeds it within an open reference

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,799
design with that's a finished enclosure

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,240
that's fully certified and is built um

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,120
with to be to to to be able to be

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,880
deployed

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,480
by organizations who don't have the same

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,480
depth of expertise

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,480
but still provide those organizations

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,120
with the same degrees of flexibility the

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,240
same amount of

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,880
openness the same amount of control and

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,840
expressiveness that we bake into our

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,799
platform

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,039
broadly finally we've paired both of

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,400
those pieces of hardware with a new

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,000
kind of a new a new set of software

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,799
capabilities that we're calling tracking

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,600
services

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,840
which again are aimed at pro at solving

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,679
a

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,919
subset of the problems that our

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,960
customers need help

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,200
solving things like being able to to

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,440
store geo location data securely

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,880
being able to visualize location on a

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,280
map being able to provide

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,120
basic device management but has been

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,200
designed in a way such that

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,880
while it can work off the shelf we've

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,960
created these axes

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,919
that allow more advanced customers to

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,919
engage at

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,679
different levels of depth with this

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,600
software in an open way

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,400
so that the the amount of customization

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,600
can map to the the individual customers

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,559
level of expertise

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
and ability to express um the the

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,520
differentiation that they

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,520
that they're trying to build into their

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,120
products so we'll talk a lot more about

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,440
what that actually looks like here

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,039
in just a second um

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,720
when we talk about providing different

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,360
consumption models with reference

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,960
products

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,039
this is an illustration so you can see

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,440
at the bottom the two gray boxes

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,799
these are two this is the basic way that

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,960
our our platform

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,400
has worked for the last eight years

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,480
essentially we're built on an open

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,760
source foundation that allows for very

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,360
deep customization by

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,679
experts who know how to leverage that

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,640
technology we're then providing platform

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,200
abstraction

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,160
that allows for for a simplified

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,520
development process

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,919
and assisted development so we're

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,400
providing hardware blocks sdks

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,600
basic apis and out of box capabilities

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,520
like ota

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,440
that allow customers to get critical

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,799
functionality without having to build it

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,480
themselves

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,880
with our reference products we're adding

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,919
two new layers on top of that open

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,640
foundation

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,080
that are meant to make it easier for

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,000
different organizations

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,679
to leverage that platform so

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,080
specifically we've introduced an idea of

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,960
configurable features this idea that we

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,440
can provide

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,679
a capability like how often do you want

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,760
the tracker to report its location

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,919
and then provide our customers with a

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,240
way without engaging in the source code

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,880
to be able to customize that behavior

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,000
through the software services um and

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,440
then finally

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,280
you know we with tracker one we've

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,720
really focused on providing smart

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,679
out-of-box defaults

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,320
that allow for the simplest form of uh

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:22,320
consumption which is plug and play

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,840
so again um with the tracking system

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,600
we're providing out of boxes

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,400
plug-and-play experience but providing

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,039
channels

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,840
that allow customers to dig down into

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,520
layers

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,720
of the of the solution to to

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,200
to customize those layers of openness

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,400
um where they have the abilities and

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,679
skills

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,200
to to um express uh

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,039
the the kind of differentiation that

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,799
they're looking to achieve so

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,320
let's this is all very hypothetical

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,280
right and so i want to use some specific

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,080
examples to

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,520
to um to drive home how we're thinking

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,640
about this new notion of reference

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,000
products

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,760
so let's look at hardware right so

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,320
at the hardware layer like i said a

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,520
beginner can simply deploy the product

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,480
off the shelf an intermediate user

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
um because the the uh the solution is

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,720
open source

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,280
um customers are able to you know to

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,720
to customize that reference design to do

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,400
things like change the shape of the

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,360
enclosure move systems around or

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,520
eliminate systems to make it smaller

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,640
and fabricate their own uh you know

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,480
their own designs

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
based off of that reference design where

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,640
we're still providing a lot of the

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,360
key systems but they're able to to

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,960
modify the design as needed to to more

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,080
specifically match the needs of their

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,159
use case

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,080
and then finally an advanced user could

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,840
simply buy that core hardware component

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
the som and integrate it into a fully

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,960
custom

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,400
vehicle like uh like a connected scooter

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,600
or a bike right

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,520
um so that they could if you do have

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,880
a you know a great amount of depth you

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,799
can engage all the way at the bottom

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,440
layer and

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,240
you know work closer to the foundation

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,000
to

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,360
to you know provide the degrees of

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,360
flexibility that you need

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,120
to build a very highly differentiated

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,440
solution right so same

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,799
really same basic product just being

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,720
engaged with at three different levels

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,840
similarly if we look at okay you might

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,520
want to add a sensor

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,880
to your tracking solution right how

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,400
would you do that

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,919
so again for beginners with that open

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,919
hardware design one of the things we're

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,080
doing is providing a reference for

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,960
how you can use track location movement

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,039
and temperature

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,960
with built-in sensors and so out of the

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,760
box our software allows you to

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,520
do things like monitor the temperature

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,200
for an application like cold chain

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,039
right where you're transporting goods

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,360
that need to be stored um so you want to

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,360
know

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,799
yeah where the device or where the where

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
the truck is but also you want to have

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,159
the confidence

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,760
of knowing the temperature of the food

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,600
truck you know the truck over time so

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,360
that you can demonstrate

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,880
for for auditing reasons or just for

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,960
safety reasons that

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,799
the you know the food or or the the

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,080
medicine or whatever it is the blood

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,520
samples are stored at the appropriate

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,520
location at the appropriate temperature

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,120
if you're an intermediate you're

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,760
probably looking to add your own sensors

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,440
right so

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,000
we've in the hardware design thought

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,960
about how can customers do that how can

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,799
customers

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,080
um you know how can we provide an open

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,120
interface to customers

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,400
that allows them to customize this this

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,520
out of box solution

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,440
and so we we've built a

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,880
expansion port that that's we call the

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,120
m8 port which is really just a

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,880
non-creative name for for the name of

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,120
that kind of a connector but it provides

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,400
a standard set of interfaces for power

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,480
like can

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,480
for for connecting additional sensors

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,039
and for powering the device or

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,080
other other devices that customers can

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,120
engage with

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,559
in a in a structured constrained an

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,240
abstracted way

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,840
that allows them to get some amount of

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,840
customization without having to go all

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,600
the way to the bottom layer

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,279
and finally again we're providing

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,960
unlimited sensor configuration if you

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,279
want to build your own thing

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
there there's you know tons of gpio

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,000
available for

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,039
you to build your own custom circuit

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,720
board based off of

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,640
the reference design and implement it

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,480
that way

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,080
last example i'll use is about device

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,960
management and configuration of these

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
devices right

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,400
so one of the things i mentioned is you

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,960
know we're providing ways for customers

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,760
to

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,559
change the behavior of their devices and

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,159
um

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,600
you know at the at the most simple level

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,200
what does that look like just

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,120
choosing from a list of smart defaults

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,120
right so if you're you're tracking

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,799
a logistics uh you know a package

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,840
delivery versus shared vehicles or

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,200
service vehicles

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,840
there might be a trade-off between

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,880
battery life and the the granularity of

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,919
location that

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,679
that you need in order to uh

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,679
you know in order to to solve the

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,600
problem that you're trying to solve

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,919
for intermediates that looks like okay

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,360
we're providing a way for you to dig

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,000
into those smart defaults

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,799
and customize individual components

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,840
around

00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,720
how often it reports when it reports

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,679
and and what feedback it's providing

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,520
physically

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,799
through through its physical interfaces

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,200
like the rgb led

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,640
so you can create and customize behavior

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,279
still without writing or

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,720
or publishing code to the device and

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,320
then finally of course if you're an

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,799
advanced user you can

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,600
create you know deep deeply customized

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,039
behavior

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,240
by engaging by tying the sensors with

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,320
custom firmware

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,360
uh and and using our configuration

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,600
services with

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,039
custom variables that you've introduced

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,840
in order to get the exact kind of

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,520
behavior

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,799
that you want so

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,559
what does this all mean right we're

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,159
providing these different axes these

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,240
different ways and depths

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,080
for people to engage with this product

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,840
which we think of again is really one

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,440
product but that has different

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,559
consumption interfaces

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,360
across different elements of the product

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,240
to meet the needs of our users right and

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,159
so

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,240
i use this as an example to say okay if

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,559
you're if you're creating a startup

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,000
uh or you know micro mobility startup or

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,159
you're tracking the location of an

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
ambulance um with within vehicle

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,000
displays for collision prevention

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
or you're a logistics provider right

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,799
maybe you're a software systems

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,960
integrator and you're creating

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,039
uh route optimization software that

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,679
works with pre-configured hardware

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,480
for deliveries these are all potential

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,520
customers

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,279
of this product again but they have very

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,480
different levels of expertise

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,120
and needs and so

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,520
by building on top of the open nature of

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,600
the

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,440
of the platform and by packaging that

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,919
openness into

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,559
a reference product what we've done is

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,039
given

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,880
different kinds of customers abilities

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,720
to engage at different levels of depth

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,400
across the technology stack

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,640
to help them be more successful in

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,039
deploying a product

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,960
that again gives them the the

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,960
flexibility that they want

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,840
to build a highly differentiated

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,799
solution

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,400
so you know this is very new for us

00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,679
we've just started experimenting with

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,720
this idea of open

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,720
open reference products as a way to

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,799
help make our open technologies more

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,240
accessible to a broader set of customers

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,559
but we've seen really encouraging

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,640
results so i mentioned we've had a lot

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,480
of asset tracker customers acid tracking

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,080
customers historically a particle

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,919
and what we're seeing is about one third

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,520
of new customers are choosing to deploy

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,159
with tracker one which again

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,039
is our ready to go totally finished off

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,000
the shelf

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,399
um sort of product which to us means

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,799
that

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,760
when given the choice they would rather

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,279
uh you know

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,000
deploy their expertise on on on issues

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,720
related to

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,520
software or customization of of uh

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,600
behavior

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,360
as applies to as opposed to engaging

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,039
deeply with the

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,960
uh you know with the hardware and the

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,200
embedded design process

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,640
and so you know part of the reasons

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,799
they're choosing to do so again are

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,480
decreased expertise required in hardware

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,840
it provides them with a faster time to

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,360
market because they don't have to become

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,679
experts in hardware or in

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,360
in supply chain and it also lowers the

00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,760
cost of customizations that they do want

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,520
to do

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,320
so we do have customers who are who are

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,919
interested in modifying our open design

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,520
and whether they're doing it themselves

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,720
or working with us to do it they're able

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,440
to do so a lot more

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,559
uh inexpensively right we're lowering

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,679
that threshold

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,880
and the cost of entry to building highly

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,760
customized tracking solutions

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,919
and even for customers who are still

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,880
engaging deeply with the sum right with

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,679
the with the

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,440
um with the sort of integrated solution

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,200
that you build a product around

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,799
we're also still seeing benefits from an

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,440
accessibility standpoint we're seeing

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,679
that

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,200
that customers are saving tens of

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,159
thousands of dollars on professional

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,399
services

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,520
that they're able to save money overall

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,600
because

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,880
we're able to provide what they need in

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,640
a more compact and cost

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,799
optimized package and they're also

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,640
getting to market faster

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,240
than than they would be otherwise

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,520
because we're saving even

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,960
even when working with professional

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,799
services because we're saving them

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
cycles in the design process

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,399
um and we're reducing the amount of deep

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,880
hardware customization work that's

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,880
required

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,039
so we if we come back to this model we

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,760
sort of think of these reference

00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,919
products as as an in between in between

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,600
between an integrated platform approach

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,480
and an off-the-shelf approach

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,279
where you know we're taking all of the

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,360
open

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,399
extensible frameworks that that are in

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,559
our platform

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,640
and packaging them in a way that allows

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,039
customer that reduces the barrier to

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,440
engaging with those technologies

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,600
it provides even faster time to market

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,039
with with still meaningful customization

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,120
that allows you to

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,640
to you know do quick configurations on

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,720
the fly that's all you need

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,559
but still provides you the full ability

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,039
to dive into the source code

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,960
um or even build your own versions of

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,640
the solutions off of our own hardware

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,080
and and firmware reference designs if

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,200
you need to

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,039
um and uh you know i think if there's a

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,480
con here it's it's that you know if

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,799
you're if you're buying or

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,720
utilizing a reference product then you

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,080
know some of the core functionality that

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
quality is going to be determined by the

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,440
vendor right so the question is do you

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,000
trust who you're buying this reference

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,559
product

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,080
from to solve and and provide

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,799
abstraction around some of the core

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,360
functionality like tracking gps location

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,480
right

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,159
um that that uh is a is is likely a

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,320
an important and core part of the

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,320
functionality of your product

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,880
but for a lot of customers we've seen

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,840
again success here and we've seen

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,919
a lot of a lot of positive engagement

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,640
with how we package the openness of our

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,679
platform

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,159
in these kinds of reference products

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,720
so you know if there's any summary i

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,320
think

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,399
what we're learning at particle through

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,520
our journey in open hardware is that

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,240
um thinking about how technologies are

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,159
consumed

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,840
um not just whether they're open or not

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,440
is really important and that providing

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,360
these kinds of flexible consumption

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,240
models can increase the reach and the

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,520
impact of open technology

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,679
i think we've seen that reference

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,919
products they provide opportunities to

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,159
create new kinds of consumption models

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,679
that can better scale to meet users

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,919
where they are

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,799
and finally you know we've personally

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,799
found that our first

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,640
reference product has increased the

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,480
accessibility of our platform

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,080
by reducing the cost and expertise

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,919
required to deliver

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,279
it specifically on these kinds of asset

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,559
tracking solutions

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,919
so um you know i hope that

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,399
that uh this concept of open products

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,000
you know prompts you to think about okay

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,799
the the ways that we can

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,519
better package open technologies to make

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,919
them

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,600
more accessible to the users that are

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,960
best suited to utilize them

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,320
so that they they increase the amount of

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,080
impact that they're able to create in

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,519
the real world

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,720
so uh you know just as a final note we

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,600
do have a booth here in the virtual

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,559
exhibit hall

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,799
um and we'll be providing uh special

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,440
discounts codes to folks who stopped by

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,320
um so so uh you know please please

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,760
consider doing so

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,760
if if you want to learn more about

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,279
particle or learn more about our

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,559
reference products and

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,240
finally i'd i'd uh uh you know with that

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,120
want to conclude the talk and invite

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,600
anybody to

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,120
who has questions to enter them below um

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,200
and we'll utilize the last

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,240
i think we have about you know 12

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,919
minutes or so

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,519
to answer questions that you all have

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,519
about particle about uh

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,200
open source uh the ways that we use open

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,880
source or about this new concept of

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,600
reference products that we're building

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,600
um out

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,720
thank you will so much that was a great

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,360
talk okay everybody if you can utilize

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,880
the chat window to put any questions in

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,880
that would be fantastic

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,279
so will how long have you been with

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,919
particle um i've been with particle for

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,399
um for about coming up on eight years

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,600
now

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,360
um we were originally founded in uh 20

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,080
late 2012

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,600
and i joined in early 2013 so i've had

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,880
the opportunity to see us grow and

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,880
change from a

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,440
you know originally a connected light

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,000
socket company called spark

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,240
this is sort of before philips hue and

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,519
products like lifx existed

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,240
now to a company really focused on

00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,000
on you know utilizing what we learned

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,600
from the process of building a connected

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,919
product to help other companies do the

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,919
same thing

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,799
nice that's really exciting where did

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,120
you work at before particle

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,240
uh before particle you know had uh had a

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,720
you know um

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,159
a series of of uh sort of you know

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,240
shorter term roles as i was trying to

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,679
figure out exactly where my my passion

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,519
laid i mentioned at a background in

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,279
mechanical engineering and so

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,519
um you know some of the earliest roles

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,640
that i had were in industrial design and

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,840
design engineering

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,799
um and so uh you know really thought i

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,120
had a

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,080
future and career in designing you know

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,360
sexy

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,159
you know sexy consumer products um and

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,440
uh

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,840
um but uh you know i think it's for the

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,799
best this is this has been a a fantastic

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,159
ride and

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,279
um and uh i think i found a lot more

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,000
success here than i would have had

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,919
sitting behind

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,399
a desk doing solid works all day anyway

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,760
so oh i'm sure that doesn't appeal to me

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,560
at all but i know

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,000
um a lot of people love that career path

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,520
and i think particles it sounds like a

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,639
really great fit for you

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,520
yeah tom thanks for your comment i'm

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,520
glad to see

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,760
that will has got your wheels turning

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,480
yeah um so yeah i see the first question

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,480
here which is

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,760
um you know i'll answer live which is

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,679
does particle offer the reference

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,560
implementations already manufactured

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,240
so yes and and really you know what i'm

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,079
when i mentioned uh let me see if i can

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,079
backtrack here

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,320
um you know when i mentioned uh tracker

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,119
one right as this this uh reference

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,440
product

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,280
um that's exactly right this reference

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,480
this reference implementation

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,000
is a is

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,599
available to buy off the shelf so we

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,919
have tons of customers who

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,040
take this open source design and simply

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,960
say

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,160
you know yep this meets my needs this

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,880
meets my requirements

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,320
so you know i'm happy to i'm happy to

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,880
buy this off the shelf

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,400
uh and deploy it as is it's open so i

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,560
know if i need to or want to in the

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,880
future i can customize it

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,560
but uh you know but if it meets the

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,839
needs of your use case

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,680
or you don't have the skills to

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,200
customize and yeah you're you're

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,760
more than able to simply just buy and

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,040
deploy off the shelf without needing to

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,119
uh without needing to go through the

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,480
process of becoming an expert in

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,760
manufacturing so the the second question

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,839
says it looks like you can only use

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,520
particle if you pay uh per month per

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,560
device so

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,920
um our so if you're using our our uh

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,000
you know our core cloud software

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,560
services um which is to say if you're

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,079
using

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,680
our our hosted offering then we're

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,920
providing these services

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,280
uh you know for a fee right this is sort

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,000
of the the uh

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,760
monetization model of particle as an iot

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,359
company right we provide that hosting

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,480
and that infrastructure management

00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,480
so that customers don't have to

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,800
manage it themselves as a service

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,320
however uh you know like i said

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,839
all of our hardware products are open

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,480
and so if you buy a piece of

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,000
particle hardware you can reprogram that

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,320
hardware down to the source

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,760
um and so if you want to pursue you know

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,680
to leverage our hardware

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,760
take our reference design change it

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,160
modify it um deploy it in a different

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,359
way

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,440
um there's nothing preventing you from

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,160
doing that so um like i said our

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,200
hardware

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,320
uh and device os has provided you know

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,079
open source as is and if uh you you know

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,839
most of our customers choose to work

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,359
with us because they don't want and pay

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,000
us because they don't want to deal

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,560
with the burden of managing these kinds

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,320
of uh

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,400
um you know software services on their

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,640
own but like i said if you're

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,839
if you're an individual who wants to

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,839
leverage that hardware in a different

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:55,440
way there's there's absolutely nothing

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:58,400
stopping you from doing so

00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:09,839
awesome thank you will anybody else out

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:09,839
there with a question

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,320
um i see i see a question that's just in

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,119
the the general chat

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,520
um it says what is the dev platform um

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,599
so

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:26,000
you know maybe i'll go back to the

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,200
to the one of the earlier slides that i

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,200
provided here right

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,520
so um we are

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,119
we provide customers with a set of

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,839
development tools

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,440
that make it easier to build with the

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,960
open components that we provided

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,960
so specifically our device os provides

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,640
firmware abstraction so you can run any

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,720
you know cec plus plus code on our

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,800
devices but what we provide with device

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,440
os is layers of abstraction that allow

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,400
you to

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,800
write you know in wiring or arduino if

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,280
that's

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,040
uh which are a lot of our customers are

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,560
more familiar with and to leverage that

00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,200
abstraction to create

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,040
simple applications without having to

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,400
engage with the low level

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,400
you know hardware peripherals for

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,680
example so

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,599
that's sort of the base of our

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,200
development model is device os and the

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,640
abstraction that's built in now again

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,000
device os is open source and so you can

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,359
sort of see what those abstractions look

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,720
like and engage at deeper levels if

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,200
you'd like

00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,960
on the development tools side we provide

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,800
a set of open source tools

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,720
a cloud compilation service that you can

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,640
utilize or you can download our tool

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,040
chain and compile locally

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,560
we provide our command line tool which

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,359
is open source and allows for you to

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,560
build you know

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,200
custom scripts that utilize um our cli

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,240
to

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,920
to you know manage your device flash the

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,240
device uh you know etc

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,079
locally um we also provide a visual

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,359
studio code extension which is

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,640
you know also open that allows you to

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,400
utilize the visual studio code in a way

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,400
that can tightly integrate

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,359
the open firmware libraries and device

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,119
os and development model that we built

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:06,240
now that being said um that being said

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,000
uh you know if you uh want you can also

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,200
leverage your own development tools

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,359
um and and you know utilize

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,200
you know our compilation service if you

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,640
want to utilize our ota flashing

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,640
services you want to you can

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,760
sort of utilize pieces that you want and

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,240
and um

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,440
use your own you know own development uh

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,440
um stack or

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:32,960
tool chain where um where you prefer

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,240
so uh last question there from mark is

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,480
i assume you have something like the

00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,119
arduino ide yes so we do provide like i

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,359
said

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,200
the visual studio code extension and the

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,960
command line tool as

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,200
uh as two development environments we

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,760
also provide a web-based ide

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,599
which is you know fully browser-based is

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,800
probably most comparable to a simplified

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,079
arduino ide

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,320
that you can that you can

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,599
leverage as well for for beginners and

00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,760
again that's cloud hosted so you don't

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,599
have to deal with all the issues of uh

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,599
you know tool chain management etc

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,880
and then finally is there a source you

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,599
recommend on getting started so there's

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,079
actually a

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,079
um you know we have a set of tutorials

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,680
on our website if you go to

00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:16,240
docs.particle.io that allow you to

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,839
um uh you know get started and learn

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,640
about the platform i also recommend you

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,040
know buying a

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,720
a development kit um you know you can

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,640
purchase them for as little as you know

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,319
nineteen dollars on our website and

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,240
that's also a great way to

00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,680
to you know follow those tutorials um

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,280
but uh if you're interested in pure

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,400
content yes we do have a youtube channel

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,119
that has a bunch of getting started

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,599
videos

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,400
we also have i think there's also a a

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,440
book that was

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,200
uh um published on getting started with

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,079
the with the photon which was one of our

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,760
previous uh

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,319
uh wi-fi products that also provides a

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,599
good way to if you want a real sort of

00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,200
long-form guided

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,000
get to know the platform provides a way

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,880
to better understand the capabilities

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,880
of article

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,319
and of course i'd be remiss in saying

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,920
you know if you have any other questions

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,000
as well there are folks

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,440
at the particle team who are who are

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,839
here to help whether that's in

00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,880
you know in in uh we we have a an

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,560
organization that can help you

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,040
understand how to leverage particle to

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,480
scale

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,760
if that's something you're interested in

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,359
um or if you have more technical

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,359
questions we also have a support

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,960
uh a support line that does you know

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,520
email q a and then really active

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,640
community format

00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,280
community.particle.io that can provide

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,520
you with

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,839
answers to questions um that community's

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,920
been active since you know 2013

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,760
and is is one of the largest and and

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,720
most helpful in the entire iot industry

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,200
so

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,119
a great resource if you want to ask or

00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,319
better understand

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,680
particle either you know from

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,440
you know just based off of the interest

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,880
you have or if you're

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,800
deep in the weeds of a technical

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,800
challenge and want guidance or tips

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,440
all right it looks like we probably have

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,680
time for about one more question if

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,880
anybody has one out there and

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,640
yeah i mean particle's a great

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,319
organization riot's so happy that

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,480
they're part of our ecosystem

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,480
we love having you guys come in and give

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,520
lunch and learns and talks at some of

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,880
our events so

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,880
everybody check them out if you haven't

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,560
already

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,000
yeah just last comment here uh oh it's

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,079
okay here we go how does particle test

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,040
its devices for long-term deployments uh

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,599
good question so

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,960
one of the things that we've been um one

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,079
of the major product initiatives that we

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,520
announced earlier this year that we're

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,560
almost ready to roll out is

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,680
is a is a

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,200
new sort of base for our device switch

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,520
device os which is an lts release branch

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,319
lts stands for you know long-term

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,560
support

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,319
it's a really common model for you know

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,800
uh you know companies like ubuntu right

00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,200
have

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,839
or node.js have have lts release

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,760
branches

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,440
that are intended to provide a a sort of

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,000
long-term unchanging

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,520
stable foundation for uh long-term

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,160
deployments and so

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,359
we've been rebuilding our you know

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,359
because

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,640
because uh the customers who deploy with

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,720
particle need those

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,040
devices to operate reliably in the field

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,760
for long periods of time

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,720
we've we've developed this lts branch as

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,040
a way to

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,040
create a unchanging foundation and and

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,560
to be able to pursue feature development

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,960
in a separate branch so with with

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,599
our lts branches we do a lot of deep

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,359
testing

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,640
um you know that leverages sort of a

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,079
variety of techniques

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,079
um that span from you know uh um

00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,920
you know just uh integrated testing in

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,720
the you know in the in the um source

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,079
itself

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,119
to um you know proactive qa to

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,920
to uh um you know customer uh

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,520
uh beta and and testing with uh you know

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,200
devices in our uh

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,760
you know our customers devices in our

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,079
labs um upgrade downgrade testing

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,319
over the year firmware testing um so i

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,119
think with with these new lts

00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,480
uh branch we've really increased the the

00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,160
volume of testing

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,520
that we provide um to to really

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,119
ensure that we're providing a stable

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,760
foundation for these applications that

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,800
need to

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:17,599
last in the field for for you know in

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:17,599
