Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Hardware/IoT Track

Abstract: Simulation has long been a powerful tool in the development of robots. Without the limitations of hardware, developers can iterate quicker and more safely on their algorithms. Simulation can also be used for continuous integration, machine learning and education. This talk will introduce the latest version of the Gazebo simulator, which is one of the most used simulators in robotics. The new version is based on modular libraries that can be reused in a wide variety of robotics applications. It supports highly customizable graphical interfaces, rendering and physics, and can be used on domains ranging from air, ground and underwater. All this together with first-class support for the Robot Operating System (ROS), which is the de facto standard framework for robot development today.

hi everyone

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
uh it's great to be here today uh to

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,559
talk about robot simulation

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,000
um i don't know what's everybody's

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,200
background here i

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,760
assume there are some people who are

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,199
familiar with robotics and simulation

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,520
and there are probably some people who

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,880
have never used the simulator before

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,720
um so before i jump into the this talk

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,720
and talk about all of the ways that you

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,960
can customize simulation

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,760
uh i wanted every one of you to think

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,800
about

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,680
what is you expect from a robot

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,680
simulation

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,719
like in your head and it doesn't matter

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,920
if you've

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,000
used simulation before or if you've uh

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
are just here like listening about it

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
for the first time

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,680
like think about what do you think is is

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,840
involved in a robot simulation what

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,079
features does it need

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,440
so while uh you're thinking about that

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,640
let me introduce myself

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,840
and the company i work for so

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,079
my name is luis pobel i'm the tech lead

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,119
of

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,119
ignition at open robotics at open

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,280
robotics we

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,400
developed open source software for

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,200
robotics

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,280
and that includes uh simulator but it

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
also includes ros the robot operating

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,560
system

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,119
which some of you may have heard of

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,320
which is

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,439
uh highly used in academia and

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,840
uh in industry to develop robots

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,799
and the simulator side we developed

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
gazebo

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,880
and recently i've been leading the the

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,920
ignition team which is

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,280
doing a refactoring of gazebo so you can

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,200
see here that we have

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,200
people all around the world we have a

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,600
lot of people in california

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,840
in the us there are people all over the

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
us as well

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,360
and then there we have some guys in

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,119
spain and we have

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,000
an office in singapore with a lot of

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,600
people there are people in tokyo

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,479
and of course we have like this global

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,560
open source community online that is

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,520
always contributing with our projects

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,159
and and helping us out and making the

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,759
product

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,879
even uh better every time so

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,760
um have you had time to think about what

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,560
robot simulation is and what you expect

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,599
from it

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,040
um i'm going to show now a definition of

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,920
simulation that i hope

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,160
fits all of the definitions that

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,840
everybody came up with in their heads

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,680
which i hope is generic enough to

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,160
include all of this and then we can talk

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,080
about

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,480
the different um the different

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
aspects that that people may have

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
thought about

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,599
so um like

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,519
simply speaking simulation is

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,959
a robot simulator is creating a

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,840
simulated reality for a virtual robot

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,840
so the it's kind of like the matrix the

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,560
robot thinks that it's in the real world

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,480
but it's not

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,560
really the real world it's not really

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,640
physical even the robot's body

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,680
itself the robot thinks it's real but

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,680
it's not

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,760
the whole point is to trick the robot to

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,040
make the robot think that it is

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,879
real and what's the point of that

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,239
right like why why are we tricking

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,599
robots uh

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,200
and robot algorithms and robot software

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,120
and like there are many use cases for

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,239
simulation for example

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,920
um like working on your algorithms

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,400
like working on the logic for your

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,640
robots if you have a simulated robot

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,239
uh it can be very convenient because you

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,120
don't need to go to a lab you can do it

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,200
from home

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,879
right like in these times when

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,480
everybody's working from home it's very

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,319
convenient to just have your robot

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,680
inside a computer for you

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,760
um and there is also like maybe

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,120
there is only one robot available to

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,080
your entire team

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
it's maybe a very expensive robot so the

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,400
company can get one robot for each

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
developer

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
but everybody has to make progress in

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,439
parallel so that's another use for

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,680
for simulators there is also

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,840
maybe for education you're teaching

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
algorithms to students

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,959
they're going to make mistakes you don't

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,040
want to break a physical robot

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,799
or maybe you don't have robots for all

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,280
everybody in class or you're

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,360
teaching online right there there are

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,320
many uses for example machine learning

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,519
uh you uh usually for machine learning

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,079
you have to

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,240
try do trial and error like thousands of

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,960
times maybe millions of times

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,240
uh of an algorithm until it gets things

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,800
right and you don't want to be doing

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,560
this with a physical robot

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,120
so um with all of these use cases

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,600
uh you have a simulated robot to help

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,040
you

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,199
let's take a look at this little robot

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,160
that i put here so um

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,360
it's a simple robot i i'm i can control

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,000
it with the keyboard here

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,639
so i'm just like turning it and you can

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
move

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,120
right and this robot has a few sensors

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,759
to fill the world to see things around

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,440
it

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,360
i put this pendulum here in the back

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,240
just to have some something else that's

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,160
going on

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,080
there's some physics running here so

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,199
this is one example

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,880
of a robot simulation that you may have

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,240
right as you may have noticed

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,160
by now i'm running the entire

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,520
presentation inside a simulator

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,080
so it's a little bit skewed to uh to

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,280
this type of simulation right now but i

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
really want you to to

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,479
think about all of the possibilities

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,039
that that simulation gives you this is

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:27,919
one of them

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:31,440
um so let's go back there to that slide

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:34,479
so um the simulator that i'm going to be

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,560
uh showing you today is called gazebo uh

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,160
we developed it at open robotics

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,880
it's actually a a very old project at

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,919
this point gazebo started in 2002 so

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,560
it's turning 18 years old and

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,080
it's had many iterations over the time

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,280
but it's always being

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,400
a multi-use robot simulator

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,720
for several use cases it never tried to

00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,880
be

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,960
specialized to a specific use case like

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,800
many uh simulators out there that are

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,440
very overly specialized

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,880
which is also a very valid approach the

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,400
approach that we've always taken with

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,479
gazebo was to try to

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,039
be a swiss army knife of robotics where

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,080
you can really

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,000
address many different use cases uh

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,440
so that that's what we've always done

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
with gazebo

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,600
and if there are people here who know

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,759
gazebo who have used gazebo

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,479
you probably used what we are referring

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,680
to right now as gazebo classic

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,880
which is the gazebo that uh has been

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,080
developed since 2012 ish

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,560
um and it has like a gray interface

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,199
and it has like a 3d scene and um

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,280
yeah it's it's a it's it looks different

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,880
from what i'm showing you right now like

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,560
some people who know gazebo may be

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240
looking at this and thinking this is not

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,440
gazebo i know gazebo gazebo

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,960
doesn't look that colorful well so

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,280
what we're doing right now at open

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,440
robotics is refactoring gazebo

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,440
into a new simulator that is still

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,479
gazebo but now we're calling it ignition

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,599
gazebo

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,479
and uh in this refactoring one of the

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,240
main goals

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,440
uh has been to make simulation as

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,160
flexible and as customizable as possible

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,240
so over the years we've heard a lot of

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,199
people using gazebo and always wanting

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,120
to tweak

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,319
parts of it people wanting to use a

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,960
slightly different

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,759
physics engines people wanting to change

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,960
the rendering

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,840
people wanting to add very specific

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,120
behaviors gazebo classic offers a lot of

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,560
ways that you can customize your

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,840
simulation you can

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,280
run some plug-ins but it's still

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,479
a monolith it's still this one

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,400
large application and uh you you

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,879
often have to pay for what you don't use

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,120
when you open the ui for example

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,560
everything is available to you

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,720
immediately there is a

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,440
editor for you to create robots inside

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,879
it there is

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,879
a plotting tool there is 3d view

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,319
you can insert models everything is

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,120
there for you available

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,000
which is very convenient but often users

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,319
don't need

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,840
all of these uh tools all of this

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,479
functionality at once

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,919
which costs resources in your computer

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,240
right as you're running it

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,680
and some and often you want simulation

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
to be as fast as possible when you

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,919
really want to

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,039
only pay for what you use so one of the

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,879
goals moving to ignition has been to

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,240
really make the simulation as

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,320
customizable as possible

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,479
as flexible as possible and as modular

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,760
as possible so you can really only take

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,959
the bits and pieces that are

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,480
interesting to you and use them

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,600
on your specific simulation so

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,600
this refactoring looks a little bit more

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,080
like this

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,680
gazebo is not a monolith anymore it's a

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,360
collection of libraries

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,040
ignition libraries that we are calling

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,519
them one of them is

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,200
ignition gazebo which kind of uses all

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,040
of the other bits and pieces puts them

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,560
together and creates a simulator which

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,200
is a simulator that we're looking at

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,880
right here but all of these bits and

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,080
pieces can also be used

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,000
on their own separate um and for other

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,320
applications there are people using

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,240
uh each one of these libraries we have a

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,040
math library we have like a

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,399
library that handles graphics we had a

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,959
library that handles the physics

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,440
abstraction or rendering abstraction

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,800
um like the the graphical interface so

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,640
there are many libraries i'm going to

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,839
talk about some of them today

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,200
um and people are using it in other

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,160
projects that are not necessarily

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,320
simulators

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,320
right so that's another point here it's

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,200
to make everything very modular and very

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,839
flexible

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,720
and the simulator itself also very

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,240
customizable

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,800
so um let's talk about how simulation

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,519
starts

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,800
right like what what are you loading

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,240
when you load a simulation

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,920
in in gazebo um like for example right

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,200
here i'm running a simulation that i've

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,240
made especially for this

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,440
uh for this presentation and

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,160
uh this everything that you see here is

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,680
described

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,480
in the simulation description format sdf

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,440
uh and i mean really everything like

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,920
from

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
where things are placed to what

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,200
graphical interface

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,800
elements are there which widgets are

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,399
there to um

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,480
what functionality is in this world

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,880
whether it's running physics or not

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,800
uh the rendering engine everything is

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,839
defined in this one file that is an

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,640
sdf file and it's an xml file so let's

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,120
take a look

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
at the file together uh i'll pull this

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,320
oops

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,720
i'll pull this a little bit here

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,240
so the file here is this dot sdf file i

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,279
hope the font is big enough for

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,120
everybody to see

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,480
the the letters um so it's xml

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,720
and you have like for example here

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,160
there's a gui tag that is defining all

00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,839
of the widgets that are inside the

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,480
simulation right now so you can see that

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,120
there is

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,120
a 3d scene there is the world control

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,600
which has the play pause button

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
in the bottom um and there are a few

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,399
other widgets

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,240
and the important thing to notice is

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,000
that if you don't put them here

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,839
you can load the simulator without them

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,160
so everything is

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,440
uh you can obtain you can opt out of

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,360
them um

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,560
there is like a key publisher there are

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,480
there are many widgets so if you're

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,000
really not gonna use something

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,920
you don't need to pay for it you just

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,519
download it

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,360
so there is a bunch of things here for

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
the ui this is a specific thing for the

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
presentation that is a custom plugin

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,680
that i wrote

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,440
that doesn't come with gazebo it's a

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,079
separate project you can just load any

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,720
plugins from from outside

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,680
you can see these four plugins here and

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,000
they are not

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,360
they're outside of the gui uh this one

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,279
is running physics

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,279
physics itself is something that you can

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,880
opt out of you can say i want to run the

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,639
simulation without physics

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,480
you just remove this block and that's

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,440
gonna happen this was not possible

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,040
on gazebo classic on gazebo classic

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,360
physics was always there it was very

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,200
opinionated about some things

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,639
need to be part of the simulation while

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,720
in ignition we're saying

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,720
hey if you just want to visualize your

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,240
robot or maybe do some path planning or

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,600
play back a log file

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,279
you probably don't need the physics so

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,959
we're going to make the physics optional

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,880
or maybe you have some slightly

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,680
different idea of what physics is and

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,320
you have your

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,839
custom physics plug-in just loading you

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
you're not stuck with hours

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,160
right and everything can be chosen at

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,040
runtime so there is like a plugin here

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,079
to handle

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,360
uh user commands so if you're sorry

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,639
about the noise

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,000
um so if you're not going to be

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,480
receiving user commands for

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,560
example you're not going to have a user

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,880
uh moving objects in the scene

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,800
or spawning objects or anything like

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,399
this you don't need those user commands

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,880
so you can just throw it away

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,959
and and it goes on and the same way that

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,279
there are these four here there's like

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,800
lots of plugins that i didn't put here

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,360
right for example there is a wins

00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,440
plug-in

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,880
that i didn't need for the simulation so

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,959
i just did it included

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,720
there is a buoyancy plug-in right if

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,680
you're doing an underwater world and you

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,680
need things to

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,360
be buoyant or even like you want things

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,600
to float in air

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,120
you can add a plug-in for that i didn't

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,560
add it because that's not the simulation

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,040
that i'm running

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,480
so everything is optional and then below

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,000
here you can see that i have the

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,880
entities themselves that are inside the

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,920
simulation so

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,040
lights models um

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,880
you know and everything from

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,880
the visual description to the physical

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,639
description of objects is here

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,279
you can see that i have some models that

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,880
i'm just loading them from a website

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,600
from a server and i'm going to show you

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,440
guys a little bit how this works

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,880
but you know you don't have to have all

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,199
the resources uh

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,639
on your computer you can just like refer

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,199
to these resources that are

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,880
available online and and and load them

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,240
which which are available for free you

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,079
know

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
for example you can see here that there

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,720
are some physical descriptions you can

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,760
see the mass

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,839
of the vehicle you can see um

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
its collision property so it has like a

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,560
box so it's going to collide with other

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,240
things

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,320
you can see visual properties and

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,120
materials and what it's going to look

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,399
like

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,800
so everything is defined in this

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:21,680
sdf file so let's go back to our

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,680
simulation here

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,680
so i hope you got a good idea of how the

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,399
simulation was

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,199
composed together right and how

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,040
everything

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,959
here that you're seeing can be just

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,000
removed and other things can be

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,000
easily added as well

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,839
um so yeah i mentioned that website

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,839
where

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,000
models are in and that's uh

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,720
ignitionrobotics.org

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,639
we have an online database of sdf files

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,160
that are ready to be put into simulation

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,480
and that's not limited to gazebo there

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,120
are other simulators using sd format

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,560
as does as their description format and

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,560
you can see here that you can find like

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,240
humanoid robots there are self-driving

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,199
cars there are quadcopters

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,040
it's it's really a multi-use simulator

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,199
for for many different use cases

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,959
and you can find a lot of these models

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,399
there let me

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,639
show you how it works for example

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,320
let me pull my browser here and i have

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,639
the website loaded

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,600
so you can see that there are several

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,320
models here

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,320
that are ready to be inserted into

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,880
simulation you can choose one

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,639
and it's as simple as just like coming

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,120
here in this drag b button

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,839
and dragging it into the broad the the

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,720
simulation

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,399
and voila you have um a little model

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,680
here and it has physical properties so

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,680
it's i like

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,920
if i pull it up it falls with gravity

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,800
so they're ready for simulation for you

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,120
and then you could

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,079
have a robot here that is manipulating

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
squirrels

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,000
i guess if that's what your application

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,600
is

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,240
so i really recommend you you check out

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,399
that website to see if there are

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,320
uh the models that you need or also to

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,000
upload your models to the website so

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,959
other people can also use it

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,959
in their simulations

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,639
um so the other part of the story i

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,240
showed you the xml

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,160
but you saw that it was loading a lot of

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,680
plugins right and all of these plugins

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,560
are written in c plus plus

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,839
uh so everything from the graphical

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,920
interface plugins to

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,959
the physics plugins to the rendering

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,320
plugins everything

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,600
here are written in c plus plus and that

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,800
that's something that i think it's it's

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,800
important to point out

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,560
in case people were expecting for a more

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,399
like scripting interface

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,120
um you ignition doesn't support it

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,360
directly

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,199
but for example you could use ross the

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,720
robot operating system to control your

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,000
robot using python

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,440
or javascript or you know ros has

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,120
bindings for many languages

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,040
and then you control the robot inside

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,320
the simulation uh

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
through plugins that are already

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,600
provided for you for example so you

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,079
don't need to use c plus plus you can

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,160
use

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,000
other frameworks like ros but if you

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,839
want to use the simulator directly

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
then that's uh you're going to have to

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,720
write some c plus plus plugins or load

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,319
some c plus plus

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,240
so let's talk about physics um the

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,240
the simulation here

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,679
why is it stopped oh the pendulum got to

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,199
arrest

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,160
that yeah chaotic behavior huh it got

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,959
kind of tired um so let's talk about

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,880
physics

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,799
which i assume is one thing that

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
almost all of you probably thought of

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,320
when you thought of robot simulation

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,320
you like it when i asked you to imagine

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,440
your simulation you probably think well

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,320
it needs physics running right

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,679
and some people may be thinking well how

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,000
can physics be

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,919
customizable or flexible right like

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,799
physics is one thing we know the real

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,799
world we have

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,039
like we know that we throw something to

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,960
the top and it falls with gravity and

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,320
it's always the same answer there are no

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,039
multiple answers for physics right well

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,679
the reality is that the world the real

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,360
world

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,280
is very complicated like you have people

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,640
making art outside you know the real

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,550
world is complicated

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,679
so uh

00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,480
[Music]

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,280
so there is there are different levels

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,679
of detail

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,320
that you can simulate you can simulate

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,280
the behavior of atoms and you can

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,240
simulate the behavior of planets and you

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,320
know

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,840
there are there are many things in

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,240
between there

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,240
usually for simulation what people think

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,320
of is rigid body dynamics

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,280
so you have something kind of like this

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,200
pendulum here

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,840
which is composed of like simple bodies

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,720
that are

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:45,919
um that are moving like you know

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,679
that are moving uh according to forces

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,080
that are being applied to them

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,280
um but they are not deformable they are

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,240
not breakable

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,000
uh but there are other uh simulation

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,160
applications that may be more interested

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
in soft bodies or other robot

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,039
applications that may not even be

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,120
interested in um any

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,600
dynamics at all they're just interested

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,000
in knowing where the robot is think of

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,880
like you have a warehouse with 100

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,039
robots

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,960
and you really don't care about the

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,760
angles of the wheels of every single

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,080
robot

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,960
and what's the force that the floor is

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,039
doing and

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,480
for all of the robots in the world right

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,080
you really just want to know

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,600
where the robots are and whether they

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,760
bumped into a human or if they're

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,160
bumping into each other or if they're

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,919
very close to a wall if they drop the

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,280
product you know that that's the level

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,679
of detail that you want

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:40,000
so you can really

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,720
this isn't very distracting so you can

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,160
really

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,640
um yeah change like

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,520
tune the simulation for for your use

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
case

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,840
that's why on ignition we have a physics

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,799
abstraction layer that we call the

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,480
ignition physics

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,240
it's a one of the libraries in the

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,400
ecosystem and

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,679
you can pretty much load different

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,640
physics engines

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,840
into your simulation and you can choose

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,760
them at runtime

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,000
so the important thing to notice here is

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,760
that you describe your world

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,080
using sd format once and once you load

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,880
the

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,679
the simulation you can choose the

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
physics engine

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,640
on the fly and you don't need to change

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,559
uh your world to adapt to each different

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,720
physics engine so it makes it very easy

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,919
for you to just try different things

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:31,280
so by default we have support for dart

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,840
um and then we also developed

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,760
this tpe engine in-house which stands

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,799
for trivial physics engine

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,559
that uh whose goal is to be

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,600
very simple very uh it doesn't do

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,360
dynamics

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,080
it only does kinematics you set a

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,280
velocity and a model goes and it doesn't

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,600
collide with anything

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,320
it just keeps going until you tell it to

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,640
stop

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,640
and that's very useful for cases where

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,760
you have like hundreds of robots and you

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,240
are not really interested in the

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,679
dynamics we have some partial support

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,200
for bullet as well

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,120
and the important thing is that it's

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,600
since it's plug-in based

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,640
anyone can write a plug-in to their own

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,480
physics engine

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,280
and easily load it into the simulator

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,120
and

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,559
they don't need to worry about if

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,919
special to these physics they don't need

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,400
to worry about

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,200
rendering they don't need to worry about

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
uh

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,480
like the graphical interface they don't

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,159
need to

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,000
care about all of the other bits and

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,520
pieces all of all that they

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,960
need to care about is their specialty

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
they're specialized in the physics

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,200
engine

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,039
they're interested in a very specific

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,640
behavior they can leverage

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,960
the rest of the ecosystem and really

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,000
focus on what they're good at

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,440
let me show you um an example of the

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,280
simulation here i told you that it's

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,600
right now running with dart

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,600
and

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,159
so if like you know you can see the dart

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,240
has

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,919
the dynamics here for the pendulum it

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,679
has friction of the wheels with the

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,400
floor that's why the wheels

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,000
are moving right so let's close the

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,840
simulation right now

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,520
and i'm going to reload it with ppe

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,960
which is the trivial physics i did

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:16,320
um here so it's the same command as

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,120
i used originally but now i'm passing it

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,720
this physics engine tp that's it the

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,600
file that i'm loading is the same one

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,600
that i showed you before

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,400
and then here we are so let's go to the

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,799
robot

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,159
and now you can see that i can still

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,000
control the robot

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,159
but the wheels are not turning you can

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,120
see that the pendulum is stopped

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,080
and that's fine that's what this

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,360
specific

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,280
uh physics engine is is made to do it's

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,799
just the high level behavior of the

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,200
robot and it's

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,799
much faster like right now i'm

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,960
throttling that simulation to run at

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,360
real time so the simulation time is the

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,240
same

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,039
as our real time but you know it could

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,559
be running

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:03,280
um much faster than dart would

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,880
with uh many robots for example you

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,760
could run like

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,440
10 15 times faster than real time if you

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,960
really want simulation to go fast and to

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,120
get some quick results

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,799
right so that's an example with dbe

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,559
so let me close the simulation and go

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,039
back to loading with dart

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,240
because it's so sad not to have the

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,360
pendulum moving

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,120
so i just removed the physics engine

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,799
and we are back to our world with actual

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,039
physics

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,039
so

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,480
um let's talk about sensors so i showed

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,640
you

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,400
our physics abstraction layer um

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,919
my mouse is stuck in one of the windows

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,480
okay so

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,600
um i showed you the physics abstraction

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,520
how it works

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,880
how it's useful to have different

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,039
physics

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,559
but a simulator is not only about

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,279
physics i hope that when you guys

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,480
thought about what your simulator would

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,600
look like and what

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,760
you need from a simulator many of you uh

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,440
probably also thought of sensors right

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,440
the robot is not blind

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,799
just moving around without collecting

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,960
any data

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,320
it's very important for the robots to

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,760
sense that world

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,159
right here inside the matrix we're

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,559
trying to fool you we have to create

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,679
a fake world for the robot to be in

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,640
there

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,400
and uh there are many types of sensors

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,840
that people use in physical robots and

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,559
we have to simulate them all inside

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,559
simulation

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:35,840
so on everything from imuse to gps

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,640
to bumper sensors right all of these

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,840
things

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,720
are necessary for like if you want to

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,320
have the same

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,159
the behavior of the physical robot

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,360
inside the simulation you have to

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,760
fake that data uh but perhaps the type

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,640
of data that people focus on the most

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,240
is rendering data so data that can be

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,279
generated with a rendering engine

00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,159
so images or for example lidar data

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,679
right like lidar are those like depth

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,440
sensors that you can see

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,120
how far things are around that

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,400
self-driving cars usually have that big

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,200
lighter on the top

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,480
um those things we simulate with a

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,360
rendering engine

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:18,880
and um the

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,960
the rendering engine uh can be

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,919
it's also in a spectrum right like

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,200
reality is

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,400
very detailed uh has very good

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,159
resolution

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,600
uh has amazing effect right reality but

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,120
if you're going to simulate all of that

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,840
that's going to be very resource

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,080
intensive

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,440
and often you don't need that if you're

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,120
just uh

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,880
if you just have a simple robot that

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,559
just wants to see if something is closed

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,559
in front of it or if it

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,320
there is a red blob in front of it and

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,279
the robot just follows red blobs

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,440
it doesn't need very high definition red

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,400
bulbs and very photorealistic right it

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,840
just needs

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,760
something that puts a red blob in front

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,279
of it in the right place

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,600
as it moves so um

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,720
there is also a spectrum there to choose

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,760
your rendering engines

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,799
that's why you guessed it we also have a

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,440
abstraction layer for rendering by

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,880
default

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,520
we support an ogre one which is an

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,159
open source rendering engine and one is

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,400
the the

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,240
one point x versions so 1.9 1.10 1.12

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,520
we support them we have a plug-in for

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,360
them but we also support

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,200
augur 2 which is actually the default

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,080
which is that what i'm running here

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,440
and ogre 2 compared to over 1 has more

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,760
modern features

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,000
it supports physically based rendering

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,279
which has a lot of nice special

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,720
uh like more realistic effects so it

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,039
looks much more real but uh you know

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,760
as was the case with the physics if you

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,360
have a different

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,880
rendering engine if you really want to

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,200
use a different engine that has

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,000
different features uh maybe it's a

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,039
rendering engine

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,559
that is more specialized um

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,960
into human faces or another one that is

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,440
more

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,200
specialized into terrain and you need

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,960
the terrain to be very realistic

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,960
you can just integrate those rendering

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,840
engines and and use them in your

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,320
simulation

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,200
as a plug-in and it's the same situation

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,320
with the physics

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,240
you can uh load your simulation you just

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,399
design the simulation once with the sdf

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,640
file and then you just

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,240
at runtime say run with this render

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,840
engine and the render engine is even

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
cooler than the physics because you can

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,120
have

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,679
a different render engine for you as the

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,520
user

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,559
and another render engine for the robot

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,559
let me show you what i mean

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,240
so for example here this guy uh has two

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,159
sensors

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,919
a lighter and a camera let's take a look

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,520
at the lighter first

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,440
um so this is what the lighter looks

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,120
like right i put just a very simple

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,080
lighter in the robot

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,520
so these are rays that can sense uh when

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,120
there's something in front

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,720
of the robot and uh each one of the rays

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,120
is independent and feels

00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,919
the that depth so if we get for example

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,840
close to the

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,520
pendulum we can see

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,360
that whenever like the pendulum kind of

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,679
hits those rays

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,960
the the robot senses that there is

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,720
something there

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,480
right this is one of the sensors this is

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,159
all done with the rendering engine

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,240
the other one is the camera the robot

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,120
has a camera located in the same place

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,640
as the

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:26,399
as the uh lighter

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,799
so the robot can see the

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,399
the pendulum as well and this is what

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,799
i'm talking about here

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,679
it happens that i'm using the same

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,320
rendering engine

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,080
for my view and for the robot's view but

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,799
you could use for example a very

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,279
realistic

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,080
engine for the robot if you want because

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,799
you really

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,720
are interested in that photo realism but

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,240
for you as the person debugging the

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,159
program you don't really need the photo

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,440
realism you just want things to run fast

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,279
and you just really want to see where

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,559
things are so you could use a

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,720
quicker uh less resource intensive

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,399
render engine for your own view

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,760
and leave the robot there with with

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,279
their

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:09,200
fancy view and those two can co-exist

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,760
it's fine let me show you an example of

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,480
what ogre 2 can do that over one can so

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,679
for

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,159
you can see this the reflections here on

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,200
this

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,480
uh fire extinguisher the detail here i

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,399
hope it's going through

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,000
uh properly through the internet you

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,600
know um

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,120
but you can see that there is a lot of

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,760
detail there is a lot

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,480
of like when i move the camera there is

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,720
like

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,520
this environment map that we call which

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,600
is

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,799
the lighting faking the lighting that is

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,799
surrounding the object

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,559
as if there were some objects around it

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,600
and when you move it you can really see

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,039
that

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,880
you can do this with ogre one for

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,760
example with auger one the maximum that

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,320
you could get

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,679
is something that looks like this right

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,080
it's not so shiny

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,720
um it doesn't have that environment map

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,960
and

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,760
you know it doesn't have that metallic

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,360
feel

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,720
here on the on on this dial

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,960
and so on so um you know

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,000
i recommend that you try like to load

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,279
the simulation

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,120
with ogre and ogre 2 and see the ogre 1

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,360
and over 2 and see the differences

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,360
in how these things are being rendered

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,480
so let's go

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,360
to our rendering engines

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,039
so same idea as the physics it's plugin

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,720
based

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,720
let's talk about the graphical interface

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,399
now um

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,640
everything that you're seeing here as i

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:40,000
showed you in the sda file

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,520
is optional you know the these items

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,399
here so you can

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,960
pick things and move them around you can

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,159
insert

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,760
objects into the simulation

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,080
all of these widgets here are optional

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,880
you choose to have them there if it

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,360
makes sense

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,760
you can build your custom dashboard

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,919
specific to your simulation

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,600
and then you can put other plugins in it

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,279
there is a list here of plugins that

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,159
come

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,919
with ignition gazebo for you when you

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,799
when you install it so let me try for

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,399
example

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:18,159
here the entity tree this shows you

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,760
all of the uh entities that are inside

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,279
the simulation you can see in the double

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,720
pendulum for example that it has an

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,360
upper link and it has some visuals

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
inside

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,960
so you can really inspect and you can

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,120
say like move to and you

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,880
go to the pendulum um and you can see it

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,960
there there is for example component

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,679
inspector so when you select the double

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,480
pendulum

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,559
you can really see um you know

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,480
information about each part of it so if

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,240
you see for example the lower link

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,080
you can see its pose and how it's

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,960
changing

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,919
in real time for example another one

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,519
that is cool to see

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,519
is the plotting so

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,360
if i go down here the body showed up

00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,480
here so i can drag any of these values

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,480
my mouse is getting stuck to

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,519
the plot and you can see here this is

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,600
the roll

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,760
uh which is one of the the three

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,640
rotations of the lower link

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,159
of the of the pendulum and it's you're

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,360
just plotting it in real time you can

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,279
export it to

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,919
a file if you want um a csv file so you

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,600
can

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,760
use it on your paper you can

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,279
use this as as you need and then you can

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,120
also like collapse these ones and you

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,279
can have more

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,240
widgets here as you need for your own

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,240
specific use case

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,519
so um what else can i say about the gui

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,880
it's very customizable you can save your

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,120
client configuration

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,559
so when you open the next time all of

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,120
the widgets are going to be

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,880
located in the same place you can choose

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,240
for example light or dark

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,080
theme if you're interested in that

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,840
you can change even like the colors of

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,679
the ui um

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,200
if you don't like the default colors and

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,799
then just

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,200
have your local configuration always

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,519
load things the way that is best for you

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,840
for

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,559
your workflow and you know matches your

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,200
preferences

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:18,640
all of this is using qt quick with qml

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,720
gazebo classic used qt widgets which had

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,360
a more

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,760
more scientific software look and feel

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,480
the

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,200
qml we're using it with material design

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,519
which really allows us to have these

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,720
more modern look almost like look looks

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,919
like a web

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,240
interface with a lot of shadows and

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,279
a lot of like animations to to move

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,519
things around

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,360
and this is all like you know you can

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,120
write your own plugins for your own use

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,399
cases and there are people using

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,279
uh ignition gui for other things

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,399
besides ignition gazebo for example

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,039
there is um

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,000
a project that is using ignition gui and

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,559
ignition rendering

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,600
to render data coming from a real

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,080
physical robot

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,840
in 3d so you can inspect that data and

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,240
you can see data from many robots at the

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,039
same time in the same place so they are

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,399
not using

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,480
ignition gazebo they are not using the

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,839
simulator they don't need to load the

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,760
physics engine they don't even need to

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,599
load the ignition physics

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,119
they're just using the graphical

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,480
interface and the rendering and that's

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,399
really what we wanted

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,919
by breaking gazebo apart like this is

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,079
for people to leverage

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,359
the each one of the parts independently

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,200
in their own projects

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,960
there is a another project using

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,480
ignition green ignition rendering

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,399
for uh path planning of robots

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,839
there is a different simulator that is

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,440
using ignition glue and ignition

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,639
rendering with their own

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,079
uh physics uh layer that is not

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,919
based on ignition physics and that's

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,399
fine so

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,399
that that's very uh that's the real

00:34:46,399 --> 00:35:03,839
point like we want people to use these

00:34:48,399 --> 00:35:03,839
things in different places

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,200
um our like latest uh

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,760
developments all of our releases uh

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,560
here is the site for this presentation

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
the the

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,599
repository where i have this

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,240
presentation specifically

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,359
that you can just clone and run uh in

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,599
your computer

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,440
i'm always on twitter um posting about

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,040
simulation if people are interested

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,359
and here hashtag sim slides uh it's the

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,280
the project that i have to run slides

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,880
inside simulation and it works with both

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,320
gazebo classic and ignition

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,800
so yeah let me know if you have any

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,240
questions and i'd be happy to answer

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,079
them

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,920
thank you thank you so much louise

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,119
um i do see one question here from dave

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,599
can the separate function of a robot and

00:35:53,119 --> 00:36:00,880
effector be modeled with the robot

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,280
can which function can the

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,160
separate function of a robot end

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,839
effector

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,839
be modeled with the robot

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,680
i i don't think i understood the

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,240
question sorry it's what

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,560
what function of the robot of the enemy

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,520
no worries uh david if you want to

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,160
to clarify your question oh he said like

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,400
a paint

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,400
gun

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:30,640
um so do you mean like if you can create

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,359
a robot that has in its end effector

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,480
attached

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,400
um some some specific like tool uh

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,560
and yeah that that's entirely possible

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,079
you just defined that in the sdf file

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,760
and you set the correct physics

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,440
properties uh for it

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,960
and visual properties then you're good

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,040
to go

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,560
okay dave said yes so so thank you

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,560
louise i think you answered his question

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,160
anybody has any other questions for

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,720
louise please do place them

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,160
um either in the q a box the chat box or

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,560
you can raise your hand whichever you

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,480
prefer

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,320
but but that was a great presentation

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,160
louise thank you so much again

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,760
now thank you for the opportunity sorry

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,119
about the all the noise here i really

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,040
thought they were done before i

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:19,200
started the presentation that's okay

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,200
life happens we're in virtual world

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,119
we have a question here if we want to

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,079
make ai

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,839
to run the robot that would probably

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,520
have to be a plug-in

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,920
correct yes correct so you can have a

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,440
plug-in for example that

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,800
is reading the sensor data here and

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,760
is is processing that data and making

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,720
some decision

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,720
and sending comments to the robot people

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,520
usually use ros for this kind of stuff

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,000
just because ross comes with a lot of uh

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,359
tools

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,200
out of the box for you to to add all

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,720
kinds of behaviors to your robot

00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,200
uh raz is the robot operating system and

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,520
we have an interface to ross that you

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,680
can easily use

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,440
ignition with ross and then if you're

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,880
using ros you don't need to write an

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,359
ignition plug-in you could just

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,960
write a raw script that can be a python

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,359
script it can be

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,320
um you know it can be c plus plus as

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,079
well but

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,640
ros is a little bit more flexible with

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,640
the languages

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,320
thank you louise uh question here from

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,119
james

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,359
just to be clear these are these tools

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,640
available for free

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,960
yes yeah i so i i did say pay uh but

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,960
yeah

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,800
it's it's a like don't pay for what you

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,240
don't use but pay with resources

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,520
of uh like computing resources

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,880
so you know uh the simulator all of the

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,280
code is open source it's all apache

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,680
apache2 licensed you can just take it

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,359
and do whatever you want with it you can

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,839
ship a product with it and you don't

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,960
need to tell us anything

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,720
perfect thank you

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,880
another question here this one's from

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:05,440
rebecca does gazebo

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,760
work with labview or java based robots

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,720
so yeah for for integrating with this

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
kind of uh

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,240
with these other softwares i really

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,079
recommend going through ros

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,640
because i've seen people using ross with

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,359
labview i've i've seen people using

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,880
uh you know there's ros java uh both

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,320
ros1 and ros2

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,480
um so i like i recommend

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,320
you leverage ross for for this kind of

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,680
like robot software because then you can

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,200
run the same software

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,200
for your physical robot and for your

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,760
simulated robot if you wrote something

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,400
that is

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,760
an ignition plug-in that would work well

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,920
for the simulation

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,440
but that wouldn't translate well to your

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,400
real robot that doesn't know anything

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,400
about ignition

00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,720
