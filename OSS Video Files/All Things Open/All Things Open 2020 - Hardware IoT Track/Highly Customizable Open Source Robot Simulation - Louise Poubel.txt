Abstract: Simulation has long been a powerful tool in the development of robots. Without the limitations of hardware, developers can iterate quicker and more safely on their algorithms. Simulation can also be used for continuous integration, machine learning and education. This talk will introduce the latest version of the Gazebo simulator, which is one of the most used simulators in robotics. The new version is based on modular libraries that can be reused in a wide variety of robotics applications. It supports highly customizable graphical interfaces, rendering and physics, and can be used on domains ranging from air, ground and underwater. All this together with first-class support for the Robot Operating System (ROS), which is the de facto standard framework for robot development today.
