Abstract: In this session we'll walk through building a voice application using Jovo.  Jovo is an open source JavaScript framework that helps you build cross platform voice applications across Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Samsung Bixby, Twilio Autopilot, Facebook Messenger, and others.  It is the most popular cross platform tool for voice with over 20,000 projects.  Jovo allows you to maintain a single piece of source code and deploy it to many of the most popular voice devices.  We will take a look at the quick development workflow of developing using Jovo, build a sample application together, and discuss some drawbacks you may experience.

	00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,040
all right well

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,519
um that was my first slide there

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,559
move this over here um so my name is

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,839
nate collins and

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,760
i'm a senior software engineer at

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,359
teamwork's a company in durham

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,199
we build uh software for collegiate

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,560
professional sports

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,680
and in my day-to-day i'm a full stack

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,439
developer and i

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,599
i actually don't work on voice apps

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,120
but the jovo framework is something that

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,800
i found very intriguing

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,840
and as a um backend and a front-end full

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,120
stack developer

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
it's something i've been wanting to get

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,760
into a lot more and

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
uh for fun they're the one wheel in

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,000
there and i've gotten into some dutch

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,600
oven cooking

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,719
some fun facts but um like many of you

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,039
and one of the reasons why i wanted to

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,000
talk about this was because

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,960
many of us are busy creating mobile apps

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,039
cross-platform

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
you know with react native and other

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,359
such platforms

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,400
uh we're busy developing web apps and

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,840
we've just kind of looked

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,520
over and glanced at this voice

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,520
technology and

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,280
i haven't had a moment to take a look at

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,240
it and so

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,320
what i hope from today is that you can

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,200
see how easy it is to get

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,200
a skill out there and deploy it using

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,360
jovo

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,360
the for me i read an article i think it

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,600
was this one it was one very similar to

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,799
it but my realization was that

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,040
uh you know about voice was that the

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,680
music industry because so many people

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,600
play songs on their smart speakers the

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,640
music industry was

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,360
having to change the way they name

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,159
albums the way they name artists and

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,079
also

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,320
not just that but metadata so when

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,759
somebody says play happy songs

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,600
you know play sad songs things like that

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,000
they they need their songs to actually

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,360
surface in these uh smart speakers

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,799
so this uh very ancient and slow to move

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,479
industry

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,840
was one of the first i think to start

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,200
scrambling due to this new voice

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,479
technology

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,440
if you look at the front page of

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,280
the uh developer page it was there for a

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,280
while actually didn't check it today

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,879
but a successful person there mark is uh

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,840
quoted as saying there's no future that

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,720
doesn't have ambient computing or voice

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,800
activation there's another quote that

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,200
mark said that i think is even

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,080
more powerful and he said it previously

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,520
he said

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
if i were going to start a business

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,560
today i'd build it around alexa and

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,440
google home

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,120
there is certainly a lot of excitement

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,879
and a lot of future

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,239
behind building voice applications and

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,920
so today we're going to talk about jovo

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,360
framework now you can

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,319
obviously build each voice app

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,120
natively with each respective

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,720
environment

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,640
so with amazon alexa they've got a

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,120
console you can build there

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,280
with google assistant you can build uh

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,879
using their tools there

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,200
what job does is it allows you to build

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,120
one voice application with a single

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,599
source code and deploy it to multiple

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,239
places the platforms that it supports

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:17,519
are amazon alexa google assistant uh dia

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,080
dialog flow uh integrations samsung

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,760
bixby

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,519
twilio autopilot and then facebook

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,080
messenger and there's others

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,280
the one of the things that just changed

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,920
days ago

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,840
was the conversational actions which

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,480
jovo just picked up

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,280
and uh or they just integrated with and

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,200
and

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,480
today we'll just focus in on amazon

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,720
alexa just because

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,080
there's so much to go over and it's a

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,000
very similar

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,920
uh track if you're building between

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,519
amazon alexa and google assistant

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,519
especially now that conversational

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,159
actions are are included

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,080
it used to be that you'd have to uh with

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,680
google assistant you'd have to not only

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
integrate with google assistant but also

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,200
include dialog flow

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,519
that dialog flow step is removed and so

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,239
it's a lot more seamless

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,799
to do it that way uh if you'd like to

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,519
contribute

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,200
jovotek or jovo is open source and so

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,000
there's a nice web page here on on who

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,480
to con

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,599
on how to contribute and i did want to

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,760
give a little shout out

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,280
i'm probably missing some people but

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,519
that you know the

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,400
contributors to jovo put him on the

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,280
screen there

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
i've had interactions with jan and i

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,560
think

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,919
probably a few others but jan has been

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,400
super supportive

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,880
very helpful and just a great team

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,880
behind it

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,160
so a few acronyms to know

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,840
when we get into the voice realm we're

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,040
entering into the space of artificial

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,520
intelligence

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,160
many of you much more expert than myself

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
and

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,440
so today we're not going to go deep dive

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
into what is artificial intelligence and

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,000
where

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,600
where his voice is placed in that etc

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,560
but there's just a few acronyms to know

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,000
when we're trying to build something one

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,520
of the reasons why i mentioned mark

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,080
cuban's uh speak our quote there about

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,160
if he were to build a company he would

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,039
build it around voice

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,919
the um the reason why i mentioned that

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,919
was because

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,440
in today's talk i'd like to talk about

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,880
not so much building a company but

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,759
building a product

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,479
how can we actually use this to build a

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,560
product

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,800
to you know sell something create

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,400
something add something to the world

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,560
so the uh three acronyms here

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,919
there's asr which is automatic speech

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,320
recognition

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,520
that really covers a lot more than just

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,440
speech to text

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,600
but we'll just call it speech to text

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,600
for right now there's nlp which is

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,280
natural language processing

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,039
the you can think of that as the big

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,440
circle where as an

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,199
nlu naturally natural language

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
understanding is a smaller circle within

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,440
that

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,039
with natural language processing we're

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,080
talking about all the things

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,199
relating to like human um interpreting

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,880
what you know having a computer

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,440
interpret what a human is saying

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,000
and then nlu itself is you know what is

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,840
the intent of what they're trying to say

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,120
the you know if i say hey could you

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,160
close the door

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,120
if i say hey shut the door hey go close

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,479
that

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,840
you know there's there's there's

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,199
different ways that humans can say

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,600
things what's my intent

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,280
and the computer has to map that to he

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,560
wants the door closed

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,840
and so that's what uh nlu does

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,960
and that's in a nutshell jovo

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,479
has this idea of the rider pipeline

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,919
and the uh it is pretty straightforward

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,319
it's what you would expect

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,360
but if you're brand brand new to voice

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,600
technology

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,639
let's start at the beginning so in the

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,400
beginning here

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,800
there is a smart device such as an alexa

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
or a google assistant where it records

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,160
your voice

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,680
and once it detects that silence it will

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,520
send that

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,280
that audio file off to be interpreted

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,720
that's where asr and nlu come into play

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,720
as it tries to interpret hey what is the

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,319
intent of what this user is trying to

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,280
say or do

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,400
and ultimately with voice technology

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,240
you're trying to map

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,919
a voice interaction with a function

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,280
but as you'll see it's a little bit more

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,360
than that

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,720
as we get into the logic but basically

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,599
we're trying to just map

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
what someone said to a function and

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,880
later on we've got the dialogue and

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,560
logic and that's where you got your user

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,080
data your api calls that's where things

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,440
start to get really interesting

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,680
and then the response could be voice

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,199
most likely voice it could be text it

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,960
could be display

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,720
there's lots of different ways that we

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,639
interact with these devices

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,080
so one of the reasons why i want to talk

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,759
about the rider pipeline was because i

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,319
think it really illustrates

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,560
how cross-platform jovo is we're not

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,199
just talking alexa

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,000
versus google assistant we're talking

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,160
about

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,080
you know in the front there as far as

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,000
taking in the actual audio clip

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,680
there's a whole host of devices that you

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,840
can utilize but then

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,080
all the way down the pipeline you can

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,800
swap out vendors swap out

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
tools and it's just really interesting

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,479
so

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,720
um that that to me really captures what

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,479
uh

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,639
what job was about with the with the

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:16,080
writer pipeline right there

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,879
the uh so

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,840
the basics of the jovo framework is that

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
the

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,160
um jovo consists of several libraries

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,160
that have been extracted so that

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
things are a little more simple to

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,639
maintain the

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,760
jovo cly or the jovo client is

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,200
is used for interactions between the

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,880
various platforms

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
and your code and we'll go over that

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,080
today the jovo model

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,000
is probably one of my favorites and that

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,240
is it's an abstraction layer

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,760
that helps you create these intents

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,160
across platforms

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,920
and and keep it in a file that can be

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,200
version controlled across teams and i

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,760
think that's probably

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
that vote was one of my favorite things

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,720
the jovo framework

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,720
itself is the uh request response cycle

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,760
where it's actually parsing the request

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,440
and

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,839
providing some abstraction layer there

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,600
so you can easily do things without

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,279
having to do so much work

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,120
so we'll get right into it let's build

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,240
something and

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,480
you can follow along on my github i've

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
got a repo there i can display this at

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,399
the end again if

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,160
um if i take it off too soon but i'm

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,800
gonna go ahead and

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,000
switch screens here sorry i won't be

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,000
looking at the camera so much

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,839
and oh this might be a good place just

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,839
to take a just a quick question

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,959
nate i don't see any questions as of

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
right now just as a reminder if anyone

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,000
has any for nate

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,680
uh please feel free to either raise your

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,720
hand put them in the chat box or the q

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,839
a box thank you cool

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,399
all right let's see here oh there we go

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,880
so stop

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,880
sharing

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,560
nate we do have one person asking if you

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:13,519
could please share that link

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,519
oh absolutely what a smart idea um

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,399
so if i chat it here i think that'll

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,160
work right

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,680
and i think chris actually just shared

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:32,480
it so thank you chris

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:35,600
okay thank you guys okay so okay can

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,600
everybody see my screen here

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,000
and then feel free to shout out if um

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,360
if it's if the font is too small or

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,200
something

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,120
hopefully yeah maybe make it just a

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,360
little bit bigger if you don't mind nate

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,120
okay thank you let's see here

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,120
all right make that a little bigger i'm

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,839
not sure how to make the terminal

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,959
oh there we go bigger gotcha

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,959
okay so

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,560
what we're gonna do right now is uh

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,279
basically

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,880
build a skill on alexa do it on google

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,600
actions as well but we just don't have

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,519
time

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,600
and we're gonna cover a lot i thought

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
that covering all of the

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,640
things that i i think are necessary to

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,160
build it

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,839
is more important than than kind of

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,200
proving that jobo does it across

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,040
google and alexa yeah what you'll see in

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,440
alexa is very similar in google

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,040
just you know pick what you'd like to do

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
alexa seems to have the market share

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,079
right now so it's a good one to develop

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,600
for

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,519
the okay so the first thing we're gonna

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,320
do is just do a little hello world and

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,880
in this i want to

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,760
really uh show the importance of jogo

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,440
cly

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,200
so i'm going to go to alexa developer

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,560
console and i'm going to just create a

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,880
skill

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,880
in the

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,760
okay when i create a skill i'll just go

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,880
ahead and name this

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,079
arie i forgot to explain

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,920
what we'll be creating today is a air

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,120
filter helper for lack of a better

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,399
imagination

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,480
um what i thought would be a tool is

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,120
uh that would be helpful is basically

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,920
remind you when an air filter

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,279
in your house needs to be changed and

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,839
those should be changed like every 90

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,000
days

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,680
and so it happens frequently but

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,079
sometimes my house will go like six

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,240
months

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,839
and i'll be very amazed by how dirty the

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,200
air filter looks

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,279
and so this will be a clean air helper

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,240
and ways to possibly monetize this could

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,959
be to

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,399
you know add have some way of ordering

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,760
via the app but we won't go into that

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
today

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,959
so what we're going to do is uh the two

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,000
things it'll do is it'll record when we

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,760
last changed it

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,399
and tell us and it will um also remember

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,560
the

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,160
location and size of the air filters

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,200
that we need to know

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,040
and remember to buy at the store and

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,560
then extra credit would have been send a

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,839
notification 90 days later to

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:10,000
change your air filters the

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,000
um so here on step one

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,760
of what we're going to do is we're

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,680
actually going to go straight to alexa

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,519
developer console simply because if we

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,560
look at the

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,120
the jovo model right away

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,079
it won't be as intuitive as this i mean

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,480
this is a ui

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,839
this is this is very beautiful but

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,279
you'll soon find that it's a little bit

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,959
slow and tedious

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,160
so the um basically to create a skill we

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,279
just name it

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,079
and we will we will click provision

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,000
our own backend resource and we will

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,199
keep custom selected

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,199
and we'll create a skill

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,639
right here i don't know why you can't

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,279
just say like don't do a template

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,560
but you have to click a template so

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,560
hello world is a good one

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,560
all right so we've got our skill named

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,639
arie

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,000
and uh within the console there's a lot

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,240
to go over but we'll just

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,639
stay with what we need to know right now

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
in the invocation

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
this is what's going to bring up your

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
skill so when you tell alexa

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
i want to do this skill this is what

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,800
it's going to be

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,079
so what we're going to do here is just

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,079
call air filter check

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,519
at that point we can hit save up here

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,920
you can see it's training the model

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,800
and and doing some various things

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
there's a save

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,560
and then there's also a build where it

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,680
will build the model

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,279
so what i want to do first let me make

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,279
sure i grab the right intent name here

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,639
i want to go over what an intent is

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,600
so when we look at the intents we can

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,600
see that there's standard intents there

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,120
the intents are what i i talked about

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,040
previously where

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,480
a human says something what is the what

00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
is the meaning behind it what is the

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,959
intent of what they're trying to

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,480
accomplish

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,040
so i'll go ahead and delete this hello

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,240
world one and we've got these

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,720
uh amazon basic ones as you can imagine

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,480
uh fallback intent stop intent help

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,079
intent these are just kind of default

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,920
values of

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,120
kind of good to have in your app etc

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,360
so what i'm going to do right now is

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,120
create a custom intent

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,279
and when i do that i create sample

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,920
utterances and this is what

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,480
uh alexa does behind the scenes to

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,959
really

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
develop the model and determine what

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,519
people say

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,800
with the different ways that they say it

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,000
so last change in air filter

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,959
i can say when did i last change

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,959
my air filter

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:52,399
last change my last

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:56,720
change um

00:15:52,399 --> 00:16:00,160
should i change okay

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,959
and at that point we've got an intent

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:09,279
so we're gonna hit save and then we're

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:10,800
gonna hit build

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,920
okay and then what i'm going to do up

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,560
here is i'm going to grab the project id

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,160
and head back over to jovo so i grab the

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,160
project id or the skill id

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,440
and i uh head over to

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,000
uh jovo so what i'm gonna do right now

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,920
is show you how the jovo project

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
interacts with the platform

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,360
and so right here i've got this empty

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,040
platforms folder

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,639
hopefully everybody can see that and

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,519
what i'm going to do is i'm going to use

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,519
jovoget

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:51,519
and i'm going to use dash s for skill id

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:53,680
you can always do help

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,800
just playing a little slower than normal

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,399
there we go

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:02,000
uh so i'm going to do jobo get

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,799
and alexa skill

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,760
and i'm going to do dash s and then i'm

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,880
also i've got an

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,799
ask profile so you can have various

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:18,400
profiles if you're familiar with that

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:21,039
and so i've just got another one

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,520
so before i got this working i got the

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,360
ask

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,520
client installed and i authenticated

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,400
that with amazon and so that's

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,400
an important step

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,160
makes this look so easy when you've got

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,799
it all installed

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,799
previously

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,200
not the hour trying to get the

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,200
environment set up etc

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,960
okay so at this point what i just did

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,360
was i grabbed the platform

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,679
from alexa and if i look at the

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,640
you know hidden folder here i see some

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,320
metadata about my skill id

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,039
and so populated that for me and i also

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,000
grabbed this model so you can see that

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,320
this new intent

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,120
that i created has these samples right

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,799
here

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,200
and so i'll show you the back and forth

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,360
nature of jovo i can go to the ui

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,480
create things there pull it into my jovo

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,679
project or

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,440
i can actually um change the model in

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,360
jovo and push it up to

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,559
alexa and so right there i grab the

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,559
platform

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,760
and if you look at my models folder it's

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,600
completely empty

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,200
so typically what you do is you would

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,799
build from your model and that would

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,600
build a platform and you would deploy

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,240
the platform

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,000
to alexa or google what i'm going to do

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,120
is i'm going to reverse build because i

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,440
i want to grab what was in

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,480
alexa and i find this really helpful

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,200
when you don't know

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,320
or remember how to do the jovo model

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,440
perfectly

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,799
um it uh and

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,720
uh so this is kind of the path that i

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,000
would suggest taking in the beginning

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,080
before you can just write

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,440
the jovo model and push it up to

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,240
platforms

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,760
the um what i'll do now is do a jobo

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,600
you actually just grab the command for

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,840
this

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,840
they do a drovo reverse build

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,440
okay so i'm going to reverse build the

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,840
alexa skill

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,600
and then that will populate my model for

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,400
me here

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,160
okay so now i've got a joeville model

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,240
this is that that abstraction layer that

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,960
i was talking about previously

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,760
and i'll kind of show you how this works

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,679
so

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,080
now that i've got my jovo model what i

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,200
would do is my platforms folder i would

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,480
ignore

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,720
um from the repo similar to like node

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,960
modules okay these would be ignored

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,840
what i would do is i would commit this

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,440
file here

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,880
to my repo and this is what would be

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,480
version controlled

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,640
so if i look here i've got four phrases

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,400
in my intent and these are the four

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,000
phrases that are right here

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,080
it obviously does a lot more than this

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but starting with the basics here

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,039
so if i wanted to add another one

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
um what i can do is

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,280
um say okay so this is last changed air

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,080
filter

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,600
uh let's see here tell me the last

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,559
time these okay and

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,320
i'll hit save so here instead of the

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,840
reverse flag

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,520
hopefully you can all see that so

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:35,840
instead of the reverse flag i'll do that

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,840
and i will build the platform

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,799
and if i look at my interaction model

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,360
i should see those um

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,840
that last one there so now i've got five

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,840
and so now i'm going to do a deploy

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,559
grab the command for this really quick

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,679
so now i'm going to do a jovo deploy and

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,520
then i select the platform alexa skill

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,039
and if i didn't do that it would deploy

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,799
all the platforms i had

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,400
i only have one so it probably doesn't

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,039
matter then i've got my profile there

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,559
just because i have a profile

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,559
so at this point we're going to come

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,000
back over here we've got

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:22,080
four utterances sample utterances

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,080
and we should bump up to five

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,640
so as that does its thing

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,080
there's there's so much that goes into

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,120
these ui

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,520
um fixes so as you're as you're in here

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,320
you're adding utterances uh pretty soon

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,720
we'll get into

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,880
inputs so if they want to say like give

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,240
you a value

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,960
there's other things that's being

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,960
managed in the alexa console

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,559
once you do that you got to go over to

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,559
google and do the same thing

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,960
and go click all the sample utterances

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,640
and add in the same input fields

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,280
and if you're using other platforms

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,799
you'd have to go over there click on it

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,559
enter in your sample utterances you can

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,080
see where this gets very tedious and as

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,440
a developer

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,200
that just can't be so um

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,200
what i'm gonna do now is hit refresh

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,120
so what we've done is we've kind of gone

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:18,640
down the chain and back up the chain

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,640
now what i could do as well

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,400
i think for the sake of time what i will

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,960
do is not demonstrate this

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,720
uh what i could do as well is i delete

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,840
the skill completely

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,919
and then just build from the jovo model

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,280
so i i could i could share a project

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,000
with you that you could

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,080
build from the jovo model and have that

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,640
go right into the platform so that's

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,400
that's the beauty of it so let's let's

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,120
keep on moving here

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,720
so for step one we've gone over the jovo

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,159
clyde that was the key learning and

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,600
we'll speed this up

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,919
quite a bit there's an exponential

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,080
learning curve here as this goes along

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,000
uh in the three steps but i really

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,120
wanted to go over the basics there so if

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,760
you just get that

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,960
from this session like that that's all

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,960
that matters

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,720
uh i guess and maybe just this next part

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,760
because this is where we connected in

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,159
so i'm going to close that

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,760
and i'm going to open up the app file

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,400
now the app file is

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,960
is uh where we're going to do all of our

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,880
logic

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,400
this is where the intent meets our code

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
and we get to do something

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,320
so for this phase we were just wanting

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,240
to say hello

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,520
and so what i'm going to do here is hit

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,360
save

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,400
um we're looking good and i'm going to

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,559
right here i'm going to look at the test

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,159
file we've got our sample test i've

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,400
rearranged what the sample test is a

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,559
little bit just for alexa

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,520
and so what i'm testing for is that on

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,159
launch

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,559
we say hello right here we're using

00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,279
internationalization and in the

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,600
app file we are not so i'm going to run

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,240
npm test and expect to fail and that's

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
okay

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,679
because we'll add internationalization

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,159
on the next step because we want to get

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,240
there

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,760
and also when you run a test you have to

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,279
have the environment running so i'm

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,200
going to do jovo run

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,200
that's another joboclai command

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,760
okay when the j when you run the uh jovo

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,679
it gives you a web hook the web hook is

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,919
right here

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,720
and uh it shows in the console and you

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,120
can also

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,400
find it uh i was gonna say right here

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:38,159
um but uh i guess not the

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,559
um when you when we deployed

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,360
from jovo to our platform it

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,919
automatically

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,520
set this for us so we didn't have to do

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,080
it now it's kind of a nice thing so

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,799
right here

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,559
you can see how it set the the jogo hook

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,799
now that wasn't when i did jovo run that

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,200
was when i did jovo deploy

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,000
that it did that so if it didn't if i

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,559
didn't deploy

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,159
i could copy this i head over to my

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,400
skill i click endpoint

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,919
and i click default region paste and

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,039
then you click the one that says

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,720
subdomain in it

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:11,760
and you're done okay so at this point

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,760
i'm going to go over to

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,760
test

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,600
and i mean i just feel like you gotta

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,080
run at least one test before you deploy

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,919
so

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,240
the running a test there and as we can

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,240
expect we are failing on that match

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,760
but nothing else so it tells us

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,080
something

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,559
the what i'm going to do now is i'm

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:43,840
going to say open air

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:43,840
check filter

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,480
up

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,960
go over here really quick and just hit

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,960
build

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,200
one of the things i have noticed when i

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,120
when i went to test the first time was i

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,480
had to disable antivirus

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,320
um for some reason that was my web

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,120
antivirus shield was having problems

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,880
with this

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,279
so i'm gonna let this build looks like

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,559
the full build was successful

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,559
but then it's still saying it's in

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
progress

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,480
cool that that does happen from time to

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,120
time sometimes i have to go back

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,240
save hit the build model uh not not sure

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,799
what the deal is there

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,440
so i i entered the invocation and what

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:08,559
that did was it hit the launch function

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,360
uh on my in my app here so right here

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,720
hello

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,679
there my name is arie now we did jovo

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,720
run if we do

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,760
watch then it will watch the files of

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,760
what we're doing

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:25,520
so if i say hello there

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,039
you look great hit save i come back up

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:35,840
here

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:35,840
open air check filter

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,720
i think this is uh it's my computer

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,559
being slow now

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,559
what's happening though is everything is

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,600
running off of my local environment here

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,320
so i can see what

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,320
what's happening

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,480
so this was for example is what the

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,000
previous request looked like

00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,240
as it hit my computer via the web hook

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,240
and

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,559
go ahead and hit enter here

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:17,840
i'm going to refresh this

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,760
hello there you look great my name is

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,399
erin

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,279
okay so at this point we've done our

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,559
invocation

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,760
and we have hit our app code

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,360
and um i would love to pause for

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,320
a few questions here but let's get to

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,480
step two see if we can get step three

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,240
and uh and go from there but right now

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,360
we've got a basic hello world where

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,600
we've hit our app

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,960
things that we edit here we can test and

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,240
alexa

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,880
and if you're using the same um profile

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,240
or email

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,840
that you use on your other alexa account

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,039
so you should be able to use it on those

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,520
devices as well

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,200
so pretty cool um so what we're going to

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:13,679
do now

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:19,200
is like warp speed here um so i'm gonna

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:22,880
go ahead and go to step two

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:26,080
so warp speed to step two so step two

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,640
from the read meep was to now

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,919
record when an air filter is changed

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,440
what we're going to learn from this

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,960
is a little bit about states but we're

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,080
also going to learn about uh

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:40,159
data between intents okay so

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,520
start to get interesting so um what we

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,120
can look at here

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,559
is when um and let's also learn about

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,760
intent maps

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,799
so the uh

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,960
what we created previously was uh

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,120
was one single intent that basically

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,320
mapped to a function and it said hello

00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,600
now what we're going to do is we're

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,440
going to say hey alexa i want you to

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,320
remember that i i changed my air filter

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,919
just now

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,360
and it's going to save that date then

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,640
i'm going to say hey like so when was

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,080
the last time i changed my air filter

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,240
and it's going to say you did it three

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,840
months ago

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,360
and so that's basically the gist of what

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,320
we're trying to accomplish

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,360
when it does this it it's going to use a

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,520
couple new intents

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,679
because i'm mapping new things that i'm

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,640
saying to to functionality

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,480
and uh it also is going to use standard

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,360
intents like are you sure

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,080
yes i'm sure or do you want to do that

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,799
nah

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,159
never mind it's going to pick up on yes

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,520
and no intents

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,279
now um what what

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,039
amazon and other providers have is

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,120
they've got these really default

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,799
uh these standardized intents that are

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,399
very common yes and no

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,360
questions are very common so you don't

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,679
have to recreate those as a custom event

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,200
what you can do is just use the default

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,039
system provided

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,080
intent and so if we look at the config

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,480
file here

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,399
we've got this intent map and all this

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,039
does is it takes amazon

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,080
standard intents and google standard

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,039
intents

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,840
uh and so forth and maps them to a

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,760
naming

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,559
that we pick in this case we're going to

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,799
map all amazon yes intents to yes intent

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,000
amazon no intents to no intents and and

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,000
so forth

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,640
the um and i'm actually not sure if you

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
have to map that one but

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,039
yeah i don't think you have to um

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,440
the uh so

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,480
at that point when someone says yes it's

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,200
going to

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,360
go to wherever you say is you know the

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,799
place that yes intent is supposed to be

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,399
you can imagine if you have an app that

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,240
has several yes and no questions this

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,320
starts to get tricky because

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,559
uh if they say yes it can't just go to

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,760
like the same yes function every time

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:53,760
so that's where states can come in

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:57,039
and appear to be useful the

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,360
to use a state we basically just tag

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,799
this

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,679
on before ask in jovo there's two verbs

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,960
we use

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,960
ask and tell when we tell it

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,159
says something to the end user and then

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,840
ends the session

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,320
no more no more mic open it's closed

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,600
ask leaves the mic open for future

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,399
interaction

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,000
so what we're going to do here is we're

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,399
going to

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,440
say hey i want to ask this welcome

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,720
question

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,720
and um and we're using

00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,640
internationalization here i'll show you

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,919
what that looks like and we're going to

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,320
follow up with the

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,440
uh this date right here so when i uh for

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,159
internationalization

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,600
due to time it's basically a file in

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,320
this folder

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,640
and this will just make it easier for us

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,880
to type things because it's all

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,399
typed out for us but that first welcome

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,760
is going to say welcome to arie

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,519
help you remember to change your air

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,799
filter in your home would you like to

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,159
record a change

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,960
so that's going to be the initial

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,960
interaction there

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,200
so coming back to welcome

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,640
it's going to ask that if they say yes i

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,679
would like to record it then it's going

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,440
to go

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,960
to this yes here and that's going to

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,960
immediately forward

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:18,559
to record change air filter intent

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,880
which is going to save a date

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,840
and then it's going to tell the user

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,360
that that was saved and then end the

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,000
session so

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,760
um one of the one of the problems though

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,200
is if you look at this there's all these

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,240
intents

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,399
and if you look at our build here there

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,399
are

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,840
none of those

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,679
there all we have is the last changed

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,039
air filter intent

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:50,159
so warp speed again let's

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,320
go over here to the models

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,559
and because we're on step two branch

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,519
i've added in all of the other intents

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,480
for the rest of the

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,840
uh exercise here and this will all be uh

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,039
live on on the github

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,039
i realize this is very fast in

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,799
this short amount of time and we've got

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,879
about five minutes left before i want to

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,240
open up to questions

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,159
um the uh so basically right here same

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,720
steps as before

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,480
where i'm gonna do jovo build

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,639
okay so that's going to build from my

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:35,440
model to

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:38,079
the platform and now i'm going to deploy

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,679
and all of this these intents that i've

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,040
created will now be

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,040
available in my alexa account

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,720
uh one of the things i'm going to skip

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,240
over is slots

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,440
um or parameters entities basically

00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,640
the ability to um guess or take

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,800
input with that with the interaction um

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,560
i'll leave that to you to do some

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,839
reading on but it's pretty simple as you

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,079
add an intent

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,839
you can um basically specify i'm looking

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,359
for a name i'm looking for a color

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,160
etc and you can see that in the uh jova

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,359
model here with

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,800
inputs so um which it's actually very

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
strange they should not be asking for a

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,240
name here

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,920
but it won't hurt anything because i

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,800
didn't add it up here

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,599
down below you can see like size of air

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,359
filter

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,960
i'm looking for a width and a height and

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,040
and then now you can see my input

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
request here i'm looking for a width by

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,800
height

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,599
and i've got the brackets there to

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,920
denote an input okay so i'm going to go

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,839
back

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,839
over to

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,920
my um alexa skill

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,280
it notice that there's uh utterance

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,680
conflicts

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,880
and um and so if you if you if you click

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,480
on interaction model you can see those

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,400
they're right here basically it's like

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,079
hey you've got like the same utterances

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,640
that are mapping to

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,359
um different intents this is confusing

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,920
me

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,400
so we can go in and modify those it's

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,200
okay

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,320
it'll run it'll run without it as long

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,680
as i

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,680
don't use one of those right now

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,560
so it's building i just want to make

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:30,160
sure it gets built here

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,160
okay and i go over to text

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,200
okay so now the intents are available on

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,599
alexa

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,680
thanks to the jovo model and now what

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,400
we're looking for is we're going to

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,680
ask if they want to record something and

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,680
then it's going to

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,079
come over here to this state and and

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,560
record that

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,560
so let's go ahead and do open air filter

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,079
connection error your jovo web hook

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:09,839
endpoint is not running

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:09,839
please run jovo run that was good

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,920
welcome to arie i hope you remember to

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,320
change your air filters in your home

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:26,480
would you like to record a change

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:29,520
great i have saved that for your records

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,720
okay and um

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,480
so what it did right there was

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,079
part of the jovo framework is the

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,359
ability it

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,000
it will save data to a database of your

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,400
choosing could be dynamodb it could be

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,560
firestore in this case we're using

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,839
filedb which is the flat file

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,480
locally only for development purposes

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,040
and

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,359
so it saved this last change field and

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,480
if i click on my db

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:01,520
and click on this db.json i will see

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:05,760
last changed there and

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:09,119
so now when i come back here

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,119
i'm going to open air filter

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,720
welcome to arie i help you remember to

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,079
change your air filters in your home

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,839
would you like to record a change

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,400
you last changed your air filter a

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,400
minute ago

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,560
so unfortunately we're probably right at

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,880
time when i should i should stop

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,640
the uh we talked about in this one we

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,800
talked about intent maps where you can

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,839
take standard intents and map it to

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,280
similar functions um

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:44,000
and we talked about states and we talked

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,119
talked about saving data in between

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,119
sessions

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,480
as far as the tests go which i kind of

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,960
skipped over there

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,680
you can see some of of what we do to

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,599
test

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,800
part of the jovo framework is a nice

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,160
testing suite

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,760
you can uh test based on platform uh as

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,040
you know so basically if the platform

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,079
has a different experience you can test

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,560
differently

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:10,000
and um so if i run a test here

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,079
should should pass everything and

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,680
um basically what we're doing when we're

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,520
testing we're testing that

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,119
when an intent is called that the

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:21,280
expected speech

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:29,839
or out output is is uh given to the user

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:29,839
so i'm going to go ahead and

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,720
okay i'm gonna advance to step three

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,720
here

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,000
and i'll um basically just

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,400
very quickly go over one concept and

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,079
that

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,920
is we talked about user data um

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,839
with the um the last step here what we

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,680
want to do is we want to ask a user for

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,079
a variety of air filters

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,040
so we've got some you know ephemeral

00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,640
data that if they

00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,240
mess up we want to just kind of go back

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,839
and do it again we don't really want it

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,359
persisting to the database

00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:08,839
so we introduced the concept of that

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:11,119
and i think for the most part it's very

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,000
similar stuff to what we've already

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,240
learned

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,560
so let's just demonstrate this really

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,560
quick

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,480
so now it's going to ask me if i want to

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,160
record welcome to arie that i change

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,680
i hope you remember to change your air

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,920
filters in your home

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,200
would you like to record a change so i'm

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,880
going to say no

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,880
this is not ready yet dope

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:39,839
and um so back up here

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,760
oh okay so when i ran this file i just

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,319
did jovo run i thought i did watch

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,839
so i'll go ahead and do watch just for

00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:55,119
next time if i change the file

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:57,040
um there's a couple gotchas there

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,560
and i'll end here very soon so i can

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,680
answer some questions i am the last

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:07,359
speaker so

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:10,079
i think we can go a few minutes over

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,960
yeah take your time nate no worries okay

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,440
thank you

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,680
welcome to arie i hope you remember to

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,640
change your air filters in your home

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,200
would you like to record a change so i'm

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,560
going to say

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,319
no because i already did that okay

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,640
would you like to add some air filter

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:29,680
sizes to remember for next time

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,599
yeah let's do yeah there we go which

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:36,160
room is the air filter located

00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:37,520
i'm going to say primary bedroom

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,520
what is the width and height of the

00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,640
filter in inches let's say

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,319
30 inches by 40

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,359
inches this filter is in your primary

00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,960
bedroom and is 30 inches by 40 inches

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,640
is that correct here's where i could say

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,040
yes or no um

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,640
if that was correct great would you like

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,160
to add another air filter

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,160
and i think in this step too i was

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,560
trying to demonstrate looping

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,319
and whatnot but i'm going to not teach

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,760
you another one

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,200
and then just really quick here i'm

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,200
going to say open air filter

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,800
welcome to arie i hope you remember to

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,680
change your air filters in your home

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,599
would you like to re looks like you do

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,839
not have any air filters

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,359
would you like to add something well

00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,960
that was a bummer

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,560
yeah it should persist that um

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,480
in any case then it would it would list

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,400
out your air filters

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,240
so with that though i'll go ahead and

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,640
open up for questions i'll post this

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,280
live

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,319
and you'll be able to to demo it and try

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,920
it out

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,760
as you please you know feel free to

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,839
reach out to myself

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,839
let me put my slide up really quick

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,960
feel free to reach out to myself or to

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,839
the jobo folks with any questions that

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,839
you have

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,400
thanks so much nate great presentation

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,160
um

00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,319
first of all there are a lot a few

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,040
people asking if you could please share

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,440
all the links that you used um if you

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,200
don't mind putting those in the chat box

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,000
yeah absolutely yep and if you go to

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,839
jovo.tech the docs are really good

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,440
i've been very very happy with the

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,599
documentation

00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,119
and i would say the caveat here and part

00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,800
of the reason why i didn't go the google

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,599
route is because

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,560
there's a new library that came out that

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,079
they just

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,560
launched google conversations and so um

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,839
pay attention to that as you're

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,319
developing because you'll want to use

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,839
the new library not the old one

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,680
thanks yeah one of the questions here

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,800
was jova will work

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,280
for google assistant as well right it

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,599
will

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,280
yep and it will work on visual displays

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,240
which is a big question a lot of people

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,280
have is

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,599
it it can use the amazon's presentation

00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,319
language the apl

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,880
and it has a really nice interface for

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,400
doing

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,599
visual outputs

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,280
awesome um question here

00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:14,400
can i create a jovo app that i will take

00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:18,240
a request and then pass it on to google

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:23,280
alexa without needing google slash alexa

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:26,800
in active listening mode

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,520
um i mean i think the short answer is

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,599
yes

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,960
uh it's very flexible and you can bring

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,640
your own platform

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,920
to the um to the jovo framework

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,720
so i understand that you should be able

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,240
to

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,720
you know use your own device like if you

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,599
wanted to create like your own um

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,000
hardware to send something over it you

00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,920
could

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,319
use your own uh you know choose your own

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,560
natural language understanding perhaps

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:55,680
you could use like the google's

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:58,800
dialog flow api et cetera

00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,480
something like that to process

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,000
that and then return back to your

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,760
handler in jobo

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,920
nate um anonymous

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,280
attendee is saying thank you do you have

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,720
suggestions for

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,560
tutorials or will this talk be a video

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,200
they could not catch all the commands

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,480
you went through sorry about that

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,119
um the uh so yeah the

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,920
in jovo on the website they've got

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,680
courses

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,000
hello world trivia uh audio

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,400
the podcast one is really good so i

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,119
would go through the courses

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,560
the other item there was another thing

00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,240
where it was like getting started

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:46,160
i found those to be not as helpful as

00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:49,520
the courses on the jovo.tech website

00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,839
nate um next question here from hannah

00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,280
are ask profiles something that is

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,400
unique to jovo

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:59,440
and what are they yeah good question

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,079
the uh ask client

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,359
is amazon alexa's client that runs in

00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,160
the command line

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,520
and so if you're working for various

00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,319
accounts like let's say you're a

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,240
contractor

00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,839
working for various companies you can

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,480
have different profiles

00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,200
to access those various accounts it's

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,720
similar to an aws profile

00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:23,280
or you know um other command lines so

00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,720
it's not specific to jovo but jovo does

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,160
support it so you can

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:33,520
hop in hop in between different uh

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,520
ask or you know alexa console accounts

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,119
thanks nate a lot of positive feedback

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,200
on your presentation here

00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,400
um let me scroll back up all the

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,599
comments

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,880
um is alexa developer console really

00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,079
free

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:54,000
um jen is having an amazon give gave her

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,000
a screen to give payment info

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,040
yeah so the uh it should be free if

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,160
if you if you create a developer account

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,720
i'm not aware that i had to put my

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,160
credit card in or anything like that

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,079
and um when you deploy a skill

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,160
you'll have to deploy it somewhere a

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,440
great place to just to deploy it is to a

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,280
lambda function

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,079
and at that point you'd be paying if you

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,240
got off of the free tier with aws

00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,640
or you know went above and beyond that

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,880
the alexa console itself is completely

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,880
free

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,040
thanks so much nate um

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,720
that's all the questions i'm seeing we

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,359
we still do have a couple minutes if

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,599
anyone has any additional questions

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,559
um thanks for putting your contact

00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,079
information

00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:42,079
nate yeah yeah feel free to reach out if

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,839
you got questions and

00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,480
once you get started it you know you can

00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:50,559
really create all sorts of interesting

00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,800
workflows or you know skills stuff

00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,559
awesome question here from hannah what

00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,559
was the most difficult part

00:47:54,559 --> 00:48:01,680
of creating your first skill

00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,839
um yeah i think that your

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,280
um drove in a lot of ways reminds me of

00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:09,200
terraform and with terraform you're kind

00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,559
of

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,400
you're deploying or creating resources

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,480
and other platforms etc so you're just

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,960
really stressed i guess about the

00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,920
naming convention and getting it wrong

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,599
and

00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,000
it doesn't seem to be a lot of error

00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,440
output as to why you got it wrong you

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,280
just misspelled something

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,520
i guess that's explained coding in

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,599
general but what really was the game

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,480
changer was

00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,920
just going to alexa console building it

00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,920
and pulling it into

00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,960
jovo because now you've got a pristine

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,599
copy

00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,400
and then reverse build that to the jovo

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,319
model

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,920
sometimes i'll screw up my jovo model

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,599
locally so

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,119
if i don't have it version controlled i

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,000
will you know just pull

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,640
a fresh copy in from amazon or from

00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,480
alexa

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,400
or from google assistant just to get

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,280
like a fresh copy because i'm like i

00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:03,839
don't know if i

00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,839
edited this right so

00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,960
thanks nate

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,400
perfect we still have a couple more

00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,520
minutes so if you have questions we'll

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,520
hang on for a few more

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,960
cool i'm going to check here

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,960
i should have saved the list

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,960
so i'm gonna just restart this

00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,200
here's a question eight is the workflow

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,400
similar

00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,400
in jovo regardless of which platform you

00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,400
use

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,440
um yeah i would say the workflow is

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,480
similar

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:56,240
i guess one of the um

00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,760
you know one of the one of the things

00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,720
that

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,839
you know is something that is perhaps

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,119
not as easy as you'd hope for

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,200
you know when you think about it in

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,040
theory and then reality hits

00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,119
is that you do have to know the nuance

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,119
nature between different platforms

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,240
so there's like those little nuanced

00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,640
things between

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,599
platforms that you have to go learning

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,079
there again

00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,280
go to the ui builder for those platforms

00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,880
pull it into jovo

00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,200
build it you know reverse build it and

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,359
then see what that looks like

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,720
for example with amazon you you can

00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,960
actually grab a standardized

00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:36,000
amazon.room input slot

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,160
and it it can identify what a room is

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,040
in google you have to create that you

00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,839
have to

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,119
build what are the things that google

00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,960
should be looking for that are

00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,359
identified as a room

00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,839
and so um yeah that's where the workflow

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:52,000
is different but

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:54,960
i think that as much as possible it

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,520
really keeps the workflow standardized

00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,800
and it reuses as much code as as you

00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,400
possibly can

00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,559
but then there's always that ability to

00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,680
say is alexa skill

00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:08,720
do this is google assistant skill or

00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:11,359
action do that and so it's pretty cool

00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,359
in that regard

00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,200
thanks nate

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,160
so it's gonna let me do this one more

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,200
time here

00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:37,839
oops looks like air filters are tricky

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:37,839
oh man

00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,920
yeah just looking at this in the

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,119
database it stored the air filters right

00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,240
so it stored

00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:21,520
the width height and the

00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:33,839
the different values there it's supposed

00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:33,839
to list them out right here

00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,520
as far as like sharing those links i if
