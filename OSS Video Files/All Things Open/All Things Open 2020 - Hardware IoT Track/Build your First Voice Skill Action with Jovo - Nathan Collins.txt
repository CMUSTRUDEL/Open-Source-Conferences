Abstract: In this session we'll walk through building a voice application using Jovo.  Jovo is an open source JavaScript framework that helps you build cross platform voice applications across Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Samsung Bixby, Twilio Autopilot, Facebook Messenger, and others.  It is the most popular cross platform tool for voice with over 20,000 projects.  Jovo allows you to maintain a single piece of source code and deploy it to many of the most popular voice devices.  We will take a look at the quick development workflow of developing using Jovo, build a sample application together, and discuss some drawbacks you may experience.
