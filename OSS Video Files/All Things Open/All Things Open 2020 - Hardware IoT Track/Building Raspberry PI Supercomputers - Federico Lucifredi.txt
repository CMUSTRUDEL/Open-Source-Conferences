Abstract: Federico discusses what is required to integrate clusters of ARM SBCs, with a focus on Raspberry PI units due to their popularity; the software integration necessary to make them practical, what is necessary to easily configure nodes, and issue commands for system operation; and concludes with how to execute numerical workloads using the MPI interface.

This is a live tutorial with a live cluster, and is meant to be an introduction for those new to Linux clustering.
