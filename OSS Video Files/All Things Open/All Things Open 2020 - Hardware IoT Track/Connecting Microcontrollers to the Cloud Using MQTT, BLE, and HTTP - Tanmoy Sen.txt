Abstract: Connecting microcontroller-based devices to the cloud enables data collection, analysis and remote updates to deployed devices. Often, these devices need to cost-effectively connect to a mobile device for provisioning, reading, and security. This talk describes how to easily program, deploy, secure, connect, and manage small, low-power edge devices with the open source real-time OS, FreeRTOS, using different connectivity protocols. You learn how to authenticate microcontroller devices with iOS and Android devices and to monitor, manage, and update firmware using the over-the-air update functionality.
