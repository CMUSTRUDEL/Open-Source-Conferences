Abstract: A Metric-driven approach to reduce Cognitive Complexity in a code base, using Functional Programming, demoed **hands-on**, by solving a complex real-world ubiquitous design challenge - REST API Bulk Request Validation, with an extensible Framework that separates what-to-do (Validations) from how-to-do (Validation Orchestration). Let's do a case study of a successful implementation done by our team in the world's largest SaaS org, _Salesforce_, through our in-house baked FOSS library **Vader**.
