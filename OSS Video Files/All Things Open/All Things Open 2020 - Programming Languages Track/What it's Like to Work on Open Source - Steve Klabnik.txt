Title: What it's Like to Work on Open Source - Steve Klabnik
Publication date: 2020-12-17
Playlist: All Things Open 2020 - Programming Languages Track
Description: 
	Presented by: Steve Klabnik, Oxide Computer Company
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Programming Languages Track

Abstract: Many people who want to contribute to open source don't know where to get started. In this session, Steve will show you how he does this work, broadcast directly from the setup he does it with! He'll show you how he works on a Rust library that's been downloaded eighteen million times. He'll go over what his development environment looks like, talk about his process, and actually write some real code that will be committed and included in a future release.

	00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,320
this talk

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
is going to be kind of a little uh i

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,080
don't say all over the place as many

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,080
maybe a little wrong but i was thinking

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,519
about you know like

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,359
all things open in general is one of my

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,039
favorite conferences i really love

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,199
going and i've been to many of them over

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,920
the years and now that we're all sort of

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,160
stuck in

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
quarantine you know we're here virtually

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,359
instead of you know whatever physical

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,080
location the conference is at

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,679
and so i was trying to think uh you know

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,320
specifically about what talk i wanted to

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,360
give

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,800
that could be like special in quarantine

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,079
as opposed to just like a talk that i

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,879
would normally give

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,200
but you know is is not so i was thinking

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,360
about it you know we're all sort of like

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
stuck here inside of our homes and so i

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,000
thought it'd be fun to give you sort of

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,160
like a

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,039
this is what working on open source is

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,120
actually like

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,960
because when i do my open source work

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,160
i'm sitting in this chair

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,600
in this room you can see the dog blanket

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,640
on the bed behind me i got a little bit

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,239
of dog hair on my

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,119
on my hoodie because of all that stuff

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,240
like this is like really where it really

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,680
actually happens and so uh i i think

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
that one of the things that uh

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,799
you know i struggled with was knowing

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,600
how to get started

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,880
and like knowing what it is that you do

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,400
and so i thought it would be kind of fun

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,640
to sort of do a general

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,960
like not exactly like a day in the life

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,159
of steve but just to sort of like

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,880
show you actual real world working on

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,280
open source

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,320
shenanigans so uh this is going to be

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,040
kind of like a little

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,560
a little more unfiltered uh sort of

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,159
direct kind of thing

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,079
and uh if you uh if you want to

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
uh you know leave questions in the chat

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,759
or via the q a feature

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,119
i'm going to be trying to pay attention

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,040
to those things

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,560
and so given that it's like about

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000
explaining things

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,520
please feel free to do that and i will

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,040
try to pay attention and pick up

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,320
questions in a reasonably

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,079
fast fashion so

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,680
why am i qualified to talk about this

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,280
topic at all

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,079
basically i got started in open source a

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,759
while ago

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,080
but where i first found success was

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,560
working on the ruby on rails project

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,480
and so i took out a screenshot of the

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
like my first commit ever to ruby on

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,720
rails

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,480
and it turns out that was way back in

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,239
2012. so

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,520
i had i'd done some open source work on

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,200
my own um

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
but uh but it didn't really super work

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,840
out and i think rails is really where i

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,239
found my groove

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,920
and sort of where i became like a known

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,720
kind of like person who works in open

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,879
source and

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,319
does conference talks like these uh and

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,720
so from there

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,480
uh you know today i'm on the core team

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,080
of the rust programming language

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,400
and so i am the number eight committer

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,120
all time you can sort of see over on the

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,360
side there

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,560
we've apparently as i didn't doctor this

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040
for the screenshot but it was kind of

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
fun

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,640
we've had 5500 people contribute to rust

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,480
so far

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,319
exactly 5 500 i don't know why the

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,000
number number is so round

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,360
um but uh you know that was kind of fun

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,760
when i loaded that tab up

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,239
and so this is i have apparently like

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,280
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,000
commits into just the core rust project

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
itself

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
um unrelated to all the other stuff so

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,680
between 2012 and today

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,519
i've done a ton of different work on

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,360
open source um

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,560
i sort of don't do a lot of ruby anymore

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,120
now working on rust

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,319
but uh this is kind of like i want to

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,959
show you like what i've been doing all

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,120
these years

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,879
how that sort of evolved over time and

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,239
kind of like you know what what does a

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,680
person who has contributed

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,040
3 000 things like actually do

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,560
um before we get into that i just want

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,200
to mention that i do work at oxide

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,959
computer

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,480
i was mentioned earlier um we're

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,799
basically building servers

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,239
and we're doing rust um all of our code

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,440
will eventually be open source but it is

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,879
not open source yet

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,480
and we are hiring so if building

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,519
computers is a thing you're into

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,959
you know you should check that out um

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,799
another thing i wanted to say right

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,720
before we actually fully get into it

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,400
is that um there's also been a lot of

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,239
really interesting talk around

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,920
like if contributing to open source is

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,280
right for you and there's definitely

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,400
like a big push for like you should

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,920
contribute to open source

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
i'm definitely like a really big fan of

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,000
that but i should also say it's like

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,280
super okay if you don't want to

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,280
contribute to open source

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,280
there are lots of good reasons to do so

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
like my entire career

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,320
almost every job i've ever gotten every

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,720
professional opportunity

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,239
has all sort of been because i did open

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,680
source work

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,440
however that's not the only way to have

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,520
a successful career and

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,199
for example i've missed out on a lot of

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,000
monetary compensation that i would have

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,000
gotten had i been

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,759
working on a job that paid better

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,840
instead of doing open source work

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,120
so you know not everybody has this sort

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,040
of space to contribute

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,720
and some people will contribute not have

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,479
a good time and decide not to do it and

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,320
that's also super totally fine too

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,840
so if you want to get started in open

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,759
source but you don't know how

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,440
you know you should give it a try if

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,000
it's a thing that you want and maybe you

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,000
will find out

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,840
that it's not for you um but i have a

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,080
bunch of different things that are

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,080
uh that like there's definitely if you

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,919
have the desire and you want to

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
you should be able to find a way to do

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,400
things because there are so many

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,440
different things to do

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,520
and not enough people to do them um so

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,680
uh yeah i want to talk a little bit

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,240
first before we get into some actual

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,280
tasks

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,639
about like what my environment

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,520
and my particular setup looks like

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,880
um programming wise um i just want to

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
make sure i didn't realize i didn't have

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,360
the

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,120
the chat or qa actually up so i'm going

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,479
to pull those up really fast here

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,560
cool so um basically

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,240
uh the first thing i want to say kind of

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,880
almost sort of related

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,440
is that i don't think that it really

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,720
super

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,680
matters what tooling you choose so

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
i'm not saying that like to be the best

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
10x

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,440
open source dev that you need to

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,120
specifically use exactly these tools

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,960
this is not a youtube video with a

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,280
clickbait title

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,960
so you can be successful in open source

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,199
by doing almost everything

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,880
like that you want and being comfortable

00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,759
in your setup is more important than the

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,600
right setup

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
and one of the reasons why i wanted to

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,479
show you my setup is there's actually

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,759
several things about it that i'm not

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,759
super happy with yet

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,759
and so i want to like talk about that as

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,520
well so this is very much a like

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
you know be honest and forthcoming kind

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,800
of situation um

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,160
so here is like the quick overview of

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,240
the tools that i use most of the time

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
this is sometimes called a nascar slide

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,160
because there's like so many logos it

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,120
like looks like a nascar car

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
but these are all tools that i uh thanks

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
tony

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,759
these are all tools that i use on a

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,360
regular basis for different things

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,720
and some of them are because i'm like in

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,600
the middle of transitioning to other

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,479
tools and

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,960
some of them are for all different

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,560
reasons so some of this will be the same

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,039
no matter what open source that you work

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,720
on

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,160
many of these are specific to my

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,080
specific work and rust

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,759
and so you'll find that's kind of true

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,759
as well

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,360
and it also can can be a little more

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,120
broader than that so let's get a little

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,000
bit more specific

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,360
i'm actually going to stop sharing my

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,560
screen and share my whole screen

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,599
instead because i won't show you

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,280
the actual things instead of just purely

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,039
uh screen

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,479
okay so i want to show you the whole

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,520
thing and not just particularly this

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,960
setup so

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,160
um the first thing that we have

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,520
is visual studio code and so we're going

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,080
to look at this code base a little bit

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,680
later

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,680
but i have basically switched to visual

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,000
studio code for almost all of my

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,039
like text editing or editing needs in

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,680
general

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,800
and um it's because i found it to be

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,440
sort of like

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,960
one of the like most lightweight but

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,960
also featureful things

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,880
there's sort of this traditional battle

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,720
between like are you the kind of person

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,639
that has a text editor or are you the

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,879
person that uses an ide

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,840
and for me vs code is like in the

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,479
comfortable middle

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,759
so for when i started off i was very

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,280
much an ide person

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,960
and i went into a phase where i like

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
only use text editors and then

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
eventually i

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,720
started using all these features that

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,639
people were talking about that i was

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
missing in my stock setup

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,840
and decided to sort of like switch over

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,440
and so um

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,919
i find that vs code is like a really

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,360
nice combo of it's very lightweight and

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,319
cross-platform

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,639
which is another thing we'll talk about

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
in a second but it also you know gives

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,319
me the ability to

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,960
do as much fancy or as little fancy as i

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,960
want

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:24,720
so um another part of that

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,360
is that uh vim so i have vim on this

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,639
slide

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,840
i actually uh do uh use

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,440
vim itself still sometimes primarily

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,200
uh one of the things that i have not

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,000
good at with vs code yet

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,159
is there is a very cool uh features in

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,719
vs code where you can do git

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,440
commit shenanigans so there's all this

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,800
like

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,839
doing git stuff i don't know how to use

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,160
this yet honestly

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,160
i learned git from the command line and

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,200
so uh

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,519
if i do a git commit in my terminal i

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,959
get

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,920
vim uh here and i just use that for

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,480
commit messages

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,320
so i still am like a big fan of vim even

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,279
if i use vs code for most things

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,120
and in fact there specifically is an

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,160
extension i have a number of extensions

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,360
installed in code

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,399
i'm going to talk about some of them but

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,440
i'm not going to go through all of them

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,399
because i think that would be a little

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,519
too deep on it

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,360
but i found specifically for me that i

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,000
didn't want to leave vim because the vim

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
keybinding

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,279
stuff is like stuck in my brain because

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,920
i've been using vim for like 20 years

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,959
now

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,600
um but the vs code extension while not

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,120
perfect

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,880
gives me most of the things that i love

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
about vim with all the things i love

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,600
about vs code so

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
super big shout out to the people who

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,920
work on the vim extension

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,440
because uh i definitely like think that

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,920
it's it's super good

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,200
and uh and i really like it in general

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,680
um

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,720
so that's like number one thing i don't

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,000
think that you like have to

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,360
my audio okay it's back um i'll actually

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
talk about that in a second too

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,000
uh i don't think that you need to be a

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,560
vim or emacs person to be successful

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,560
um so don't you like don't spend time on

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,000
learning vm or emacs unless you want to

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,000
i do think those two things are really

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,959
useful and i put in the time so i still

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
do use them

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,040
but uh it's like not that big of a deal

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,880
honestly you're editing text

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,880
it's like it's fine almost no matter

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,480
what you choose

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,320
another thing you will see over here

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,000
that this is uh chrome

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,760
um i'm currently using chrome is mobile

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
browser i like chrome i used to work at

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,320
mozilla

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,040
i love firefox too my previous job

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,640
used uh google hangouts for work which

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,680
only really worked in chrome at the time

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,880
and so i had to switch

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,040
from uh firefox to chrome and so

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,160
i'm using chrome now out of habit um but

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,760
i do like

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,279
generally like to think that you know

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,680
using web browsers is good and different

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,240
ones

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,760
i use firefox on my phone for example

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
another unrelated part of open source

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,760
drinking water

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,959
it's important to stay hydrated

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,360
other thing about my setup i have two

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,040
terminal logos here one is the windows

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,399
terminal which is brand new and another

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,399
one is like powershell

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,160
and new shell which are like actual

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,959
shells inside of the terminal editor

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,720
so i use both like the windows terminal

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,640
as well as the terminals built into vs

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,320
code for all my terminaling needs

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,000
and i've switched to new shell which is

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,240
like a fun shell for

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,760
uh my general shell but sometimes i

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,480
switch back into powershell because

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
honestly

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,680
i've not learned new shell as well as

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,200
that i would like prefer yet

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,720
and so i go back and forth between what

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
i know and what's new and so i think

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,440
this is also important we talk about

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,399
developer tooling

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,839
it's like important to you know if

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,200
you're learning a new thing don't worry

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,920
about also using your old thing at the

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,120
same time

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,360
and like don't worry about improving

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,279
everything all at once so i was like

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,880
really interested in new shell because i

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,839
think it's like philosophy on life is

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,440
very interesting

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,920
um it's kind of like powershell plus

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,160
plus and so i wanted to give it a try

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,200
so i ended up you know making that into

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
a thing but it's like

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,440
there's some parts about that a little

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,880
broken i'll show you a little more later

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,800
also i didn't explicitly mention it but

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,160
i am fully developing on windows

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,760
in the open source community there's

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,360
been a lot of historic hatred of

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,079
microsoft and i was guilty of that in

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,760
the past

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,440
however i've been using windows full

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,880
time for years now

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
and so if anybody tells you that you

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,120
can't do real development work on

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,639
windows

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,800
you can tell them that they're wrong i

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,720
do actually like embedded development at

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,320
my day job completely in windows

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,240
doing all sorts of low-level rust

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,639
tackery and it's all totally fine and

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,079
great

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,839
so use whatever operating system makes

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,320
you comfortable if that's a mac it's

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,600
great

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,519
it's linux power to you

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,959
but you know like you can be successful

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,880
with whatever setup you want

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,959
um i already talked a little bit about

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,800
git i have these rust and cargo logos up

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,000
here and rust analyzer is the plug-in

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,079
that i use to give me

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,200
super ide like features talk more about

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,560
that later i'm sort of

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,839
i want to move on from this logo slide

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,440
really quickly but the last thing i want

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
to mention is chat platforms

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,399
we're going to talk a little bit more

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,160
about this in just a second but for rust

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,680
work specifically i end up using both

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,120
discord and zulip

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,880
because no one can agree on chat

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,959
platforms you end up using all of them

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,560
so this is kind of like my core tools

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,079
that i use every day

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,680
and one thing that i think is really

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,200
neat and interesting is if you notice

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,560
almost all of these are completely

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,560
cross-platform i don't think there's

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,000
anything that's platform specific here

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,680
i think all of these things that i have

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,720
on the screen work completely across

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,600
any os that's a really nice new trend

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,959
um okay so that's enough background

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,200
history setup

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,959
about all those kinds of things let me

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
briefly check in i got some chat

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,920
messages here

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,040
yeah starshop is starship is built in a

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,040
new shell it's really good

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,800
yes thank you for that tip i did at one

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
point have

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,240
someone mentioned in the comments that

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,880
you can uh set an editor

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,800
variable to do code dash dash weight

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,120
which will use vs code uh

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,040
instead i had set that up at one point

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
but it disappeared for some reason and i

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,800
don't know

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,480
what i did wrong so that's like a that's

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
like a thing i need to fix and honestly

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,959
it's

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
vim anyway both ways so it's totally

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,000
like fine

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,199
um but i appreciate that tip i will have

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,120
to check it out maybe

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,320
i used it in a config and a specific

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,519
project instead of the one in my home

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,240
directory so

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,120
uh thanks thanks for that uh that help

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,399
for sure

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,160
um okay so

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,440
working at open source i think there's a

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
really interesting

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,680
uh kind of like challenge here and that

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,279
is that i think that most people when

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,360
they think about the work

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,880
being done in the open source world they

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,560
think that you write some code

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,160
and then you write some more code and

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,519
then you write even more code

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,760
and you're pretty much all in the code

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,560
all day and there definitely is a lot of

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,040
code writing

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,760
but what i find is that similar to like

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,279
a job

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,279
where in many cases in many companies

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,040
once you like are a programmer for a

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,560
long time eventually you're expected to

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,079
move on into management

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,000
uh what kind of happens in open source

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,360
is when you start projects

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,880
they're all the code because it's just

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
you and there's nothing else to do and

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,440
then you open source it and people start

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,199
using things

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,720
and then they come along and they ask

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,839
questions and they need help and they

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,639
send pull requests

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,079
and you find yourself like one day i was

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,839
just writing tons of code

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,600
and then the next day i like wake up and

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
i'm doing like all project management

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,959
tasks and not

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,800
uh you know actual code writing and i

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,680
think that all of those kinds of work

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,279
are extremely valuable and important and

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
especially as you get involved in larger

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,760
open source projects

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
you'll find that there's a lot more

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,720
opportunity for doing things that are

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,959
not purely the

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,880
writing code side of things and there's

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,240
more need for the other skills

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,639
because many people are involved in open

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,040
source are programmers so to some degree

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
most people can code and code pretty

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,199
well

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,880
but there's a really big lack of

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,399
people with skills in things that are

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,560
not actually the programming

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,399
so for example i wrote down on this

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,160
slide all the things that i tend to do

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,759
in my day to day on open source

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,360
so there is writing code it's still very

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,720
much a thing

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,920
reviewing pull requests we're going to

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,480
review a pull request here in a couple

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,240
minutes

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,160
that's a super big deal and is really

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,759
important especially because

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,040
anyone can send in a pull request but

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,240
only a certain number of people can

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,920
review them so there's

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,440
sort of like more important in some ways

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,880
to review pull requests than it is to

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,639
write the code in the first place

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,560
obviously one cannot exist without the

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,000
other but uh you know there's like work

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,880
that kind of has to be done there

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,800
um having meetings a lot of open sources

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,480
about meetings endless endless meetings

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,920
i spend probably two or three hours a

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,839
week in meetings

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,279
and i know people that do open source

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,480
more full-time that are in meetings even

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,160
more often than that

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,440
and one of the reasons why there's so

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,639
many meetings is there's not a lot of

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,279
people who are very good at running

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,880
meetings

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,639
and so if you're good at running a

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,160
meeting you'll get called into even more

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,160
meetings to help manage those meetings

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,600
and those meetings are good and useful

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,320
and they're how the real work

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,800
quote-unquote gets done but uh it's

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,639
definitely

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,639
sort of a big a big thing in many

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,040
projects answering questions that people

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,600
have

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,120
um sometimes in people open issues just

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,279
kind of like part of my next topic too

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,800
triaging issues people will not have a

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,320
bug but they'll open a thing and be like

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,720
hey i just had a question you have to

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,560
answer

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,920
their problem if you want people to use

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,959
your projects then that's really

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,839
important and engaging with your

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,279
community

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,360
you know is just as much work as writing

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,480
code in the first place triaging issues

00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,440
we're going to try out some issues in a

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,360
minute but like

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,720
basically uh you know looking at the

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,160
open issues and figuring out is this

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,760
still an issue or not

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,039
and seeing if you have the ability to

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,199
even understand what the issue is about

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,400
all that is really important

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,160
put a small joke in here about getting

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,520
mad on twitter this is the thing that

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,039
happens in open source a lot but just

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,480
engaging socially in your community

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,760
whether you have a project twitter or

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,679
whatever

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,199
or if you're on you know facebook or any

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,079
other sort of medium where you promote

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,319
your project

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,280
you end up being there and interacting

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,600
with other people

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,880
um even more meetings another little

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
joke there and reviewing more pull

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,960
requests

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,720
sometimes it feels like everything is

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,799
meeting simple requests um

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,240
and then finally going to sleep um

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,160
that's the thing that

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,520
actually matters so there's definitely a

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,880
lot of opportunities for all these other

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,600
skills and all these things are super

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,559
useful

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,760
um and we need more and more kinds of

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,640
people and this is one of the things

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,880
that i

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,480
like to sort of say about open source is

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
that you know you may get started by

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,240
writing some code but uh i personally

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,120
find all the non-programming parts of

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,880
doing this work

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,280
to be more fun in some senses than not

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,799
it goes back and forth um my job before

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,160
oxide i was a product manager and

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,600
actually i wrote no code on the job

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,160
because i really like doing that

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,520
but uh now that i out oxide i'm an ic

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,480
again and i only write code and that's

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,400
kind of fun so

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,000
i find that there's like a good balance

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,440
between you know

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,840
what you can do and in different ways

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,400
and places and times

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,840
and that really matters um so yeah

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
finding a project that wants to

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,520
uh you know get uh you know

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,360
the the like the work that you want to

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,320
do and be able to do it is important

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,440
um we had a good question right before

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,919
i'm gonna get to this actually in one

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,960
second

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,600
um so uh how to be an open source

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,679
gardener

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,440
this is a blog post that i wrote about

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,200
my work on ruby on rails

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,880
two years after that initial commit and

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,919
this basically is almost entirely about

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
issue triage

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,840
this is one of the most read things that

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,679
i've ever written

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,840
and it's specifically about what my

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,440
thing used to be whenever i was

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,960
triaging issues for the rails project

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,640
now i got involved in doing that

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,240
so if you're interested in like more

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,799
reading more about this

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,280
that's a blog post you can check out so

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,039
um

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,480
we have a question i'm gonna the next

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,240
part of this talk is gonna be actually

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,039
doing the stuff so we've talked for like

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
20 minutes now

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,320
but i'm going to actually like show you

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,360
some of this work so before we get into

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,640
that really briefly

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
brandon has a question about what are

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,799
the benefits of doing open source

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,919
projects

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,799
i think there's a couple different

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,320
things so they also change over time

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,679
so i first got involved in open source

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,000
because there was a project that i

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,640
didn't

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,400
want to see die and the maintainer quit

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,799
and there was no one left to continue it

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,559
on

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,400
and so i think this is one of the big

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,919
things about open source that's nice

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,679
is that in some ways you're working on a

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,679
thing that's larger than just you

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,799
and that means that your projects can

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,280
like live

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,480
forever in some sense and it also means

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,679
that people can pick them up after

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,200
you're done with them and so i think

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,480
that's a really big benefit a lot of

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,000
people get involved in open source

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,559
because they feel some sort of sense of

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,080
like

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,200
contributing to

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,320
they get some sort of sense of like

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,520
contributing to culture at large or like

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,000
the world or like

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,280
other you know people or like you know

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,320
the fact that like there's that

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,799
weird github sealed in the arctic vault

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,559
of all

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,320
programming like code i wrote is going

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,200
to be around for like 2000 years or

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,799
whatever now

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,159
and that's kind of like good and bad i

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,640
don't know i've complicated feelings

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,799
about it

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,159
but i definitely like for me like the

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,440
idea of building a legacy

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,440
like i could be part of something that

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,039
will live longer than me is a big kind

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,880
of interesting part of open source

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,360
another one honestly is it's a great way

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,840
to get jobs

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,840
i when i do interview for jobs i still

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,440
obviously interview interview for jobs

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,320
but there are many jobs where people

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,080
have sort of like i'm able to say like

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,960
you've already seen the way that i work

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,320
in public

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,760
and so there's like less pressure on the

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,799
live coding aspect of a job like um

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,480
you know there's still some people that

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,159
want to see that kind of work done but

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,799
you can sort of say like if you want to

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,640
know

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,400
how it is that i work you can go

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,240
literally see me work in public

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,320
and you kind of have this like automatic

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,280
resume um and so i think that's a really

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,159
big benefit

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,000
um and and you know in general you know

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,039
becoming more well-known and doing more

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,880
things in public

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,240
means that you can uh have more

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,600
opportunities for other

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,679
things so um you know that's like

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,640
what matters i really love the job that

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,400
i have currently

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,480
and a big reason that i kind of got that

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
job is knowing people in open source

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,440
and so when they had an opportunity they

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,799
thought of me because they knew that the

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,000
stuff that i like to work on was the

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,280
stuff they were working on

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,280
and the only reason they knew that is

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,280
because we had made connections in the

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,799
open source world in the first place and

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,240
also you know that they're using a

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,280
technology that i'm involved in and all

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,440
that kind of stuff so

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,200
there's tons of people who uh you know

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,240
get jobs because they start on a project

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,840
they really love

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
company wants to sponsor that project

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,679
and then they get a job to work on it

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,520
full-time

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,600
so that's like definitely a big thing

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,480
too so i hope that uh answered your

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,559
question brandon

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,559
um appreciate it i'm just gonna hit

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,039
hope that answers click send um okay

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,240
last one before we really get into it uh

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,280
and then i'm gonna close these questions

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,760
we're gonna get in actually doing some

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,240
stuff

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,200
um an anonymous attendee asks do most

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,880
people who do open source have a

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,480
full-time day job or do people do open

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,400
source full-time and how feasible is to

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,880
contribute while doing a day job

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,559
this is a super super hot topic and is

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,440
very important i appreciate you asking

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,480
this

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,799
i've done both and honestly it is a very

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,000
big

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,400
challenge to contribute uh

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,200
part time when you have a day job um and

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,559
that's a big

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,240
challenge in getting people involved in

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,679
general because i think that part of the

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,280
reason why we've seen

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,880
uh you know not as many people get

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,640
involved is because it's really hard

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,559
like i like to joke that you know if

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,039
your job is doing construction

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,480
uh nobody asks if you like jackhammer or

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,000
something on the weekend

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,200
like it's just assumed that you do the

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
thing as part of your job and not

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,000
outside of it

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,200
um honestly my own contributions to open

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
source have gone down a little bit

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,200
during the pandemic

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,880
because i am just too stressed out all

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,640
the time and i would rather play video

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,720
games than do extra stuff

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,320
after work um obviously that's not

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,000
nothing but i used to be much more

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,640
productive pre pandemic

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,320
doing my open source work as not a job

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,080
so i definitely think that that's

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,600
that's a thing i do know there are many

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,200
times where i was like i'm sick of video

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,960
games i'm doing open source only for fun

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,919
and that would be my like friday night

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,679
um so it just really sort of depends um

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,880
but i do think the intersection there

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,720
is a big thing that the open source

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,799
community has to grapple with and

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,320
uh is like part of the future of all

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,840
this um

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,520
cool i'm gonna get some more questions

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,400
at the end but i wanna actually show you

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,559
the work

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,400
um so let's talk about some actual

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,600
things so let's do it i have a couple

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,640
different things up here

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,919
um some examples of real work we've got

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,039
about 20 minutes left so i'm not gonna

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,480
get through all these so i'm gonna try

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,720
to pick some interesting sort of ones

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,320
and show you like what i really do so

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,400
taking a look at a bug answering

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,840
questions on forums triaging issues

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,120
merging a pull request and start on

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,000
building a new feature

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,799
all various things that i have um so

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,880
let's do

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,000
a couple of the simpler ones and then

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,200
we're going to do a

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,360
merger pull request i think so this is a

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,080
bug somebody opened 17 days ago on the

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,600
rust book

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,760
so i authored a book on rust and

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,039
basically like they opened this bug and

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,559
left a comment so

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,159
they said like hey um in chapter seven

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,000
you talk about how sub modules can be

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,880
made into files but

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
there's this naming scheme issue and uh

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,240
you know you don't discuss

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,080
one of the two styles of naming schemes

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,240
and they mentioned that

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,679
one of the schemes later in chapter 11

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,159
and so this seems bad

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,960
and so i had left a comment a little

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,240
while ago

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,760
that was like uh we actually that's one

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,279
of those styles is not mentioned at all

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,000
so we shouldn't mention it in chapter

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,000
11.

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,440
so uh we probably should fix chapter 11

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,320
to not include it so i'm going to leave

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,159
this bug open

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,080
so that we can track that so i think

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,080
this is one really interesting aspect of

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,600
bugs like people will file issues

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,120
and then you kind of have to like take

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
their feedback and decide

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,720
is this a bug is it not a bug is it a

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,600
related bug

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,960
like what's going on um so someone asked

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,919
me a question and i answered and they

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,159
gave me a thumbs up

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,840
so let's go look and see what chapter 11

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,240
and how it talks about this feature

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,200
um and see how that works so this is the

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
rust book

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
um we have chapter 11. they mentioned

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,799
that like

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,120
when talking about test organization in

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,440
chapter 11 we

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,559
mess up so there's a section called test

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,080
organization

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,679
and the thing they were talking about is

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,080
mod.rs so

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,559
i'm going to search for mod.rs and here

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,000
we have some paragraphs here so

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,279
to avoid having common in the test

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,760
output instead of creating it we'll

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,640
create

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,840
test common mod.rs this is an alternate

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,799
naming convention that rust also

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,720
understands

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,360
so it happens that this is a good bug

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,120
for me to pick

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,720
because it's pretty easy for me to pick

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,760
this up almost immediately because

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,200
this is like my life's work basically

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,000
so no worries if you're finding it a

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,360
little hard to follow this specific bug

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,640
what's happened here is that in rust

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,400
we had a way to do things with the

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,480
module system and then

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,000
we released a new way and we said hey

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,400
that old way is not as good

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,200
so you shouldn't recommend it anymore so

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,799
we started recommending only the new way

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,640
however this is a weird rough edge case

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,240
where the old way has to be used which

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,400
is why i said this is an alternate

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,520
aiming convention that rust understands

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,039
so what i thought was actually the bug

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,960
now that i've investigated this slightly

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,880
more is not actually

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,640
true so i thought oh we should remove

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,600
this entirely but we actually

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,880
can't because this is a situation where

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,480
you need to use the old way

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,000
so i'm not going to actually merge code

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,360
to fix this bug right now because it

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,480
would take too long we'll have 10

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,960
minutes and honestly it'd be really

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,120
boring

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,880
15 minutes a little over 15 minutes i'd

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,400
rather show you some other stuff instead

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,919
but this is a thing that i think is

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,360
really important and helpful

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,360
when you're working on open source stuff

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,760
so i do want to do and show you this

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,120
is i looked into something i've learned

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,080
a thing so now i'm going to leave a

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,520
comment

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,440
saying what i've learned so that when i

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,799
come back to this sometime in the future

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,480
i understand what was going on so

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:06,400
i'm just going to type out a really

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:09,760
quick comment here

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,760
you can see how bad i am at typing

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,840
why is it not actually doing the spell

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,840
check oh no reviewed there we go

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,840
i'm going to leave a comment saying oh i

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,120
reviewed chapter 11. this is the

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
sentence about how we have to use the

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,960
old style

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,399
i don't know how i want to fix this

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,520
right now so i'm just going to leave a

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,960
comment saying

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,799
you know hey this is the way that this

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,360
is so now when i come back to this issue

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,279
later

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,039
i can like understand what's going on

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,520
this is honestly like a big part of open

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,279
source

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,640
and like finishing and triaging issues

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,240
is like knowing

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,159
you know okay what's the current state

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,399
of the world and how is that sort of

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,399
stuff going so that's like an example of

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,679
a bug that was filed in an actual

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,960
library that i have

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,080
um and so that's like a thing um

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,679
okay i want to show you my actual

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
development environment and in browser

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,159
stuff

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,000
it's kind of funny because like you know

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,760
a lot of the environmental stuff like

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,760
you end up using a web browser and using

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,960
github far more often or at least me

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,240
when i'm doing this other kind of work

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,159
than the actual coding stuff

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,600
but i'll show you some stuff in the code

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,559
itself so we're going to do this

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,640
merge a pull request so i have this

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,520
library called semver parser

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,760
i don't know if you know anything about

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,279
the semantic versioning spec or not but

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,240
it's used for dependencies in a lot of

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,480
ecosystems

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,480
and so uh you know this is like a

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,640
specification for how libraries work

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,440
and so i have this parser for the

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,919
library this is the rust package manager

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,799
and i have this library it has it's used

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,840
by rust itself to do version management

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,600
and so it has 15 million downloads all

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,360
time so this is like a library that's

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,080
pretty much used by a lot of people

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,520
even though my docs are kind of bad um

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,440
and some other things

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,720
so i got this pull request the other day

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,640
and actually there's a new comment i

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,600
haven't read on it yet so that'll be fun

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,000
but when i released this version it made

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,480
compiling the version a lot slower

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,919
and so what happened was is hilariously

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,200
enough remember i mentioned that rust

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,200
analyzer extension

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,240
that i use in my development environment

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,320
it turns out that

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,440
the author of that extension uses it in

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,440
a different capacity

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,960
and to open the pull request saying hey

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,120
i want to improve your compile times and

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,080
your number of dependencies by replacing

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,840
this macro with code generated instead

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,679
and so this is i think a great example

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,320
of how open source kind of like works

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,240
in like this is like the unglamorous

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,640
nitty-gritty aspect of open source

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,760
is you know it's not my day job to work

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,640
on this package

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,919
um but it is used by millions of people

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,200
which goes back to that weird question

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,399
about it not a weird question but the

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,039
question that we don't have the answer

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,919
to

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,279
about day job stuff like it's not my job

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,320
to answer this pull request but still

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,279
i'm kind of stuck in this interesting

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
situation

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,559
where other people who use my work rely

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,520
on it and so

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,399
you know there's some amount of pressure

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,360
to like keep current or whatever

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,000
and so matt clad is like here is this

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,559
thing

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
um and here's this stuff and so there's

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,880
some comments about like

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,480
doing this is a good idea so he also

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,000
specifically called in the person who

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,080
authored

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,600
the library that i'm using that's making

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,880
things slower to say like hey do you

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,360
think this is a good idea

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,799
and he basically says like yes this is a

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,159
supported use case but it's one we

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,360
haven't spent a lot of time on making

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,840
nice and clean

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,919
and so i left a comment so i went and

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,440
looked let's go look at the code in here

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:31,279
so we remove this derive library and we

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,120
turn in this generator library

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,399
so my parser was using this library to

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,000
generate the parser

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:40,960
and it was not it was like pretty slow

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,159
um so instead of actually using that

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,399
like

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,559
at compile time this generates all the

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,279
code this is generated code don't edit

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,159
by hand

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,080
c semver.pest and jen pest.rs pest is

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,480
the name of the library that i was using

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,360
so i saw all this code which is like

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,960
wild and

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,360
complicated and that's because it's

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,679
generated by a program and so i was like

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,799
man this seems kind of like

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,000
bad so i left comments saying i'm really

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,440
sympathetic to the goals here but i

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,720
don't know how to maintain this code

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,640
and that's true like i don't think it's

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,240
a bad idea i just i'm like

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,760
if i have to maintain this generated

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,960
thing like i don't know how stuff was

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,519
generated like i don't know how that

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,240
works

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,240
and so uh matt clad hopefully said like

00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,600
oh you know the only thing i need is

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,720
this particular line um and so

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,320
uh you know i like that's not a big deal

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,760
so that seems totally fine and so

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,399
yesterday i was like i'm gonna try to do

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,840
this today

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,440
i didn't do it yesterday and i was like

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,799
oh this would be a perfect example for

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,279
merging a pull request actually on

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,000
stream so

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,919
what happens here basically is there is

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,240
the only part i need to worry about as

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,600
the

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,760
person doing this maintaining this code

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,120
is basically he wrote a test so this is

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,440
some russ code and a test

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,760
and it says test generated code is fresh

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,720
and basically it tries to parse the

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,000
library

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,200
and uh it spits out the answer and it

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,919
compares

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,679
are is it the same or not and if it's

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,200
not the same then it throws an error so

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,240
this means that i can maintain it in a

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,519
pretty easy way

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,760
because i don't need to worry about

00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,279
regenerating all that code my test suite

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,600
will basically catch the generation for

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,440
me

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,799
so that's really super helpful so what i

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,640
want to do before i merge this is

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,120
actually validate that this does what i

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,799
want

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,240
i have tests here and they did run and

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,120
they passed but i still like to show

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,480
things myself

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,559
so what i'm going to do here is

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,760
there's these uh you know like good

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,440
instructions i

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,200
remember how to do these by hand but i

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,720
also like using the ones on github so if

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,960
you are able to maintain things

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,320
you can go into the project itself and

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,080
copy and paste

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,039
uh these examples and then it will

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,240
grab the examples here so now we have

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,679
that code from

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,880
you know the pull request and it's in

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,919
source generated.s and testgenpestrs

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,840
so i can now run cargo test and see if

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,440
it actually compiles and works

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,120
and it does work on my machine and the

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,039
thing i want to understand is before i

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,159
merge this code is like do i understand

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,440
how this actually

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,480
works so um i'm going to go to

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,880
my uh like the actual code here

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,240
and i'm going to test and see okay this

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,799
is the generated code

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,159
supposedly if i modify this function and

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,559
it doesn't work

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,760
then there's going to be a problem so

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:24,159
let's see what happens

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:27,679
if i uh like delete a random line

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,480
so i deleted a line and then

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,559
i don't know why this is not actually oh

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,919
it's still running a test

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:37,600
that's fun so uh

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,000
it was still running my test somehow so

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,000
this test has taken a really long time

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,919
and that is interesting in and of itself

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,840
so now i have to like think about like

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,519
is this the thing i actually want

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,799
uh you know if this is taking a long

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,559
time in my machine is it going to take a

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,399
long time on other people's machines

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,480
i didn't try this at all until now so i

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,480
had no idea yeah it's complaining about

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,519
has been running for over 60 seconds and

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,039
what's interesting too

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,640
is that there was actually specifically

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,919
a comment about

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,760
um there's a bug filed against rust

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,480
format because it takes a really long

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,599
time

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,879
and uh you can see that it uh it did

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,480
actually end up failing

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,000
so generated code and the reviser is

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,720
outdated updating

00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,480
so it did actually like fix the line

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,359
that i deleted and it removed it so

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,119
that's cool

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,960
it did take a really long time to make

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,839
this happen so that's totally

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,800
you know not ideal but also one cool

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,320
thing that i know

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,800
about uh cargo test is that

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,520
if this one takes a whole long time uh i

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,040
can actually

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,639
well it took a long time because it was

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,119
broken but in the fast case it's still

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,000
fast

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,599
so you kind of have to make this

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,200
judgment call of like is this the thing

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,720
i actually want versus not

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,240
and that's where a lot of the art is in

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,599
maintaining something in open source so

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,280
you don't have to take a pull request

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,359
just because somebody asked for it

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,639
however i really know and like the

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,159
author of this pull request

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,440
they did a lot of work to make sure that

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,480
it would be easy for me to maintain

00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,240
these changes

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,839
i also really care about compile times

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,160
this is something my users care about

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,000
so i think this is a great change so i'm

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,599
going i'm going to merge this

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,040
because i've validated that on my

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,760
machine i can make sure that i'm able to

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,200
maintain it

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,040
i know what's going on and that was my

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,920
big question that i had previously

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,880
so i like to merge in the github

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,480
interface

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,240
sometimes i will do it manually on the

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,200
command line but uh it's nice to be able

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,320
to just do this

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,320
so i'm going to

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,560
click merge and that's cool and done

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,520
we're gonna check out master again uh

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,240
so here uh because i had changed the

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,760
code that was generated it complained

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,440
git was like you can't check out master

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,720
because your files would be there so i

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,599
want to blow away those changes because

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,200
they didn't matter

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,119
so the way that i do that personally is

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,079
to do git add dot and then get reset

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,839
dash dash hard

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,280
and i will just wipe away all my changes

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,160
um there's like five different ways you

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,760
can do this in git

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,560
this is the one i've memorized so it's

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,960
the one that i tend to use

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,800
so we're gonna go and check out master

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,400
and uh

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,839
we're gonna go fetch our origin to make

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,119
sure that we have the right thing we

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:08,880
have our new commit

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,880
so we're going to uh

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,480
we're going to change our code to be the

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,000
same thing

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,920
that we had from the origins now this is

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,480
here so that's totally cool

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,200
um so i want to release this change to

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,839
the world as a 0.10.1

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,839
so i'm going to update the version and

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,640
commit my version change

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,400
push my comment back up to master and

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,680
then the way that you publish this

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,520
on the package registry is cargo publish

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,520
so this is going to make this happen and

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,760
what's funny is it's actually

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,920
complaining because i don't have

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,960
a description or a license that's very

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,400
interesting given that i've published

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,359
this tons of time before and something

00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,800
hasn't changed

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,880
so i'm gonna have to figure out what

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,960
that bug is i don't wanna waste my last

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,440
like five minutes doing that on screen

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,920
but um i hope that like generally gives

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,359
you kind of a taste about the way that

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,480
stuff sort of works um i uh

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,520
yeah so uh one fun thing i wanted to

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,839
show briefly

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,079
uh about i actually have this other vs

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,839
code instance running

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,000
this is another version of this code

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,359
that's happening so i'll often like in

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,839
that case i was using the terminal over

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,839
there

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,000
but it's often case that i will use my

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,359
terminal nvs code over here

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,040
and actually just have it all in one

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,720
window so that's kind of cool

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,560
um but i wanted to show you one thing

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,839
that's like kind of about my setup that

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,440
doesn't work right now that i'm kind of

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,960
annoyed with that i need to fix

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,400
so i mentioned i like to use new shell

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,880
because it's a new kind of interesting

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,480
thing

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,320
but i haven't actually fixed one bug

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,560
which is kind of fun so

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,000
rust analyzer my tooling that i have in

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,240
here will actually give me a click on

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,520
to run test so i can click on it but

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,280
there's this funny thing where i didn't

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,599
configure it right so it tries to

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,680
it tries to run the test and fails

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,839
because i didn't configure

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,599
vs code to properly send the right

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,760
command to new shell

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,880
so you know your dev setup is always

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,640
work in progress

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,320
and just like making small changes will

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,680
like make things you know work over time

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,160
so anyway that is uh that's that series

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,599
of things

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,760
i have some chat messages another

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,320
question answer so i want to double

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,839
check

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,359
uh you know some of those things since

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,920
we've got about five minutes left

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,720
um so i want to talk about that a little

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,119
bit

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,720
so uh how do you find one being

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,760
available to maintain or enhance

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,599
this is a really good question um i've

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,040
seen a lot of people

00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,640
say they want to get involved with open

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,320
source and they just want to work on

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,200
anything and i was tr this was true for

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,880
me as well

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,320
but what i found is that you have to

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,400
have some sort of

00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,480
motivation inside of you other than a

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,560
generic contribute to open source

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,079
so for me what happened was i used ruby

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,960
on rails and i really loved ruby on

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,720
rails

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,320
and i wanted to make it better and i

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,839
knew it was already open source so i

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,160
decided to get involved there

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,200
and look through the issues and figure

00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,960
out you know

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,280
what might be available um so

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,720
i'll actually i'll show you my triage

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,000
workflow while we're talking about this

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,680
we have five minutes anyway

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,480
so basically what ended up happening is

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,560
is many projects have started adopting

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,160
labels for this so for example on the

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,320
rust repository if you go to our issues

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,359
we have 5 000 open issues so there's

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,320
6005 even 5k plus is actually 6k

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,599
plus that's a fun github bug um get it

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,240
was open source i could report that bug

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,440
to them

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,480
but um so

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,839
rust has these this tag called e easy

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,320
and this is specifically a

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,160
bunch of bugs that are supposed to be

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,240
easier than other ones to fix

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,520
so we have people who go through and

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,760
triage these bugs and

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,720
put these tags on issues and so these

00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,200
are ones that

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,240
people find to be not super hard so i

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,839
would look through one of these and see

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,480
if any of them catches my eye so for

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,079
example

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,000
fixing some style issues and shell

00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,599
scripts with shell check

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,200
a style issue is gonna be much easier

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,040
than implement a new language feature in

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,079
the compiler for example so what i would

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,160
tend to do is be like

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,359
i look at this list of things and go oh

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,040
that sounds easy to me

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,960
so then i would click on this particular

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,240
issue and i'll go through and it says

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
there's some style issues and shell

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,280
scripts

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,000
shell check is a useful tool you could

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,880
run git ls file star.sh to find all your

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,960
shell scripts

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,000
pipe the result into xorg shell check

00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,119
and then fix it

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,720
you know or fix it file by file um and

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,760
so you know that's like an example of

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,599
how to fix this bug

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,880
so somebody is already kind of working

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,240
on this which is kind of neat so they

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,920
said hey can i try this

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,680
and then somebody said you know hey you

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,200
know cool please do

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,480
there's some issues so let's talk about

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,280
it so then they said like i have a

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,560
question

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,079
and then people answer their question

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,119
and so this is kind of how i get

00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,720
involved in like

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,640
what is available is you pick something

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,400
that you know and love because like if i

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,240
give you a library you don't use or care

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,920
about and say do this work now

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,079
like you're not going to want to do it

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,440
because it's not interesting to you

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,160
so you got to find something that you

00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,000
use almost all software is buggy and

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,920
and like doesn't work properly in some

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,680
way so you can definitely find

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,200
something and then try to get involved

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,319
there and if it doesn't work out you can

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,599
move on um

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,960
you know i uh eventually decided to move

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,160
on for a movie and start working on rust

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,200
and i stopped working on rails and that

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,560
was totally fine

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,160
and you know uh there's been some

00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,520
projects i've contributed to in the past

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,079
where i was like you know

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,839
i took it took six weeks for a pr to be

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,280
merged and that's too slow for me

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,359
so i'm gonna move on to something else

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,480
um

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,640
and one of the nice things about open

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,480
source is that you can do whatever you

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,280
want and that includes not doing things

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,319
so uh you know it's it's like you can

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,520
give stuff a try

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,839
and it's just like not the end of the

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,960
world um if you decide that you

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,400
uh you know want to do something

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,880
different or you don't like what's going

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,119
on

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,680
so i hope that helps answer your

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,480
question um

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,680
so uh some other questions since i have

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,440
like three minutes left

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,359
um basically all i have left is just a

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,160
like thank you slide so let's let's

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,440
answer a couple more

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,680
last questions here in the last couple

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,760
minutes um yeah

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,040
so this is an interesting question about

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,160
so the workflow sounds like basically

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,880
the same as a commercial developer

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,319
workflow

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,920
there's more meetings in red tape and

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,240
open source i definitely think that's

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,280
true in some sense but i think that like

00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,319
this has happened because as open source

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,560
has grown

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,960
like open source in many ways pioneered

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,480
a lot of features that commercial

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,440
usage now like has adopted so like for

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,400
example

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,920
i personally saw continuous integration

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,440
happening in open source

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,440
first and then in commercial

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,079
organizations later i don't know if

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,240
that's true

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,520
globally and i imagine the very very

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,319
first people to do it

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,119
were people in a company maybe but like

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,560
for me

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,240
companies have learned from this open

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,760
source workflow and as

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,359
they've like uh you know further their

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,200
objectives or whatever

00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,960
they move towards an open source flow

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,680
and part of the reason for that is

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,640
opens i think too open source is kind of

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,440
inherently

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,000
a way to contribute across like time

00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,160
zones

00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,920
and cultures and a lot of times you fail

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,599
like it's not great at that but it's

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,240
better at it than other ways

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,040
and so as your company grows you end up

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,960
having multiple

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,400
offices you end up having people all

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,000
over the world

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,160
and so the workflows that worked when

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,480
it's like three people in the same room

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,079
don't scale up and since open source is

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,920
kind of international in the first place

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,319
it kind of has to scale up and so we've

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,119
seen this like convergent evolution

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,480
of similar to commercial workflow

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,160
because commercial workflows have

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,680
adopted the open source flow

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,920
um so yeah totally i think that's uh

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,119
definitely a thing um and yeah i

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,319
definitely think they're a

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,480
super symbiotic relationship for sure um

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,000
i don't think that it's like like there

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,839
are some people who do things purely not

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,839
for money and there's no relation

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,400
but these days the biggest open source

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:50,160
projects have to have commercial backing

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,560
um for rust we maintain compiler support

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,599
for something like 40 or 50 platforms

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,359
and it takes like every single commit on

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,560
rust so i'm going to show you real fast

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,960
in these last couple minutes

00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,960
uh

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,480
let's look at a pull request here this

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:12,720
is one that failed

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,200
so uh each of these like this is not a

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,680
full

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,720
actual run but we run nine different

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,200
builds on

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,800
those ones and we run something like 40

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,960
or 50 builds total

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,839
and all that takes a lot of cpu time and

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,000
a lot of money

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,760
and so like we even though rust is a

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,400
purely open source doesn't sell anything

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,079
project

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,079
we need commercial support to be able to

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,400
pay for our hosting costs and servers

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,800
and

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,680
all that other kind of stuff so i am at

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,720
my time

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,920
so uh thank you so much for being here

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,440
john i'm sorry i didn't get time to get

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,560
to your question and anybody else who's

00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,440
still down here

00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,640
um but i'm super happy to like you know

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,800
if you send me an email

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,319
i'm happy to answer follow-up questions

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,839
and kind of like work on that

00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,680
but um yeah i hope this was like an

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,800
instructive view into sort of like the

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,839
day of the life of

00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,400
what i do um and uh yeah thank you so

00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:04,240
much for

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:06,319
thanks so much for coming

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,319
