uh our technology uh and how we're we're

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,280
driving forward so so first and foremost

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,680
i'll tell you just a little bit more

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,400
about myself i'm a software guy

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,159
i built you know a lot of software back

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
back in the day i spent a considerable

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,680
amount of time

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,799
at ibm and then subsequently uh at

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,400
citrix

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,720
um and you know during that time really

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,040
was just very much uh you know software

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,960
centric enterprise grade software

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
um and you know spent a considerable

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,200
amount of time kind of

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,640
um you know refining my skills there and

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,280
so the question is

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,079
what in the world am i doing selling

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,799
auto parts

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,320
uh and that would be uh uh you know

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,040
hopefully by the end of this discussion

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,399
you'll

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,399
you'll get a sense as to what really

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,360
we're doing to give you just a

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,360
perspective

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,880
uh advanced auto parts is obviously a

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,119
retailer so we're number 313

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,200
fluctuates every year or so in the

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,759
fortune 500 list

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,759
we are headquartered out of raleigh

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,119
north carolina where i'm i'm sitting

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,719
right now i'm not in our headquarter

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,840
building because obviously

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,360
covid but but we've moved our

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,800
headquarters here fairly recently a

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
couple years ago

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,319
um think of it this way 5000 or so

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,400
stores

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,840
uh you know nationwide most of our

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,080
presence is really in

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,400
uh in the united states and canada we

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
have several sub brands maybe uh stores

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,120
that you've seen either on

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,080
uh in your town or or other uh

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
you know parts of the country um car

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
quest is fairly well known of course

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,800
advanced auto is well known

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,720
and then some that really serve more of

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,840
our professional customer base

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,560
um uh auto part international world pack

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,239
these are

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,319
perhaps you know trucks or vans that

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,239
you've seen from driving around

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,239
uh we have around the sixth seventh

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,200
largest fleet uh in the country

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,640
for for any company uh so it's a huge uh

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,400
huge fleet

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,519
around 10 billion dollars in uh in sales

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,000
uh and and really just presence both in

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,000
what we call the diy consumer so you and

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,760
i both kind of walking in

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,440
into a store or going to our e-commerce

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,920
website online

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,360
as well as very large professional shops

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,040
all the way down to

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,360
uh you know smaller smaller shops

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,680
our main thing is you know we you know

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
we're a collection of folks that really

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,959
cater towards the motorists cater

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
towards the enthusiasts

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,799
cater towards uh people that really take

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
care of their car and in fact our motto

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
is really about

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,239
care and speed and really driving value

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,879
to our customers whether they be

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,599
the professional garage uh you know shop

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,879
owner

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,799
uh or they be the the diy consumer

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,920
uh it's really about ensuring that we

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,360
give the right part

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,400
uh you know at the right time in the

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,480
right way uh to our customers and

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
of course you can imagine that doing

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,560
that at scale

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,680
can be challenging at times so if you

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,560
look at our

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,480
complex uh set uh you know

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
interconnected set of systems

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,680
that drive our technology there's

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,319
there's there's

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,599
uh you know a vast number of of systems

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,400
that interconnect together

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,519
but we bring the value to our customer

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,159
with a rich set

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,599
of customer facing systems uh that that

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,079
drive the experience

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,919
now as you can imagine being a fortune

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,880
500 large retailer that means we have a

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,280
website

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,040
uh which you can transact on it means we

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,520
have a mobile app which you can transact

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,440
on

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,800
we have a loyalty program called speed

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,400
for speed perks

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,400
we also have the same um discipline

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,919
on our professional side slightly

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,040
different catered towards the more

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,440
professionals so if

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,040
i have a garage i have five bays i'm

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,400
working on cars i'm gonna speak to you

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,360
in a different way than

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,840
if i'm uh you know a teacher that's just

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,880
trying to

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,759
you know get get to work and and need to

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,759
you know do

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,919
find a replacement part so we try to

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,880
really um

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,240
provide best class customer experiences

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,919
to our consumers

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,360
uh depending on you know where they come

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,120
from what they do

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,440
one little known fact is actually that

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,800
we also have a growing set

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,720
of e-services or cloud services that uh

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,320
drive additional value to our consumers

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,639
so whether they mean uh

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,560
really knowing what to do uh from uh

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,919
from a technical perspective in terms of

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,479
how to

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,080
actually perform a job uh how things

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,479
work together etc

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,000
or something as simple as estimating

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,759
driving you know dr

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
job repairs hey i have a repair that i

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,400
need to perform

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
how much is that going to look like and

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,919
so we use ai technologies to help us

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,600
drive that interaction

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,360
and so it really is that kind of

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,440
collective family of capability that

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,639
allows us to deliver the value to our to

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,199
our customers

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,560
now moving forward when you look at the

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,960
the big picture of

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
our systems and how they work together

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,560
you can imagine being a large-scale

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
fortune 500 custom you know

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,160
company with the sixth largest fleet in

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,520
the con in in the uh

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,120
country um as well as five thousand

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,039
stores it can get pretty complex

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,440
right uh and so there's an incredible

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,039
amount of logistics in terms of managing

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,680
our supply chain of dealing with our

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,639
suppliers

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,919
interacting with um you know with our

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,680
with the vendors that

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,199
that supplies and of course there's

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,000
every aspect of

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,080
that typical sort of large-scale retail

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
uh complexity that comes through

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,759
and it's also complicated by something

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that's really um

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,919
really intrinsic in the automotive area

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
which is this notion of the fitment

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,600
problem

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
meaning that in in the automotive retail

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,800
space

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,160
it isn't just that hey i'm selling you

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,160
this product or

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,360
uh you know fitment might be just large

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,039
small extra large

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,400
petite but rather it's a complex web of

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,160
multiple parts and how they fit with um

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,400
with the many vehicles that are on the

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,720
road and in fact in some cases

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,520
some automotive parts fit certain

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,599
vehicles

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,599
in

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,199
another vehicle so it's think of it as a

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,199
sparsely connected graph

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,080
with a large set of parts and a large

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,240
set of

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,440
uh vehicle types so anyway that

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,639
complexity leads to some pretty

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,280
interesting computer science problems

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,479
and

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,560
a lot of things that jd and i get

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,440
excited about now from a worldwide

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,680
perspective

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,720
you know we have a growing presence uh

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,680
while most of our

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,479
our retail um you know business is

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,039
really cornered

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,680
cornerstone in the united states our

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,479
digital presence is actually worldwide

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,400
we have labs in a number of different uh

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,880
areas that help us to deliver

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,720
products that delight our customers

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,639
the next slide really shows a quick

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
picture of some of our team members uh

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,919
we took this at a meeting that we were

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,479
happened to

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,120
happen to have and you can see some of

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,560
the folks here

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,080
actually when you look at some of these

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,759
as i'm looking through the the people

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,120
that were there that day

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,440
many of these folks came from the

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,240
software uh space from the software

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,120
sector

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,599
we have grown now a large uh technology

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
group

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,960
uh with an advanced auto and that's

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,560
something where you know

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,479
lately over the last couple of years

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,599
we've been really honing in

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,720
on evolving our our our engineering

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
space to drive

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,000
a higher discipline as we become

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,800
essentially a technology company

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,319
now in that space of course uh it's it's

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
challenging and doing that in a way

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,280
that's respectful with really what

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,080
moves us what really drives us we have a

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,720
passion to

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,240
really meet our customers on their terms

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,080
we want to give them the capability

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,399
allows them to do what they do

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,159
but at the same time it really is about

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,680
building a large-scale enterprise

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,680
software discipline

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,719
that allows us to bring those products

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,440
faster

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,640
you know slower lower time to market so

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
faster from a

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
a resolution perspective we want to

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,240
drive

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,680
towards better more unique design driven

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,560
user experiences

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,680
we want to innovate using the best tools

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,160
that are available in

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,839
in today's world particularly around of

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,519
course cloud engineering and

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,880
cloud principles and we want to of

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,440
course accelerate

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,720
the features now we have some few basic

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,880
principles that

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,720
we've instituted uh in terms of our

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,839
technology transformation

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,360
um one of those for example is where

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
we're not going to build things that

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,200
someone's already built

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,000
right there's no point in us reinventing

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,560
the wheel

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,720
and whether that will be uh you know a

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,720
software that we can just acquire

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
um there are many cases where where we

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,000
do that and we leverage those existing

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,399
pieces of software

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,680
but lately and now as we've grown our

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,680
staff as we've gotten

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
a broader technology presence in the

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,839
company

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,000
uh we're leveraging open source right uh

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,880
and in leveraging open source so open

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
source not just

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,600
in in terms of using open source but now

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,320
starting to contribute more to open

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
source

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,160
and what we're really talking about

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
today is how we're going to start

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,200
sharing open source or items that we

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
built and of course bringing

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,040
to the open source community and you

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,680
know collectively we view that as

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,959
as a as a progression you know i mean

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,399
quite frankly

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,160
our technology team is still sort of

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,240
fairly new in terms of this you know

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,560
rejuvenation this revival

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
of technology that has occurred now in

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,279
advance of course i'm happy to be a part

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,800
of that

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,160
now just to give you a sampling of the

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,760
types of things that we've been looking

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,640
at of course the very first step in our

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,480
journey was

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,200
let's use right and in cases where

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,800
we want to leverage modern technology

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,959
react for example that we're

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,720
really has now started to hone in as

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,040
kind of our standard for

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,839
uh front-end uh you know for front-end

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,000
development

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
we're using more node.js for some of our

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,920
back-end development

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,640
uh and a collection of tools kafka now

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,880
for

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,360
you know event streaming as we relay all

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,480
these pieces of information now back and

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,560
forth around

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,760
what's happening in our inventory what's

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,399
happening with uh

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,000
with our supply chain how does all that

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,760
transactional data

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,880
flow through the enterprise in a way

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,760
that allows us to scale

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,800
so this is just a sampling um of some of

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,040
the open

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,800
technologies that we use uh we're

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,720
leveraging red hat openshift is really

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,560
our platform as a service and now the

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,320
collection of these tools

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,640
really allow us to know their integral

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,279
part of how we move forward so as i said

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,079
uh you know the bulk of what we're doing

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,680
is

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,440
really building the things that make us

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,720
unique that makes us special we're not

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,320
going to go off and

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,640
you know re-implement or rebuild

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,480
something that that we shouldn't

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,560
but at the same time leveraging what

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,000
exists really is twofold it is really

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,640
one a matter of

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,959
um open source where where it exists and

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,480
where it serves our needs

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,240
and being a participant in that

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,880
community and of course leveraging

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,720
software products from many of our fine

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,480
technology partners that have

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,079
really paved the way for us in terms of

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,639
driving forward

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,040
now we know of course that innovation is

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,800
really closely tied to

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
the open source community you know a lot

00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,680
of the companies that you see and in

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,680
fact many of the

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,320
large-scale retailers that you would

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,880
view as very technology savvy

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,839
uh they tend to have a pretty robust uh

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,320
open source

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,120
um you know open source program and for

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,279
us

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,360
um you know really is no different you

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,959
know what we what we're growing into and

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,920
aspiring to to

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,480
to achieve uh we see those those two

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,560
things

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,079
uh you know fairly harmonious in the

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,240
sense that we want

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,600
our innovators to take advantage of all

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,360
the great work that's happening out in

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,720
the industry we want them to be

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,399
you know have a finger on the pulse in

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
terms of how things are going

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,600
but it isn't enough it's not sufficient

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,399
enough

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,160
for us to just be simply users it is

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,279
also not sufficient for us to be

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,160
contributors

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,040
we want to start to think now how do we

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,360
share

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,639
the components things that we build that

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,720
you know allow us to

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,480
to really foster that level of

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,440
collaboration with the open source

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,639
community and

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,040
um you know enabling us to sort of uh

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,079
you know provide value as we of course

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,000
uh extract

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,440
value and so we we see it as a two-way

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,519
street and that's

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,279
uh what we're driving forward you know

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,600
to doing

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,800
so what we're looking at doing now and

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
what we're what we're really

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,839
announcing today is is just the first of

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,720
our

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,240
um an open project that jg will tell you

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,320
a lot more detail about

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,079
we call our initiative the open source

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,079
garage right so of course

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,600
everything that that that we do is

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,079
themed uh you know towards the

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,760
the automotive space uh and if you've

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,839
picked up a wrench or two then

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,800
uh you'll be familiar with uh a lot of

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,360
these things but

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,320
you know we're really looking to uh to

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,600
drive forward

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,360
in in terms of this this uh sharing and

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,800
uh angle and jg is going to tell you a

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,040
lot more about what we're doing with the

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,320
data in the fastlane project

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,800
but you know you should view this as

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,839
really just um it's a start it's the

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,639
evolution

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,360
of uh how we're we're building software

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,079
and

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,279
uh how we're participating um you know

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,279
in the open source world jg

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,720
you're on mute yeah i was on youtube

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,399
thank you adolfo

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,760
so it's my it's my great pleasure to

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,240
talk to you a little bit about

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,720
um about data in the fast lane as you

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,560
can as you know the theme is about

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,320
all the affirmatives so it made sense

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
that when we're talking about building

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,800
an etl tool

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,240
well it's also based on the on the

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,199
on the automotive theme but it's not

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,360
we we wanted to build something that was

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,880
really easy to use

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,199
where you can do your transformation on

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,320
the fly uh that where

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:40,240
you can scale like crazy and that's

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,079
also why it's backed by apache spark um

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,440
and uh those of you who attend the

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,399
conference know that

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,079
i'm kind of uh talking about spark in a

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,639
few in a few sessions

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,639
so let's let's look a little bit about

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,240
the details first yeah it's open source

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,040
we just added it's our first

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,079
open source product product we're we're

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,279
putting on the market

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,560
um you can you can already go to get a

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,120
github and clone it

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,160
um it's an apache tooth business

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,279
friendly license

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,199
just go and enjoy it it's standalone

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,480
it means that you can use it as a

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,120
standard piece you don't need extra

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,160
software

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,720
it just building it brings all you need

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,639
right away it's easy to use not going to

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
lie there's a small learning curve like

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,720
with every tool

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,199
but past that you're going to enjoy it

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,399
very

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,600
quickly it's fast it's backed by apache

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,000
spark

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,720
it's scalable did i mention that it was

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,920
backed by apache spark

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,639
and it's container ready so you will be

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,040
able to

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,959
just get it and write it in your docker

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,519
container right away

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,040
or open shift uh it's cloud ready it's

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,800
not because it's the containers that

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,680
it's automatically cloud ready

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,199
it it can it allows you to also get data

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,639
from aws

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,519
back and forth using the

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,399
s3 or any other database on the cloud

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
really

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,560
it's scriptable so basically well you

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,279
define your etl

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,320
as a script as a yaml script or it's

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,560
embeddable

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,920
so you mean you can use data and

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,639
fastlane directly

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,120
as an other library that you would embed

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,959
into

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,120
your own applications it's extensible

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,120
that would make kind of sense so it's an

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,240
etl you've got your specific data

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,320
transformation your

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,519
you've got some existing routines you

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,920
can directly build them

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,880
and add them directly to to the tool

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,839
okay

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,279
so um and finally

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,519
um yeah it's source control

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,680
source control is is really important

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,519
right i think we all use source control

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160
well some etls are not ready for source

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,399
control

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,600
here you can use source control for of

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,680
course your scripts

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,560
and you can also use source control for

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,720
zero extensions in a very easily way

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,440
so let's get into a little bit of

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,480
architecture i'm an architect after all

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,800
so basically what you are going to work

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,319
on

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,400
is using a recipe file the recipe file

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,640
is going to be processed by data in the

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,799
fast lane which connects to an existing

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,280
cluster or creates one on the fly

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,679
and gets the data from almost any

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,039
database or almost any kind of files

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,439
it runs the dfl recipe and then in this

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,280
in this scenario i would put the data in

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,880
a in a database but it could be

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,240
you know on the screen or um as files or

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,200
whatever

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,520
so let's jump into a demo okay so i'm

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,120
going to pick to to run a very very

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,039
simple demo and show you

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:43,039
um and show you um a recipe as well

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:47,840
so let's get out of here okay

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,840
so let's look at that

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,320
okay so my first demo as you can see i'm

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,080
just going to run

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,400
uh dfl as a shell and my demo

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,960
is one from the repo which is dock slash

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,919
demo slash

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,640
display so it's going to take a csv file

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,440
a really

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,679
basic csv file and it's going to display

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,679
it

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,320
as well i'm showing some information

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,600
about the about the csv file okay

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,880
nothing really exciting but um it's the

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,559
first demo just to show you the

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,320
principle of it

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:24,320
so i started it so

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,640
in this scenario it's not connecting to

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,360
uh to an existing cluster it just spawns

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,120
a cluster

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,480
right right part of the part of the

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,400
process

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,799
and it's starting as a recipe and you

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,080
see it actually read my

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,799
books.csv file and it's counting the

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,640
number of records

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,640
sorry it's counting my number of records

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,240
i've got 24 rows in my file

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:52,000
displaying displaying um uh five rows

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:56,160
and showing me the schema of of what

00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
is in my file see if i look at my um

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,200
and my recipe um so to show you what it

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,120
looks like

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,640
you will see that it's a very basic file

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,360
let's run anyone's favorite

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,480
text editor and you see that it's

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,480
basically

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,640
i'm asking um i'm i'm starting

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,760
um i've got a magic container called a

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,919
store which

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,520
has an attribute called books then i'm

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,000
going to do some operations so my first

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,039
operation

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,080
is load from this pass

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,559
here then i'm going to

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,679
specify which format it is i'm going to

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,919
pass a few options

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,960
uh like saying hey this is it has a

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,919
header

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,400
it please infuse your schema so it knows

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,200
what an

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,679
int is what a string is and what is what

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,799
is a

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,840
what is a quote within the ingestion

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,280
process

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,600
and then finally the only thing i'm

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,120
doing is hey here's the operation it's

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,200
count rows operation

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,160
the next operation is show i've got two

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
parameters like

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
number of records and trunk eight

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,320
whether i want to

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:07,440
shorten or not display and print skier

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:10,559
okay very easy not that useful maybe

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,960
but it's uh it's to show you

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,840
what what uh what uh what we can do with

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,080
it

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,600
so let's let's look at a little bit of a

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,640
more slightly more

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,559
um slightly more interesting

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,559
uh objects and so in this scenario

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,559
i'm going to build a nested documents

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,240
from two tables

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,799
so i've got two

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,840
um two tables which are in a pulse quest

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,520
database here

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
um there's a little voters there's a

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,760
list of books and what i'm interested in

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,120
is building this nested

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,480
document which is composed of

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,120
a name an offer link a wikipedia link

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,679
a title and then every every box as a

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,180
list

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,799
okay i can actually

00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:00,880
[Music]

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,880
show you what it looks like in

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:10,559
in postgres and i show you the

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,559
the demo as well okay so let's get there

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,960
okay here is my here's postgres

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,559
uh making that a little bit bigger and

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,039
uh

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,080
maybe that's a little bit too big so

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,760
basically here

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,880
you you can see i have

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,400
two tables one is my offers uh

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,360
and the columns id names etc and you see

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,159
also my books

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,799
okay so and you see on the right side

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,000
here

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,480
something very simple uh

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,200
it's the same the same data here here is

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,280
my list

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,280
of offers now i'm going to

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,159
ask data in fastlane

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,880
to execute this demo this this and

00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:00,640
that's my

00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:04,880
demo too and create this nested document

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,799
and this is built nested document okay

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,159
so same thing it's starting creating a

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,360
cluster

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,440
and which is always at the text that the

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,440
little bit longer part uh when you're

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,080
dealing with spark

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,440
and then it's reading all the

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,760
configuration file

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,559
there's probably a little typo somewhere

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,640
there

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,159
and then it reads everything so it layer

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,640
it has read all my

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,640
offers

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,080
and then it reads uh

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,159
it reads my books oh i didn't display

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,520
the books and

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,480
you see the result okay so 25 25

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,039
uh 25 seconds for that so if i want now

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,080
to look

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,080
at the result as a json file

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,840
as my json file here you see that

00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,880
here i can see that damien denis draw

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,480
wrote two books uh

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,960
and i can see you know jk rowling uh

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,520
i can see all the list of books in that

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,919
so

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,880
you know pretty simple output and now we

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,799
can have a look

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,240
at the output as well at the recipe

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,000
itself

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,760
so the recipe is a bit is a bit more

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,159
complex but not that much okay

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,080
so here's my recipe see i'm defining the

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,840
first part of my recipe is i'm defining

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,200
a connection to a database

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,880
okay and this is really where of course

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
you don't put your password in a

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,600
configuration file okay

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,000
which i did here for demonstration

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,039
purposes only okay but but dfl is smart

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,840
enough to get

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,120
information from secrets or environment

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,640
viables

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,600
so and then my next step is

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,400
define my store where i'm going to load

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,520
my books

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,400
from jdbc my offers from the jdbc

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,559
connector

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,480
and then i can do a few operations okay

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,000
so first everything is called an id in

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,840
the database if you look at if you

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,120
if you look at the database here

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,640
everything is called an id

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,559
where i'm more interested in having a

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,960
book id and offer id

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,080
for making it easier for for me to make

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,679
joins after

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,400
so what i'm doing is renaming all these

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,200
columns

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,840
very easily as you can see i've got my

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,200
my id

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,840
i rename it to offer id my kernel link i

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
rename it to offerlink etc etc

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,840
and then i'm displaying a little bit of

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,240
information doing the same thing with

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,960
books

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,640
and then what i'm asking is creating

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,480
this table called works

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,760
and this is a complex operation which i

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,559
built which is a nested group by

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,520
where i'm taking a creating a new table

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,600
a new table

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,640
uh data frame technically in this prac

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,520
language

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,960
which is taking books and it's actually

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,640
creating this

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,159
uh this group by on the name of a link

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,360
on wikipedia

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,720
link and it's nesting the title

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,799
of the book the release date of the

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,760
table of the book and the link

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,039
of uh towards the book and then i'm

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,640
showing that quickly

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:15,279
and that's it okay so so that's really

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,400
um yeah if i were using something else i

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,200
could tell you the number of line of

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,960
code but it's

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,000
it's not that much line of code to do a

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,200
rather complex data operations here

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,720
so um

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,760
i was i was also telling you that

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:36,400
that we wear it's extensible

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:40,840
so let's look at my third demo

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,880
which is about this

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,200
extensibility

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,200
okay

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,480
so i i'm going you you're probably at

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,919
this case as well

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,120
okay so sometimes you get a table and

00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,960
in your table you have each you have

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,440
um you have data that have

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,880
you have multiple pro multiple keys are

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,400
actually building your primary keys and

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,679
that's really annoying because when you

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,080
want to make joins

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,480
you've got to you know you've got to

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,600
jones on post columns or creating

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,360
some kind of a composite key um

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,840
and that's that's that's that's a bit

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,640
annoying so what we had to do

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,279
is we created just a multiple uh a

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,120
primary key from multiple keys

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,760
and to do that i'm going to show you

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,760
the data

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:39,919
and i'm going to show you after how

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,760
we process that with with

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,840
data in the fast lane so let's look at

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,720
the data first and i'm just going to do

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,159
a cat

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,159
of data

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,679
product filter so here you can see my

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,880
data

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,880
um you see my part number

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,720
i've got a skew as well and i've got a

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,000
name and and a link

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,919
okay so this this

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,080
what what i'd like to solve as a problem

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,960
is to have a unique identifier

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,799
that will and that i can use for the

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,600
part number and the skew as well and

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,919
this queue

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,520
so let's let's run it and see how it

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,320
looks after that and then i'll show you

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,360
the recipe

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,360
so um

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:31,840
dfl and

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,840
it's going to be dock demo

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,679
demo three and i'm going to run it

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,360
okay same thing creating the cluster on

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,279
the fly

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,240
here it's showing the csv it's not a big

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:55,279
csv so it's something like five records

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,840
and here it is okay so um

00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,919
i've got my part number and q in a

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,559
tabular way which is a bit more readable

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,039
and where we've added is this that so

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,840
that's a

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,120
original file and that's a modified

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,480
that's a modified data

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,840
at the end of it and you see here that

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,559
um i've added a unique id that is

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,640
defined

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,960
based on my um part number and q

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,760
and if i of course the goal is that if i

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,120
rerun it

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,840
i get exactly the same values uh for

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:32,159
as my unique id otherwise it's going to

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:35,200
be a little bit not very useful right

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,919
and so how to do that

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,720
is we build a special a specific

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,120
operation

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,399
which is really a few lines of java code

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,880
in this situation

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,919
uh and see it's exactly the same so it's

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,039
uh eb

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:52,159
something and eb 90 here as well

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,760
um so and we are just

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,679
and it's not an operation you find in

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,120
spark so we leverage

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,840
what spark calls um user defined

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,320
functions

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,520
and that's that's how we've built this

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,039
part

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,039
okay so now if i run if i look at the

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,480
recipe

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,039
you see that that's it that's that's

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,840
what

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,320
15 lines of code basically so basically

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,760
i'm

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:27,600
i'm running uh i'm opening my uh

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,960
my my file called product uh

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,399
um the the path is that data slash

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,120
product slash filters dot csv it's a csv

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,600
file

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,640
it has a header i ask spark to infuse

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,440
the schema

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,200
and then i'm just telling hey create

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,320
this attribute id

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,919
and to do that you are going to when

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,120
actually there's a lot of show here

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:54,799
and then you just create this gen

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,000
this generate this uuid and you're going

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,520
to use partner

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,600
and skew okay so really

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:06,480
really uh fairly easy way to uh to um

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,919
to to to to start and to make to make

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,799
this kind of a data transformation

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,120
recipe

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,320
and and really what we we're focusing

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,279
about when

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,320
we we we're designing this tool is

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,520
multiple

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,279
personas that we'll be able to use

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,919
um is a fast lane so you can be a data

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,919
scientist

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:30,399
uh and you need um to

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,880
you know that in most in most companies

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,559
um data scientists they have to

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,279
they they do a lot of data engineering

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,640
work uh so

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,159
i'm not saying we have a solution for

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,240
that but at least the data engineering

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,480
work is is going to be a lot more

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,840
a lot a lot easier for that so that's

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,039
really uh

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,399
the typical persona for for sonia as a

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,679
data scientist

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,720
um a data engineer is

00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:00,640
is building extensions for for gfl

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,480
where uh dfl is um

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,679
uh can be ex can be extended like for

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,080
the gene gen

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,799
uuid i showed you and that's an

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,480
extension

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,559
and that's that's a word for typically

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,559
the data engineer and finally we've got

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,760
eric's devops who is in charge of

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,760
extending
