so thank you all

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,080
so much for joining um my name is alyssa

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,719
arvin

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,440
and i am a senior program manager for

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,480
the salesforce open source team

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,199
like you mentioned we're going to be

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,160
talking about how we are focusing on

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,359
building

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,359
the open source community

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
so here's what we're going to be going

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,719
over we're going to be talking about

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,760
why does salesforce care about open

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,120
source

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,320
we'll talk briefly about some of the

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,600
salesforce open source projects

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,719
giving back how we encourage our

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
employees to get back through open

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,680
source

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,120
foundations and committees were part of

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,039
and then what is next for salesforce

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,280
so like i mentioned my name is melissa

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,520
arvin and i'm a senior program manager

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,480
for the salesforce open source programs

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,800
office

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,440
i'm fairly new to the open source world

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,800
so i included my twitter handle on here

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,920
at alyssa arvin above if you

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,200
would connect with me we'd love to hear

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,439
you know what you're working on if

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,720
you're part of an ospo or just part of

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,200
the open source community and how

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,240
salesforce can help you out

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
i am a cat lady i have two cats right

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
now who

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,000
are very unhappy because they are locked

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,799
out of the office

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,280
so if my mic picks up any angry meowing

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,479
i'm

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,479
very sorry about that i also

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,920
the total cookie lover although i would

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,600
say my favorite is probably still just

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,479
the basic chocolate chips

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,799
and i love to run i did manage to get

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,360
one

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,280
in person half my marathon in this year

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,119
and then done a couple of virtual ones

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,320
as well

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,079
but enough about me let's jump into

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,920
why salesforce cares about open source

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,320
and i'm sure if you think of all the

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,000
companies who come to mind

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,159
when you're thinking about open source

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,119
salesforce probably isn't one of them

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,000
yet

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,399
and that's okay uh we we are working on

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,320
it

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,799
we're trying to get the word out more

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,479
because like most tech companies

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,520
open source has been a part of

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,680
salesforce's dna from the very beginning

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,959
so we actually started with our

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,959
programming language was

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,200
java which of course we all know is open

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,879
source and it has continued to be

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,319
extremely important for our company and

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,840
our engineering team

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,040
20 plus years later until today

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,000
and we realize it helps a lot with

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,800
our employee experience right it brings

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,760
in

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,959
faster new higher onboarding they

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,560
already know what they're coming in to

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,080
work on it cuts down on training and

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,959
onboarding

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,599
it increases developer productivity it

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,640
improves our internal processes

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,360
and cuts down on things like legacy code

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,800
and

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,400
trying to figure out what is going on

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,920
with that code

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,000
and it also helps with employee

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,440
retention you know our employees are

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
working on projects they're passionate

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,120
about

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,920
and it keeps them an interesting code

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
and our

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,280
open source programs office is fairly

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
new

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,080
we've had open source forever but having

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,400
dedicated staff to actually help

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
with the open source is something that

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,800
has only been around for a couple of

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,519
years

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,120
so here is one area that we're really

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,040
focusing on because we're trying to make

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,440
sure that our employees know that they

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,760
have

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,760
our support in making contributing to

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,760
and releasing open source as a part of

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,319
their day-to-day

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,680
and then you know the saying rising tide

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,760
lifts all ships

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,360
we know that investing in open source

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,239
means that we all win

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,840
our employees the open source community

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,519
the individual projects

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
as well as our company overall

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,400
so like i mentioned open source has been

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,680
a part of salesforce since the very

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
beginning

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,599
but i honestly wouldn't really be

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,680
surprised if you didn't realize

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,920
what projects had come out of salesforce

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,920
yet

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,760
but our engineers are releasing over a

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,239
hundred open source projects

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,599
every single year and this includes

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,080
projects like

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,360
lightning web component which is listed

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,480
lwc on this

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,239
slide and oaklef

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,160
and then we've even contributed several

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,560
projects to foundations

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,000
the most well-known one is probably

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,120
apache phoenix

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,840
but we also have apache prediction io

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,840
and then most recently we have cncf

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
buildpacks

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
this year is no different we're

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,240
definitely on track to

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
still have probably over 100 open source

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520
projects that came out

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,040
and so i wanted to include some of them

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,720
on this slide

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,880
because if you're not really familiar

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,840
with what salesforce has been open

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,240
sourcing

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,680
these are four great ones that are also

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,720
pretty different

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,600
in order for you to check out so if you

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,360
see

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,120
underneath where it says cloudsplaining

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,759
if you see salesforce

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
cloudplaning that is half of the github

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,360
web address

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,840
so if you go to github.com salesforce

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,199
cloudsplaining you'll be able to find

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,280
the project

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,680
so i'll give you just a really quick

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,199
blurb about each one of these projects

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,039
just so if you are interested

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,440
you know you know which one to go and

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,560
check out so cloudsplaining

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,680
came out of our security team and it is

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,840
an aws

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,880
identity access and management security

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
assessment tool

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,320
that identifies violations of lease

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,360
privilege and generates a risk

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,039
prioritized report

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,440
ai economist is from our research team

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,120
and the foundation is a flexible modular

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,759
and composable framework

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,360
to model socioeconomic behaviors and

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,360
dynamics with both agents and

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,000
governments

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,360
best is actually our newest one we just

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,360
open sourced it

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,120
right before this conference and it

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,800
allows you to write benchmarks the same

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
way you write unit tests

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,960
this allows you to integrate best into

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,800
your ci workflow to create a consistent

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,160
picture of your code's performance over

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,759
time

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,919
and then if we have any kubernetes fans

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,360
out there generic side car injector

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,520
you'll definitely want to check it out

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,479
it is a generic framework for injecting

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,720
side cars

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,319
and related configuration in kubernetes

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,680
using mutating web hook

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,240
admission controllers so like i said we

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,080
have

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,759
tons of projects if you were to just go

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,240
to github.com

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
salesforce you would see all of them but

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,479
i just wanted to highlight

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,440
four of them um for you to check out if

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,360
if you haven't really seen what

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,560
salesforce is working on

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,759
so you know we're not just asking our

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,960
employees to put out

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,720
open source projects we also want

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,400
them to contribute to open source as

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,520
well and

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,039
we've really been focusing on this this

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,440
year

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,199
because we want both people who are

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,960
contributing for the first time

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
as well as people who normally

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,319
contribute and have it already as a part

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,039
of their day-to-day

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,800
but we realize that sometimes people

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,479
need a boost in order to contribute for

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,560
the first time

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,400
and others need a reminder because we

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,280
all know you can get caught up in your

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,759
day-to-day

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,800
job and you just kind of get out of the

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,919
habit or

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,080
forget to check in on open source so

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,360
as we were thinking about you know how

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,440
we can make sure that we're

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,919
continuing to get people to contribute

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,639
and and just think of open source

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,440
as part of their day to day uh we came

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,240
up with this plan

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,759
to encourage our employees to give back

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,759
or volunteer through open source

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,080
the reason we did this is because giving

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,639
back is

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,080
huge to salesforce um so this the

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,639
numbers on the slide are

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,199
this is for giving back in general um

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,000
but

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,120
you know in over 20 years we've had

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,599
something called the one one

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,120
one pledge which gives one percent of

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,720
the companies time

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,120
equity and product to non-profit

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,479
so if you see on here uh employees have

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,759
given over four and a half

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,560
million volunteer hours and we're

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,000
encouraged to donate 56 hours per year

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,280
of our time to nonprofits so

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,960
you know we're thinking of how do we

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,160
make sure people are continuing to focus

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,759
on open source

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,599
and then also we're always trying to

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,240
make sure that we're hitting the goal of

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,080
volunteer

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,919
time off and so we thought there's got

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,919
to be some way that we can combine this

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,919
right so we came up with what we call

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,120
volunteer time off or if you hear me say

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,680
bto

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,080
events that are focused on humanitarian

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,200
free and open source projects

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,279
so we're holding quarterly events we've

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,479
done two so far and we have one next

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,120
week

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,480
and the uh first one we did was focus

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,480
around projects that

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,600
were helping with covet relief and

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,480
hospitals

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,120
and then the second one was focused on

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,279
our employee resource groups

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,560
so we normally start it off with a tech

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,320
talk from one of our open source

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,839
contributors

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
and we record it in case people aren't

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
able to join it live

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,200
and then we block off three hours for

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,800
our employees to use towards giving

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,279
back um and here we suggest

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,320
four projects that they can contribute

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,440
to they don't have to use those four

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,480
but we choose four that we know have

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,080
a welcoming community and that have good

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,440
first issue tags

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,080
so we'll make sure that we're really

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,880
sharing the fact that it is good for

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,560
newcomers

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,920
so if people are using open source but

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,800
they've never given back

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,040
to open source they know this is a good

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
project to start with

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,360
another really cool thing about this is

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,800
it can be done completely remote

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,640
and so you know we are a global company

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,279
but we've always kind of run into this

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,959
issue where our events have been focused

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,399
at hq which is san francisco for us

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,160
so when josh and i were coming up with

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,600
this program we wanted to make sure that

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,880
it didn't matter

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,760
where you are you can participate in

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,279
this event

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,959
so even though we might have the three

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,880
hours blocked and it might not be the

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,880
appropriate time for your time zone

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,040
all we ask is that you just block off

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,600
three hours so someone in singapore

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,800
can still work on this event it might

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
just be a different time that someone in

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
san francisco is doing it

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,320
and it's been really successful you know

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,279
we wanted to hit

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
500 hours for the year and like i

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,600
mentioned we've only done two events so

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,800
far

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,839
and we've already had over 350 hours of

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,440
volunteering towards the open source

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,680
project

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,040
so if you're interested in setting it up

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,959
at your company

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,880
um or even if you're just interested in

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,040
doing it on your own

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,079
we did put out a blog with more

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,800
information

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,600
and the link is here but if you also go

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,279
to engineering.salesforce.com

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,040
if you just search just pledge one

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,560
percent it will um pop

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,880
up for you so it has more information on

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,640
open source as a way to give back as

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,279
well as step-by-step instructions on how

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,800
to host

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,800
an event at your own company

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,839
and of course you know it doesn't just

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,279
stop with those two areas

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,880
we also want to make sure that we are

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,600
financially supporting open source as

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,920
well

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,160
so we do have foundations and committees

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,399
that salesforce is part of

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,120
and we break it down into four main

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,480
areas which are listed here

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,200
and i just excuse me i just listed a few

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,200
things this is

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
definitely not a full list of the things

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,440
that salesforce is involved in

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,040
but you can see here like these are the

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,920
three projects that

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,240
we are financially supporting um you

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,040
know whether it be monthly or giving one

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,200
large donation towards them but we also

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,920
have something called a foss fund

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,680
and that is a framework for giving back

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,279
to the open source community

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,279
where your company decides to give a

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,320
dedicated amount to fund a specific

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,680
open source project and how how you

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,200
determine that amount is

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,360
actually your open source contributors

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,399
are telling you through a nomination and

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
voting

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,839
so if you're interested in learning more

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,440
about what a foss fund is

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,200
i'm actually giving a talk tomorrow with

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,760
jade applegate from indeed

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,959
and it's at 3 30 p.m eastern so we'll

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,320
dig into

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,120
why you should start your fault fun at

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,040
your company and how you do that

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,040
we also sponsor a ton of open source

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
events so we have a few of them listed

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,320
here

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,079
and you can see it goes all the way from

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,519
community events like open source

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,120
mexico to language specific events

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,920
like go for con and pycon to larger

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,279
conferences such as of course all things

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,720
open here we are

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,040
and we'll be at qcon next month as well

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,079
uh we're part of foundations of course

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,279
the to-do group

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,720
clip group apache software foundation

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,240
again there's a few others that were

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,839
part of but i just wanted to call out

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,079
three

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,680
and finally we support standards bodies

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,360
um we actually

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,160
in january i believe it was held a tc39

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,800
meeting

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,079
at salesforce so we try to you know

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,360
provide different ways to give support

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,360
we just you know we really realize how

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,639
important it is for us to continue to

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
support open source

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,200
both financially and through our

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,720
employees contributing to open source

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,200
we know that salesforce relies heavily

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,839
on open source and so we want to make

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,120
sure that we're really doing our part

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,880
to make sure the projects and

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,880
communities remain strong as well

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,880
i mentioned in the beginning that the

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,399
sales force

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,240
also is fairly new um so we have two

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,240
dedicated staff members which is

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,680
josh simmons who's on the call and

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,680
myself

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,240
and so we know you know we're just very

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,680
beginning stages of this and we're just

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,720
starting to scratch the surface of

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,959
everything that

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,240
salesforce can do in order to make sure

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,839
that we are really supporting the

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,639
community

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,199
so we have a lot of things coming out

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
with

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,000
through the end of this year next year

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,000
long-term planning

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,760
but i just want to point out two things

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,600
to keep an eye out

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,079
we're going to be open sourcing our

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,040
marketing documentation

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,560
so i actually created these two docs and

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
originally it was just going to be for

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,839
our employees it was

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,920
how to name your open source project and

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,120
then how to market your open source

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,480
project

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,720
um because these were things that

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,639
employees kept coming and asking us for

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,839
help on and we wanted to make sure that

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,040
everyone had access to this and you know

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,480
we realized that

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,720
we're getting really positive feedback

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,000
from our employees around it and we just

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
realized this was something that could

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,360
benefit

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,160
everyone so we're going to be open

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,120
sourcing all of these docs

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,079
probably end of year beginning of

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,000
january

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,519
um so if you follow us on twitter which

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,720
is at salesforce eng

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,800
you'll be able to see when these are

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,000
released we

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,160
also launched something called an

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
accidental maintainer series

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,279
um and we just did a moderated chat

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,720
about it right before this

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,959
at 11 am and

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
so you know it's focusing on the fact

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,639
that we know

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,560
most open source project maintainers

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,440
become maintainers because they solved a

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,480
problem

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,279
and they want to share that solution

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,240
but like rarely do maintainers

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,240
anticipate the

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,920
ongoing commitment and additional skills

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,760
that are required to cultivate a healthy

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,839
project and community

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,360
you know this can be things like

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,560
cultural competence

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,480
um community management even marketing

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,160
how we're we're open for marketing uh

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,480
the technical writing the documents you

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,279
have to put out so we're starting to put

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,240
together different

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,120
themes that we'll be talking about and

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
the cool thing is

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,920
is it's not not our company coming and

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,279
saying hey this is how you do it

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,040
we're actually interviewing different

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,360
projects and

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,279
uh people in the community to ask them

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,600
how did you do this

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,320
so our acting maintainer series on

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,360
governance

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,320
is already out and we talked to django

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,000
python and cloudsplaining and it was

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,040
really cool to see how the different

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,120
projects

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,160
viewed governance when they were first

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,920
setting it up

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,600
how they viewed it in the middle and

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,120
then how they view it now

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,959
and and kind of how it changed

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,240
throughout and they adapted

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,959
that was a really cool series i

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,000
definitely recommend checking it out

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,560
we will also our next topic is

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,040
inclusive communities and then we'll be

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,120
talking about

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,639
transferring to a foundation surviving

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,639
the maintainer's exit and gracefully

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,440
deprecating a project

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,560
so this area with everything we're doing

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,360
we obviously

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,839
want to partner with good people um hear

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,120
any suggestions that you have

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,120
with especially with accidental

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,440
maintainer series um

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,279
you know we we want to know how you as a

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,320
maintainer what you need in order to be

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,759
successful

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,440
so if you're looking at this and you're

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,320
like oh when i

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
became a maintainer i struggled with x

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,600
or

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,559
you know i had to learn why the hard way

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,559
let us know

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,839
we'd love to hear what that is because

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,600
most likely if you

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,360
have been struggling with it or you had

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,760
to learn it the hard way other people

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,520
also

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,959
are as well so follow us on twitter

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,000
at salesforce and you know we'd love to

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,600
connect with you there

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,760
and see what ways that we can partner

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,520
and what you have for thoughts

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,960
um but i have some resources on here

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,720
as well we have our open source website

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,160
and our github are probably the two main

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,039
things you know that you'll want to

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,480
check out

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,000
and then like i said our salesforce

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
engineering twitter and my personal

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,640
twitter as well

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,559
so i made this presentation short on

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,280
purpose because

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,720
since salesforce is also so new you know

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,760
we wanted to give you a heads up of what

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,919
we're working on

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,520
but we really wanted to take this time

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,520
also to chat

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,559
with you and see how we can better

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,120
support you

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,280
or ideas that you've done at your own

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,000
ospos that have really worked well

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,520
i'd love to open it up to questions now

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,360
um you can either

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,880
put them in the chat and you know like

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,919
they said make sure you're putting them

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,400
public

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,200
um or if i believe if you raise your

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,240
hand we

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,840
can also mute you um so at this point

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,080

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,919

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,280
in the link to our accidental maintainer

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,200
um the governance

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,520
series so definitely check that out if

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,600
you are

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,840
a new maintainer a maintainer or

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,840
thinking about open sourcing a project

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,440
while we well we give folks a moment to

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,960
drop some questions into the chat i will

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,840
i want to underscore one of the things

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,400
that alyssa spoke to in her

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,760
presentation that you know the the ospo

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,000
the open source programs office at

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,760
salesforce is is definitely new

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,039
um but like any like any tech company

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
open source has been a part of what we

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,200
do from the from the beginning as you

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,280
mentioned

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,360
just just choosing the language java for

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,200
starters

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,360
but what's been so cool you know i'm new

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,039
to salesforce in the last couple years

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,840
here

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,640
and like alyssa alluded to at the

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,400
beginning

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,080
i did not think of salesforce when i

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
thought about open source in companies

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,640
that contribute to open source

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,600
and so when i heard that salesforce was

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,760
hiring

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,600
a dedicated staff for it i jumped at the

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,280
opportunity because

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,679
well here's a company that doesn't have

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,679
uh you know a an established reputation

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,360
in this area yet

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,000
but it's a major company and that seems

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,320
to me like a huge opportunity

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,640
so uh i was delightfully surprised

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,960
when i finally started a couple years

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,600
ago and i realized that you know not

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,280
only

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,960
is there like java and there's you know

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,240
the ex the standard like okay yes we're

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,159
running a lot of machines that are

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,000
running on on linux and

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,760
you know there's kubernetes and there's

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,159
open source up and down the stock like

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,600
you

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,360
totally expect what i didn't expect

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,280
was just how much open source software

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,559
salesforce had already been releasing

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,120
and had already transferred to

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,559
foundations

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,720
i was uh one of my previous employers

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,720
they they had released an open source

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,720
project they had contributed to

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,760
a foundation the apache software

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,080
foundation

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,240
and they were ecstatic when that project

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,080
finally graduated to be a full

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,840
out of the incubator to be a full apache

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,960
software foundation project

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,720
and they should be that's a huge

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,200
accomplishment for anybody to get to

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,200
that point

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,960
but then i come to salesforce and i find

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,400
out that salesforce has two

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,240
projects that have been contributed to

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
the apache software foundation and ahri

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,640
made it out of the incubator

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,320
so you know i'm really excited to to be

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,760
here at all things open to be talking a

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,159
little more about what salesforce is

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,360
doing

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,080
in open source um yes this session is a

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,600
little bit naval gazelly

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,280
you know a little bit of navel gazing

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,679
looking at like what we're doing

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,200
um but you know we're putting out a lot

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,520
of content a lot of things

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,120
around all things open because we don't

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,720
want to be focused on ourselves the

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,240
whole point of open source is

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,000
you know there's this this massive

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,320
community that we're all participating

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,799
in

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,440
and benefiting from and we want to we

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,120
want to

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,799
share how we're getting back to that and

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,880
hopefully encourage some other companies

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,039
who are in our space to do the same

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,480
that's that's really the biggest impact

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,159
we're looking to have yes we want to

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,039
support communities we want to hear from

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,559
you

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,640
uh the ways we can better support you

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,000
but really if salesforce can just add a

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,520
little more weight to like well this is

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,960
what a company should be doing in open

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,120
source to give back

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,799
um that's that's a win in our book

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,000
because we we want to see

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,480
uh you know we're following in the

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,720
footsteps of other companies who've

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,640
been giving back a lot and let's just uh

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,840
let's just keep that rolling

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,159
and with that i see we have a question

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,280
now

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,000
yeah i brian i'm not able to click

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,320
on the if i click on it nothing happens

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,480
i

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,320
can't pull up what the question is i can

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,960
i can it's it's from uh

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,720
troy curtis asks what kinds of qualities

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,880
do you look for when selecting

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,919
your recommended projects for the one

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,919
percent uh

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,159
pledge one percent you would mention the

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,360
community should be welcoming but what

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,600
other things

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,520
are you looking for um do you have any

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,320
examples of

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,960
some some uh past projects possibly that

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,960
you could recommend

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,360
yes um so when we're looking at it

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,200
like we said we want to make sure okay

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,320
so we want to make sure that they have

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,039
um issues that are open so we look for

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,640
good first issue tags we even look for

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,240
documentation tags

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,720
we want to get our technical writers

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,840
more involved and open source

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,960
but we want to make sure that first of

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,480
all there's things that people can

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,039
contribute you to

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,480
and that is active and that's one thing

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,840
we kind of found in the beginning was we

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,640
were finding these projects that looked

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,240
awesome

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,919
but they definitely were not active

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,559
projects anymore um

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,960
they didn't have any issues open there

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,679
wasn't

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,720
a lot of activity happening on it once

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,200
we have that

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,159
we check to make sure that they have

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,760
documentation

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,400
on how to get set up how to do it

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,159
code of conduct is actually one we

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,919
didn't look for our first round

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,679
but was a recommendation from one of our

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,760
employees um you know make sure that the

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,240
projects have a code of conduct

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,840
um and then we'll reach out to the

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,840
project maintainers

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,600
just to let them know you know some

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,640
projects they might get

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,679
one pull request but others might get

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,080
20 plus and so we want to make sure that

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,080
they're aware that we're doing it and

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,720
that they're set up to

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,159
receive the pull request coming in and

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,159
we're not overwhelming them

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,760
and so you know we we give them the

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,679
opportunity to say

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,600
this is not a great time for us right

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,120
now um and that's totally

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,120
fine you know we want to make sure that

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,480
we're definitely not harming any of the

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,720
projects by doing this volunteer event

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,760
so those are the main ways we also come

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,039
up with themes

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,559
so we try to we do that just to try and

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,080
keep things like focused and have

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,919
different things throughout

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,760
and then people you know if they weren't

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,000
as interested in like the coveted relief

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,000
but

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,279
then they had strong ties to an employee

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,480
resource group

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:55,120
then they can jump into that one um

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,159
so those are the main things that we

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,480
look for

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,600
um did i miss anything there josh

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,000
anything else that we're

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,200
taking into account no i think you

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,840
really covered our bases

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,679
the the uh good first issue tags

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,720
guidance on how to get started

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,000
uh code of conduct uh regular activity

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,039
those are all things that we look for to

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,240
make sure that it's gonna be a good

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,360
first experience for

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,360
for our staff

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,039
the second part of that question was you

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,100
know are there specific examples

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,880
of of projects

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,840
[Music]

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,799
and just uh just a couple so as alyssa

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,480
mentioned the first

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,960
the first time we we held an event like

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,120
this i was really at the the very

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,400
early stages of the pandemic here in in

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,720
the united states

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,440
and so we focused the the projects we

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,360
recommended

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,640
on that and i've granted every time we

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
run these events we give people the

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,799
opportunity to pick any project they

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,679
like

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,960
but we want to uh we do pick a theme

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,120
because we do want to keep it focused

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
and we want to

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,960
you know make it easy for people who

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,559
maybe don't know where to start um

00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,559
and so in that first event we did really

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,840
tackle things that were specific to

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,960
the pandemic or somehow related to it uh

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:11,039
so one of those was the project

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,960
next strain uh which has been used to

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,240
uh sort of like it's like an open

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,320
science project

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,400
uh where people are tracking the genome

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,000
of of covid19

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,080
as it evolves in around the world um

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,200
which has helped for contact tracing and

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,440
also helps with the

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,240
efforts to synthesize therapeutics and

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,440
drugs to

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,960
address the issue but we didn't just

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,400
look at the the research side of things

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,760
because we know that everybody's got

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,360
like a slightly different interest and

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,240
might want to engage with the subject in

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,760
different ways

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,720
so we also looked at a

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,159
hospital run a hospital run being a

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,919
project that is used

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:52,880
to support hospitals in developing

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,279
developing countries uh we also worked

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,320
on

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,279
i believe it was uh opia

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,640
um maybe it wasn't obvious but we had a

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,120
distance learning project

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,720
right because in amid the pandemic you

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,840
know we need to do a lot more distance

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,000
learning

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,440
there's a fourth one i can't remember uh

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,799
so that was our first

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,600
i think that's right ushihidi uh which

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,760
is uh

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,960
which is a major fantastic project that

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,679
was spun up in the

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,320
wake of the haiti earthquake i believe

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,039
uh

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,919
that is really focused on uh disaster

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,720
response

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,080
uh and coordination um and you know

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,000
there's often a lot of

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,520
information or misinformation when

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,720
people are trying to coordinate disaster

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,080
response on the ground in the wake of

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,440
these events

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,279
so that was our focus for the first

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,039
event our second one as alyssa mentioned

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,679
was focused on our employee resource

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,000
groups

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,720
uh or we also call them our equality

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
groups

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,039
so these are the groups who are

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,640
representing for instance uh

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,240
black people and people of color who

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,520
work at the company or people with

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,000
disabilities

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,440
uh people who are part of the lgbtqia

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
plus community

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,640
and so we picked projects that aligned

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,679
with

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,120
uh support of those communities

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,039
for instance we picked one called

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,120
rebuild black businesses

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,640
which is really about looking at black

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,679
businesses who had been

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,679
impacted in the wake of the pandemic and

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,679
and sort of the political unrest that we

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,200
have here in the us right now

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,520
really looking at businesses that have

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,080
been

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,559
impacted negatively and crowdsourcing

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,360
ways to support them

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,799
for abilityforce our disability

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,000
community

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,559
we picked axe which is a popular project

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,679
for

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,760
uh doing testing accessibility testing

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,039
and we use it heavily internally as

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,640
salesforce

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,559
so really every every time we pick a

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,840
theme pick a set of projects that we

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,720
think will speak to a few different

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,720
types of interests

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,440
and uh and then we see see where people

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,440
go from there

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,039
yeah and i think the volunteer events

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,520
have been something that has

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,799
surprised me the most with this when

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,640
josh and i started

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,720
we we didn't really know if people were

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,679
gonna be interested in this or not

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,320
and like i said we've already had 350

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,559
hours

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,880
um and we were just like okay let's try

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,520
and hit 500 you know this year

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,080
and the cool thing is um i've had people

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,960
email me from all over the world and say

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,480
oh i can't attend the three hours that

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,399
you blocked off

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,159
uh but can i do another time and i'm

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,880
like yeah this is something you can do

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,399
anytime um and at salesforce we always

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,240
log our hours so i just tell them i'm

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,600
like make sure to log your hours

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,520
we have an open source contributors uh

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,960
event i guess that's open all the time

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,200
that they just go and log the day

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,960
and how many hours so that's been really

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,559
cool to see like even

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,120
outside of the event people are

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,840
continuing to circle back to this

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,640
and contribute to it throughout the year

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,279
um

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,000
so we've had you know this one person

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,679
and i think i

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,880
want to say they're in singapore they're

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,399
definitely not in the us i'm pretty sure

00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,000
they're in singapore

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,919
and he has been contributing um almost

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,919
every month at this point and he'll just

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,760
do a couple hours at a time

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,039
but you know that right there is awesome

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,799
because he's giving back he's also

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,880
continuing to contribute to open source

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,720
which is one of our mine and josh's

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,799
goals for the years how do we get people

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,240
to make it a part of their everyday job

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,679
so that's definitely that that's been

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,120
one project that i think has honestly

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,360
been my favorite this year because it

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,960
totally surprised me on the success that

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,360
we've had with it

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,120
um and we will we're planning to

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,880
continue to open source

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,799
a lot of our documentation so right now

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,080
we just have a blog out

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,320
but it could be something you know we

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,480
can look into to

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,919
open source more information about that

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,559
so then every quarter

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,440
when we select new projects we can put

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,880
it in there

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,960
and you can check out you know which

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,520
ones are coming up this quarter

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,240
and see if you want to do it alongside

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,360
us

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,360
when we're doing it internally

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,360
i'll let just one little uh one more

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,840
thing to the conversation around our

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,120
volunteer events

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,519
you know the goal for us is to

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,840
as alissa mentioned at the start to get

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,760
open source contribution to be a part of

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,720
sort of the day-to-day

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,440
workflow for people um and that's only

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,120
true for

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,320
a maybe 15 uh people who work in our

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,760
technical work right now

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,919
and we want to go we want to do way

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,880
better than that um

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,440
and what we realize is that for a lot of

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,919
people

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,480
even if they've been in their in their

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,880
role

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,039
as uh as a developer or technical writer

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,039
for

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,720
you know for a decade or more they still

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,320
may not have

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,919
had an opportunity to contribute to open

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,679
source and

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,279
in fact open source might still be a bit

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,640
of a black box for them you know maybe

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,559
they know they use a lot of open source

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,679
tools but they never contributed back

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,080
so they just don't know what that

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,480
experience is like

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,279
so what we do is we use these events not

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,600
just as

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,440
like yes we're volunteering and that's

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,519
that's good in its own right

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,080
but we're also we're trying to use that

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,279
volunteering experience

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,120
as a way to get people to make that

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,240
first contribution because that first

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,360
one

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,279
is always the hardest if only because of

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,720
the psychological barrier that's there

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,000
because it's the first time somebody is

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,679
doing something

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,600
and so by picking different themes each

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,120
quarter in different sets of projects

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,360
which use different sets of

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,720
different technology stacks you know we

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,679
we get an opportunity

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,880
to you know over the course of the year

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,640
we're going to hit on at least

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,559
one or two projects that a person is

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,360
interested in contributing to

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,440
um and of course we we hang out in in

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,799
slack or online while people are are

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,120
doing it during the

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,799
designated time and we're always

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,320
available to help people who have those

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,880
questions and need a little hand holding

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,880
along the way

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,720
and i just put the um link to the blog

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,720
in the chat as well it had linked to it

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,039
in there but um just so you guys all

00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,039
have it

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,559
but are there any other questions

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,559
um

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,960
yeah i've got yeah i got one i just uh

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
so do

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,720
do you have plans i know you mentioned

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,799
the lightning web components and

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,720
are there plans to kind of continue that

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,720
effort like in the

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:24,640
main code going forward with with new

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:26,640
features and functions

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,240
could you repeat that just uh once more

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,840
it it is there

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,399
and you you mentioned that you know

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,360
you've you've uh introduced open source

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,360
to

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,200
um a lot of your new features and

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,240
functions like the lightning components

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,640
um are there plans to kind of continue

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,880
that

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,440
going forward with with new features and

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,440
releases

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:53,440
yes so the idea

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,720
behind lightning web components um you

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,320
know salesforce is

00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,000
is not new technology right and uh

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,360
the interface that i had previously i

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,840
think we we called that the aura

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,200
framework which was also open source

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,919
um uh you know we the the front-end

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,679
interface

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,359
or the framework that we use to build on

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,359
top of the salesforce platform

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,760
uh so has been open source for i think

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,599
aura was 2014 2015.

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,520
it's not it's not that old um

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,800
so the big idea behind open sourcing the

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,760
the front-end frameworks

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,320
uh that we use on our software uh was

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,599
that

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,760
anybody who's developing in the

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,240
salesforce ecosystem

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,679
because there's there's a huge ecosystem

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,079
of software

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,079
built just on top of salesforce

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,560
what we wanted to do is we wanted to

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,079
help people who are

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,560
already doing that by

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,079
releasing a framework uh releasing the

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,720
framework that we're using so that they

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,159
can use it

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,159
in their other applications that are

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,760
sort of built in this

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,040
product ecosystem um you know people use

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,599
lightning web components

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,079
to work on other interfaces that's

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,400
that's

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,079
icing on the cake uh but definitely

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,599
we've open source it because we see it

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,160
as part of encouraging sort of the

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,079
ecosystem development around salesforce

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,760
and i think you'll see that as a

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,320
a strategy going forward you know it's

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,760
something we i think we started dabbling

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,280
in with the release of aura

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,720
and we're really just getting that dial

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,160
then to figure out how we can best

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,920
encourage that the growth of

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,760
an open source ecosystem around those

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,680
tools um

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,440
so we're we're still sort of figuring it

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,560
out uh lightning web components was a

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,359
was a huge

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,119
uh a huge improvement over aura being

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,400
that it's you know standards based on

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,359
web components

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,680
um i expect you'll see more of that

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,440
going forward from us because we

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,720
we realize that it's not

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,880
just useful for building out an

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,240
ecosystem um

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,079
but really like the reason people come

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,880
to salesforce and pay us money is not

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,640
because of

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,440
you know that that software is because

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,440
of the whole thing that we

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,960
operationalize so as much of the

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,560
the top of the stack as we can open

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,560
source as possible to make

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,320
life easier on people you know we're

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,400
going to be doing that

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,680
oh that's that's fantastic and it is a

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,480
user of the lightning the lightning

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,400
components

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,560
daily um no i very impressed

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,480
yes oh i'm so pleased to hear that i

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,320
haven't i haven't had a chance to use it

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,599
to deploy it myself so i'm pleased to

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,800
hear some a testimonial there

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,920
our uh we also have a salesforce.org arm

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,720
of salesforce which is focused on um

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,079
non-profits and they are josh do you

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,480
remember when they're speaking because

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,000
they're actually talking about how

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,400
they have they've had something called

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,240
open source commons and that is for

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,480
all of our non anyone has access to it

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,040
but our nonprofits use it

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,160
a lot because they realize okay if we

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,640
set up

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,320
you know salesforce this way for this

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,119
one specific food bank it's actually

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,520
going to work

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,400
for all of the food banks um to some

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,440
extent

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,760
so they have really focused on using

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,119
open source uh to benefit our

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,119
non-profits

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,640
so they're speaking i think josh is

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,560
looking for their time

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,079
um and it's two people from salesforce

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,839
and then they have a customer

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,280
talking about it as well so that could

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,200
be really interesting

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,040
to see you know kind of how salesforce

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,040
was really using open source within our

00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:23,359
