thanks everyone hello

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,920
so my name is john walkie and i'm with

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,880
puja mystery

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,960
and we are here to talk about uh call

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,279
for code and in particular

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,160
some announcements that ibm made earlier

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,960
today

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,359
as part of our keynote presentation uh

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,800
so

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,560
we're first we're going to introduce you

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,599
to call for code and then we're going to

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,359
come back

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,359
and we're going to spend some time

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,240
talking about call for code for racial

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,200
justice

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,160
which is as you would expect and a

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,040
really important

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,000
topic that i think all of us want to

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,800
learn more about

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,160
so as an open source community we have a

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,440
great opportunity to go

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,200
in and together make a difference and so

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,480
before we get to call for code for

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,079
racial justice

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,360
i wanted puja mystery to take us through

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,399
our call for code and and the 2020

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,600
set of challenges puja yeah

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,920
thanks so much john um so hi everyone my

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,680
name

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,799
is puja mestri i am a developer advocate

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,439
here at ibm and john and i

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,600
have been working on some of the open

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,280
source aspects of copper code

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,240
and so thank you guys all for joining

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,159
so basically the coffer code challenge

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,960
encourages developers and problem

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,119
solvers

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,560
of all different backgrounds to answer

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,400
the call and

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,079
solve some of the most world's most

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,200
pressing issues

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,799
um since its launch in 2018 this

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,840
movement has grown over

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,280
400 000 developers and problem problem

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,960
solvers over 179 nations worldwide

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,799
so we've been able to grow this

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,880
community immensely

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,479
and through this process through the

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,320
coffer code developers

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,479
can connect learn share their expertise

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,680
and build open source solutions that can

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,880
scale around the world

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,640
and be uh deployed in individual

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,360
communities and we've seen this in the

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,479
past with our 2018 coffer code as well

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,200
as our 20

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,080
um 2018 call for code with project owl

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,879
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,360
call for code with pro mateo and this

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,640
year

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,680
we've actually just announced our 2020

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,040
finalists and winners which i'll get get

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,400
into as well

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,120
so every year we usually

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,120
pick some themes that you know we want

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
to direct coffer code around

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
and this year we've actually picked

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,080
climate change as one of the most

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,280
pressing themes um uh

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,080
for for 2020. so basically

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,519
we want to encourage developers to kind

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,720
of build solutions that

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,000
tackle climate change um there's been a

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,640
global survey that

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,239
reveals that 77 of developers and first

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,239
responders say that

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,720
climate change is one of the most single

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,760
pressing issues of their generation

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,280
and this is why you know we decided to

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,400
make this a theme

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,120
so to help our developers

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,080
tackle this issue we've actually focused

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,360
on three

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,560
key areas so we focused on water

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
sustainability

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,239
energy sustainability and disaster

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,280
resiliency

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,080
and these three areas um what we've done

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,560
is we've actually

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:26,000
created these solution starter solutions

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,159
uh which are basically uh open source

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,159
projects that are aimed to help

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,239
developers get inspired

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,920
and see how we at ibm have kind of

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,360
tackled these issues

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,360
and since they're open source we show

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
our developers what they can do with

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,599
certain ibm technologies

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,720
so for example with our water

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,599
sustainability starter kit we were able

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,040
to kind of

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,519
um figure out a

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,400
a kit that addresses the weather data

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,640
and water

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,560
quality through data science and hyper

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,280
local weather forecasting

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,000
um our energy our energy sustainability

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,200
kit

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,319
uh leverages ai and iot to harness the

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,480
power of data

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,480
to construct trends and pinpoints to

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,720
reduce energy consumption

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,759
and finally our disaster resiliency

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,840
um helps reduce toxic exposure

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,799
by leaning on machine learning

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,720
capabilities

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,919
to devise hardware and software

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,120
solutions to reduce toxic exposures

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,840
so all three of these um start solution

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
starters

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,560
are uh actually available open source

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,040
and they're available on you know github

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,280
and

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,639
ibm developers so for those of you

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,040
especially joining

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,240
um you know all things open and want to

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,160
see what our

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,080
ecosystem is like you know you can

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,199
definitely check these starter kits out

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,280
as well

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,479
so you know 2020 of course has been

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
a crazy scary one of the most eventful

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,720
years

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,280
of us all and you know we could not

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,919
do this cover code challenge without

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,520
also

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,639
expanding it to include the coven 19

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,199
theme so this year was definitely a

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,240
unique year because not only did we

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,800
um you know expand it um

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680
to include this theme but where you know

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,400
we've got much

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,320
more participation we also got created

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,759
another whole set of starter solution

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,880
starter kits as well

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,240
to encourage uh developers to take on

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,440
the coven 19 challenge and so

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,000
you know this was an additional theme

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,000
so developers could choose either the

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,960
climate change track or the kogin 19

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,840
track

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,520
and we actually created similarly to the

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,639
climate change we created

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,080
um three different solution starter kits

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,759
around the topics of crisis

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,199
communication remote

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,319
education and community cooperation

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,360
and so these uh

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,120
tracks actually created we

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,039
all created these three open source

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,360
project projects

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,280
actually john and i we worked on the

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,479
crisis communication

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,560
starter kit and we used basically the

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,319
inspiration behind this was to actually

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,600
use chatbots and

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,080
um chatbot integrations to assist

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
with messaging especially during this

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,039
time of

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,400
crisis in this space so

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,039
we also have a kit on remote education

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,600
and

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,960
community corporation and these are

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,120
really designed to

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,759
really encourage developers like

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,800
yourselves to be part of the ecosystem

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,840
contribute to some of these existing uh

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,759
technologies

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,080
as well as use them as inspiration to

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,479
build some of your own technologies so

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,319
i know remote education um you'll

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,120
actually see that one of our finalists

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,000
kind of

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,120
used that theme to go forward and was

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,120
able to win

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,840
when a place um as our top final five

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,440
so you know by this point you're

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,240
probably wondering you know why

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,039
why do this and why why take all this

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,520
time and

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,880
contribute and be part of this well you

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,440
know there's a couple of really

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,000
main big reasons of course you know you

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,400
want

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,919
a lot of us are looking to use

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,240
technology and

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,160
build something good out of it you know

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,199
and so this is what this global

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,240
challenge

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,800
mainly aims to do it makes aims to kind

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,280
of

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,440
help these and reduce like the impact of

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,080
climate change copen 19 some of the most

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,280
pressing

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,520
issues of our time and every year we aim

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,560
to kind of tackle some of the most

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,960
uh pressing issues that we're working on

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,759
and finally once you know you can once

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
you do

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,199
take part in this you you're actually

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,080
joining a movement of over

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,199
200 000 uh developers worldwide over 165

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,759
nations so

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,800
it's a really really big community to be

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,960
involved in

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
and finally you will actually if you win

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,000
you actually have the chance to win 200

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,440
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,599
and um get open support open source

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,120
support from the linux foundation

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,440
and work with mentors and investors

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,319
and actually implement your project and

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,560
bring it to life

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,400
so this isn't like any other hackathon

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,800
where you're just submitting something

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,960
it's

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
your you really have a chance where you

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,800
can actually make your

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,240
your solution a reality and we've seen

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,120
that in 2019

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
with pro mateo um and we've seen that in

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,719
with project owl and so in 2020

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,240
um we have five finalists so before i

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,519
tell you who the winner is i want to

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,080
dive a little bit

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,720
deeper into some of our top wedding

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,000
teams

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,160
so in fifth place we actually

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,320
have team offship there were a team that

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,000
was located in canada

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,040
and they created a browser extension to

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,399
monitor

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,519
um shopping baskets and eliminate

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,600
carbon footprints uh based on weight and

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,959
distance traveled and they really went

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,120
after the

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,040
climate change challenge and they

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,920
actually won ten thousand dollars

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,080
as part of a uh winning one of the fifth

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,880
place uh finalists

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,920
and in fourth place um school listed she

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,040
really went after

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,680
the um the coven 19 challenge

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,440
and i think you know i want to say her

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,120
one of her inspirations was remote

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,080
education which was one of our big

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,800
themes for

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,839
for pokemon 19 but her tool was really

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,200
interesting

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:40,480
where she actually built a solution for

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,040
parents of um of students that

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,800
are in remote learning to make it easier

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,440
for them to understand what their

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,160
what their children's um assignments are

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,920
and what

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,600
they're doing just to help us all

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,560
especially parents who are

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,279
are working with um children we're now

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,920
acting as

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,880
teachers as long along with being

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,240
parents as well

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,440
so um she won our fourth place prize

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,480
uh third place is team safeq and this

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,160
one i find

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
very very interesting because it was

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,680
actually deployed um

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,600
in in real world so uh especially in

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,880
this time where we're all getting in

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,920
these long lines

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,880
especially to go shopping and

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,279
um you know you know get go out to eat

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,839
or

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,360
you know get get just basic supplies

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,399
there's a lot of

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,560
you know exposure that is there just

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,360
being in long lines especially with

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,880
people

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,600
and so safeq really aim to make that

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,040
mitigate that issue by creating these

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,440
digital cues

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,600
so you can wait in your car and be in

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,240
this digital queue and actually

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,040
go to your grocery store store or

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,240
whatever

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,720
um because you're in a digital line and

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,839
you're

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,920
avoiding social interaction there

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,120
so this was really interesting because i

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,000
think they implemented

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,800
this solution at a waffle house recently

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,160
and so

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,079
you know you can definitely check out

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
the blog and to learn more about the

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,760
solution

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,640
you know even if you're interested in

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,200
using

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,240
this solution for any any local business

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,640
it's definitely

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,200
um one that's really cool and then

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,800
finally the second place winner

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,240
was uh given to business buddy who

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,760
was who's uh we're trying to create

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,560
a um a solution for small businesses

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,440
facing economic destruction because of

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,720
kovid

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,880
and they wanted to create a one-stop

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,839
shop that delivers personalized and

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,640
responsive updates to small

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,680
businesses and they created a my buddy

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,880
chatbot

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,920
um to basically provide a pin board for

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,480
business owners

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,680
um about useful information such as

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,480
loans and grant

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,519
eligibilities and so this team actually

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,560
came right out of

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,959
australia and all of our

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,839
teams kind of have been from all over

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,279
the world

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,880
and finally our winner this year

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:14,320
was team aggerly and so aggra lee

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:18,720
is our 2020 global winner

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,839
and their solution aims to

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,560
uh assist small partner um small farmers

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,720
particularly in emerging countries who

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,360
are suffering from reduced crop yields

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,920
and other

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,959
impacts of climate change so their

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,240
solution

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,120
you know has been one that

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,040
is actually very interesting in

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,760
especially with the impacts of climate

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,160
change

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
and since they won they actually are

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,920
going to be

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,639
awarded the 200k prize as well as

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,600
the support from ibm to actually make

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,639
their solution

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,399
a a reality so maybe

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,079
next year you will definitely see more

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,120
information about aggravally

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,760
in the upcoming space because um

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,040
their solution really drives to help uh

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,880
help farmers

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,160
and so there this winning solution was

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,399
built by a group of

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,320
pace university students everyone has

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,560
diverse backgrounds from

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,720
um someone being from taiwan brazil

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,000
mongolia and india

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,240
and a i really really aims to

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,560
fill the information gap so that farmers

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,639
with less resources available to them

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,120
can make more of an educated decision

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,160
and obtain the necessary financing

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,680
to improve the economic outcome so

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,600
these guys really went for the climate

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,600
change challenge and climate

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
definitely has such a big impact

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,320
especially on the farmers

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,639
i hope everyone is back um i was just

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,040
talking about our winning team aggro lee

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,079
who

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,480
won uh the 2020 call for code and

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,160
how their solution aims to help farmers

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,519
fight climate change

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,959
and so they have actually used quite a

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,399
lot of ibm

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,320
cloud resources such as ibm cloud

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,240
object storage what's in studio watson

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,800
assistant and the weather company

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,079
so you know i'm not going to go deep

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,880
dive into their

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,440
um architectural diagram but what they

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,440
really

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,199
aim to do here is take a lot of their

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,880
weather api data

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,880
weather data along with

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,959
their food resources data and

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,480
try to build long-term forecasts for

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,959
farmers to kind of

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,680
understand what their weather risks are

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,399
especially when they're

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,920
you know going out and trying to yield

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,680
some crops so

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
it's it's a really really amazing

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,600
solution i would encourage

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,279
those of you who are interested in our

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,800
2020 winners to

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,199
check out this team check out the

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,760
solution one of the most wonderful

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,079
things about call for code that i find

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,839
is that it brings people that don't know

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,519
each other from different countries

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
come together to work and build

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,920
solutions that

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,320
really can change the world so this this

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,199
is completely representative with this

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,839
team

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,720
and um you know feel free to definitely

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,480
check out their

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,639
their solution the one big thing that we

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,519
are actually john and i are here today

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,360
is actually

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,639
to talk to you guys all about the

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
culprit code um

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,560
for racial justice so i talked to you

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,040
guys all about some

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,959
how call for code has these themes and

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,320
the golfer code for racial justice is

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,199
one of the most pressing

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
themes especially during this time and

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,800
so

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,519
ibm has kind of taken on this challenge

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,120
to

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,720
to bring light to this specific issue

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,360
and and build encourage developers to

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,160
focus

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,480
on building for the specific issue and

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,759
so

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,560
there's actually three focus areas

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,759
um the first focus area is police

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,959
judicial reform

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:58,399
and accountability um they

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,759
they're you know which aims to kind of

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,079
you know from traffic stops to arrests

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,600
using technology to better analyze

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,000
real-world data and provide

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,040
insights and that's in the space then

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,399
finally diverse

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,480
representation which which aims to

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,079
leverage technology to detect and

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,480
remediate bias

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,079
and then finally police legit um and

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,360
legislation reform

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:28,320
which uses which utilizes technology to

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,880
analyze and form and develop policies

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,199
for public safety and legislation so

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,320
these three are the big three themes and

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,360
john's gonna dive

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,800
into these three um specifically and

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
kind of

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,880
tell you guys all about what what we at

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,680
ibm are aiming to do

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,880
um to create this ecosystem and how we

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,480
can use your help

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,920
so if you're ready to do your part

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,959
definitely

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,839
join ibm call for code and you know

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,480
check out our

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,480
open source

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,240
projects and this is where you can get

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,279
started and kind of

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,079
be part of our ecosystem and with that

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,120
said i'm gonna

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,000
hand it over to john to kind of um

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,799
uh share more information on on the open

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,880
source piece

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,240
thank you puja so i'm delighted i'm

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,839
gonna take uh

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,839
if you give me control

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,160
so i wanted to spend a moment and say

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,880
congratulations to

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,440
that uh the team that won the call for

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,520
code 2020 last week so

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,679
i'm really delighted that project agroli

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,919
and all the finalists and all the teams

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,080
we had thousands and thousands

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,080
of entries so think about you know

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,120
climate change and coven 19

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,480
both both important really hard

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,919
problems and from a tech for good

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,880
platform perspective ibm just asked the

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,840
question

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,160
and we had such a tremendous response

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,320
from developers around the world we saw

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,799
some amazing solutions

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,440
and so i i was really impressed as a

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,480
judge i

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,360
got to see quite a few of them as a

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,000
mentor

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,480
i got to help quite a few of the teams

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,120
and

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,480
and i'm just inspired by developers and

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,280
what they can build

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,240
when you give them a platform and a hard

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,120
problem

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,200
and the ability to go and and really

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,120
lean in and make a difference

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,720
and so so that's sort of the core of

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,400
what call for code is

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,360
into ibm developer with our partners um

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,039
with the david clark cause and the call

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,280
for code platform

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,200
really is an opportunity for for you as

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,440
an open source developer and

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,559
and its partners to really come in and

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,280
make a difference in

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,880
and actually improve things and so as

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,320
part of that

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,960
it's not just can you win 200 000

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,080
it's it's can you go and build a

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,039
solution

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,840
then take it to the community actually

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,360
deploy it

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,480
with us with ibm mentors with the linux

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,200
foundation

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,160
with the open source community embracing

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,039
that

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,320
and and really building the solution so

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,880
we've actually

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,160
now just no as puja mentioned this is

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,000
year three

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,440
we've had some amazing projects in the

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,760
first two years and

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,880
others and so there's a number of open

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,200
source projects

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,400
that we're just encouraging you to to

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,360
come and join

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,840
you don't have to necessarily join the

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
you know

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,080
all of them just pick one that's your

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,720
interest i've been helping a team

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,000
in mexico they built an earthquake early

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,760
warning system

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,880
and so um andy mera with who is the

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,080
founder of grio he's got a set of

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,480
sensors

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,200
and an opportunity to go change the

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,320
world

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,039
and warn people that an earthquake is

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,600
possibly

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,640
heading their way and so a great setup

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,840
so if you're a

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,799
an iot person if you want to do data

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,799
analysis

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,720
great opportunity to come and help and

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,840
there's a whole variety of others

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,039
the 2018 winners actually have created a

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,600
protocol called

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,960
the cluster duck protocol and so you can

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,039
go and contribute

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,520
to that we've built solutions with

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,400
drones down in puerto rico

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,600
we've built solutions using the weather

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,559
company data

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,159
so there's a quite a few of projects now

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,120
available in github

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,960
in the call for code repository you

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,919
heard about a few of them there

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,520
project pro mateo last year's winter

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,720
2019 winner

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,280
the um they built a a

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,320
set of sensors that you would attach to

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,080
a firefighter

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,720
turnout coat and get all the chemicals

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,400
and environmental conditions that the

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,200
firefighter was exposed to

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,760
as they tried to fight wildfires uh so

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,000
it's a really amazing solution there

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,600
we're here today to talk about call for

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,520
code for racial justice

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,039
it's the next step in our challenge to

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,840
to engage the open source community um

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,200
and go and make a significant difference

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,880
so towards that end

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,480
earlier today uh some of uh willie

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:22,000
tajada our general manager for the

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,760
developer ecosystem group and alvaristis

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,520
bonsa who's our ecosystem

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,000
for cloud general manager announced the

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,640
call for code for racial justice and it

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,679
started

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,400
actually three months ago as part of

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,600
ibm's

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,559
internal response to the the

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,200
tragedies that we saw happening in

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,799
america

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,080
around uh violence to police violence

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,520
uh targeted at the black community

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,880
and and so there was a

00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:00,559
up as as society did there was an

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,240
over number of ibm black community that

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,280
stepped forward and said we can use

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,159
technology

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,120
to make a difference and so we started a

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,760
journey

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,400
a whole variety of internal teams to

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,960
build

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,640
a couple of solutions and today we're

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,559
announcing five of them

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
and i'm going to talk about the five

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,880
that we're announcing

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,520
we've got a whole pipeline of solutions

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,720
that we

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,799
we think with your help can really uh

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,880
improve the lives of of the black

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,400
community and so the first project is

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,640
called five fists voter

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,600
it's a it's a web application that

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,440
empowers

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,000
the black community and and other

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,280
minorities to to use their vote

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,039
to to actually uh stand up and

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,360
and vote to what they uh

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,240
for candidates that they think can help

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,200
promote their

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,840
uh equality and social justice and so

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,120
it's a

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,200
so it's great apple i'm going to show

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,840
you dive into the code show you their

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
example

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:03,280
app and it's really about connecting

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:06,559
that community so they can successfully

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,120
use their rights on november 3rd

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,919
the next solution is called uh legit

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,720
info

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,799
and so the idea with this particular app

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,320
again a web application

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,039
is is there's all sorts of legislation

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,240
at the

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,559
community level in your town in yours

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
in your county in your state in your in

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,720
a federal government

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,440
that affect you right in a variety of

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,080
ways

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,280
and so you want to become informed and

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,840
educated

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,880
about the solutions and so in this

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,919
particular

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,120
app goes and grabs all the information

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,000
and presents it

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,960
to that activist so they can become more

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,159
informed

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,880
about their the legislation

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,480
that could impact them the next solution

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,760
is called the incident accuracy

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,080
reporting system

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,000
and so it's interesting about this

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,440
solution we we want

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,679
to to use the police reform

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,320
uh momentum to bring more transparency

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,799
to the entire system and there's a great

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,679
opportunity to use blockchain

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,880
and so if we could capture those

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,600
incident reports

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,039
capture the testimonials capture the

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,559
police

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,720
report in a blockchain we know that

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,320
once it's written to the blockchain it's

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,640
an immutable record

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,640
and so we can bring more transparency to

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,559
those solutions and we'll show you

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,960
what the team built with blockchain

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,000
there the next solution is called open

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,640
sentencing

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,760
and so if we if we look at what's

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,279
happening

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:46,240
in america very often um

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,120
if you're in a minority group you might

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,400
not have

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,960
the same uh representation you you've

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,880
you've got a public defender and we want

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,400
to give that public defender

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,559
better tools to help them

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,679
represent our clients in the best

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,159
possible way

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,240
and so we want to make sure that

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,240
systemic racism is not

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,080
leaking into the the us the sentencing

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,679
that's that's happening and we the

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,039
statistics are showing

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,919
that black people go to prison

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,559
and for a longer amount of times than

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,200
than

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,080
what statistically should be represented

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,440
there

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:30,799
and so using data we're able to show

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,600
um what the right set of of

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,880
guidelines would be the last solution is

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,760
called trust loop

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,600
so again as you learn about legislation

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,120
as affecting you

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,960
you might want to um

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,720
have a voice you've got a voice and so

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,240
in the past you used to write a letter

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,679
to your congressman or to your

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,760
representative and you would

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,880
explain whether you were for or against

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,400
a particular

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,080
position in that legislation and maybe

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,000
you went to a public hearing and you

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,760
stood on a really long line and you got

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,400
to the podium and you had two or three

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,159
minutes

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,440
to express your opinion to the

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,360
representatives

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,000
and and hopefully they were taking notes

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,000
and listening well that's certainly not

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,039
what this in the world we live today

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,960
with with smart phones and tick tock and

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,520
and we're all expressing ourselves in

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,559
video and on these social platforms

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,760
wouldn't it be better if i could if i've

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,159
got a position

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,400
about a particular uh piece of

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,200
legislation that's going to affect me

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,159
or maybe affect you as a as a person of

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,039
color

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,960
you want to record your position and get

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,880
it to that representative

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,880
in a past it would be great i would send

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,440
a letter and maybe you get back a form

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,679
letter

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,080
wouldn't it be really better for them to

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,600
hear directly from me and from you

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:53,200
about legislation in their district

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,200
from their voters and so trust loop

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,039
gives you an opportunity to do that

00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,720
record your testimonial

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,880
and get that to your representatives so

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,600
since we put these all out in open

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,960
source they're available in github

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,840
and so so you can go and come and read

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,400
about

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,200
uh call for code for race or justice on

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:19,120
developer.ibm.com

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,520
go down to the racial justice challenge

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,399
and and join us because this is not

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,520
about winning

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:28,159
money this is about really making a

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,360
a change in society and we think it's

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,000
the right time

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,080
to have this conversation with the open

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,880
source community with you as a developer

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,399
you've got so many skills that you i

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,840
mean me i'm a developer

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,279
i don't i don't know but i know how to

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,760
code

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,840
and i can help and i'm passionate and i

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,200
think many of us

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,399
feel that way we saw this as a this kid

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,399
go on

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,799
um it's a great opportunity for you to

00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,000
come and join us and make a difference

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,880
so we've got the three areas that puja

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,520
mentioned

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,880
uh the police and judicial reform and

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,000
police accountability

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,399
diverse representation and policy and

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,520
legislative reform we built these five

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,520
solutions

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,520
we've got a couple of tutorials and a

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,360
whole set of git repositories

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,120
that come that you can come and engage

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,240
us with to really

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,600
uh combat systemic racism we want to

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,600
build ecosystems

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,799
around each of these projects we want to

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,120
invite you in

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,080
to come and help us make them better

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,640
these are solution

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,520
starters they're not endpoints we want

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,880
to engage

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,520
our partners and

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,120
the community how to build better

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,360
solutions and deploy them

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,120
all with the help of excitation and the

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,320
david clock cores and

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,480
ibm of course and so um

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,760
these particular projects i'm going to

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,880
show you in a moment that

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,360
we've got videos about each of them

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,159
we've got a tutorial and a how to

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,120
contribute

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,919
to read the contribution guidelines and

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,360
so you can come to

00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,520
developer.ibm.com to learn more

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,640
about each of the solutions and how you

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,640
might engage

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,080
we know they're not finished and matter

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,720
of fact we've got

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,080
github issues if you want to contribute

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,440
as a developer to

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,080
october you can come and start to take

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,960
off

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,240
some of the the github issues that we've

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,360
created we know

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,279
that we want to improve upon so go to

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,200
take a look at the videos

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,039
and learn more about the solutions but

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,159
let's go do it now let's let's spend the

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,000
next couple of minutes

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,679
so you can come and talk to us we've got

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,679
a slack community if you go to

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,279
slack get yourself an automatic invite

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,559
to the

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:49,279
to that slack workspace we've got five

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,840
different channels now that you can jump

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,240
in

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,320
racial justice uh and for each of the

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,039
project five fifths voter incident

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,760
account accuracy reporting system legit

00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,840
info

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,600
open sentencing and trust loop so jump

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,159
in there and start to

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,520
have a conversation with the developers

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,399
of each of these comm

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,000
projects all right so now you want to go

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:17,120
learn more so go to github.org

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,240
and to github.com

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,440
call for code for racial justice and

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,720
start to learn about

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,200
the projects now there's five

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,720
but each some of them have sub projects

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,320
so there's actually more than five

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,159
repositories here

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,840
so we'll let's go talk about a few of

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,399
them so let's go to the first one

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,720
it's called five fifths voter now

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,799
remember

00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,640
225 years ago that the founding fathers

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,200
got together and wrote the constitution

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,679
in

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,559
sort of an amazing document but it's a

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,120
living

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,320
breathing democracy and they made some

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,960
mistakes

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,600
in that document and one of them was to

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,039
count

00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,240
the s slaves in the south as

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,279
three-fifths of a person and we all

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,320
celebrated

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,919
when the 13th amendment right after the

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,679
civil war

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,840
made everyone's vote equal and so

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,960
i think this particular name of this

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,080
project

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,360
israeli telling it's five-fifths voter

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,080
the because we want everyone to to vote

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,760
have an equal representation and so that

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,720
the project itself

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,799
is a solution starter that goes and it's

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,120
built by a team from ibm and from red

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,360
hat

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,919
was really great to collaborate with the

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,600
red hat team across many of these

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:41,279
um so we talk about making sure that you

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,320
get to exercise your right as a us

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,120
citizen

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,640
we've got a great video here and a story

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,919
in an architecture

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,919
and i'm going to actually show you the

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,640
demo because i think this really makes a

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,279
difference

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,320
that the demo tells you most of the

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,720
story right here

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,799
we took a set of data sets from a

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,919
variety of places

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,440
um we mashed them up using some ibm

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,760
technology and some open source

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,640
technologies that uh

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,480
end with the help of smart ibmers and

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,840
smartredires and now

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,600
you to go and make them better and so do

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,039
take advantage of the getting started

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,360
docs here uh the contribution guidelines

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,640
and and you know jump in we've got some

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,799
suggested

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,880
open issues that that you can come and

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,799
help us fill out

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,600
so let's go take a look at this puja

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:35,120
because the app itself

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,640
um so we want to get that that can your

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,039
minority communities to the pulse

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,000
we want you to be educated we want you

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,279
to understand the

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,320
issues we want to know um you know how

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,720
to register

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,880
how to find your polling place how to

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,600
get that ballot

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:58,320
counted and and so the tools itself

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,880
uses you know information from all of

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,880
the

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,320
various election boards around the

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,840
country to source that information

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:11,840
uh help you navigate the process

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,840
both before

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,679
you get to the poll that day what to

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,799
bring how to register

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:26,159
what you know get there successfully

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,159
and cast your vote okay

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,279
so it's really about education because

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,480
knowledge is power

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,600
we want to have everyone an equal

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,720
opportunity to

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,519
to make them cast their their vote

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,120
when empower each of you to go and

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,120
enable you to to do that

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,279
successfully so solution itself if um

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,120
it's of course a responsive design so

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,080
you you're seeing it on my

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,760
laptop but if i were to go to

00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,399
fivefistsvoter.com on my browse my

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,679
my mobile device it would render uh

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,360
successfully on my

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,360
on my on my phone so why vote

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,799
how to get there how to get connected

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,200
how to register

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,079
how to find your polling place all sorts

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,480
of data

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,119
that you can come and take a look at

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,760
here

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,800
team needs help uh we've got more more

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,359
work to do

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,240
but i really think important topic

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,599
especially

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,399
we want to get you to the polls on

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,960
november 3rd

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,599
okay the next project is called legit

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,320
info

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,280
and so remember that you know as we we

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,280
want to go and

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,359
and all of this legislation affects me

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,639
and affects you and affects us

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,280
in in very personal way we want to make

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,560
sure that

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,480
it represents my you know

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,639
not just what some representative thinks

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,679
or some special interest thinks

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,639
i want to i want the the

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,520
legislation legislators to actually hear

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,560
from me

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,960
and so this particular tool it's a

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,880
it's a python app it runs in ibm cloud

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,599
you can deploy it to openshift

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,760
ibm redat openshift on ibm cloud

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,400
uh we show you how to do that we've got

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,800
a set of tutorial here

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,359
on on what it is and how it works so we

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,079
we're taking the information from

00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:21,040
legislative scan

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,520
and they've got a database of all of the

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,160
legislation that's sort of pending

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,160
uh we we match it up with with your

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,960
interests so maybe you're interested in

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,920
environmental justice or criminal

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,880
justice

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,400
or um you know whatever your particular

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,440
passion and topic is

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,880
you can sort we've got a set of machine

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,960
learning tools that

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,000
helps you to extract the text out of the

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,720
legislation

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,520
and matches your interests with the with

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,240
the

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,240
the pending votes uh so it's really

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,520
about educating yourself

00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,800
about and educating the advocates

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,119
about the salute the pending legislation

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,320
uh because we don't want this to be a

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,880
dark room

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,599
set of uh past the vote in the middle of

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,200
the night

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,920
we want you to to be informed

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,000
and have a voice in in the legislation

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,800
that affects all of us

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,599
all right so next solution is called

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,240
incident

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,839
accuracy reporting system and this

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,880
particular tool

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,240
uh uses blockchain and so we built on

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,480
top of

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,680
hyperledger fabric it's an open source

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,320
project

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,920
run by the linux foundation and

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,200
hyperledger fabric

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,320
lets you write a record to an immutable

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,160
blockchain

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,680
and so it uses um both from

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,520
so let's go down to the orchestra

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,280
diagram because i think it can tell you

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,800
the story there

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,280
we've got it so you can use watson text

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,119
to

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,920
you you make a a

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,760
police report and you speak into the

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,160
phone or into the app

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,440
it records your voice it uses

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,320
speech-to-text

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,119
takes that maybe you've you you speak in

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,920
a

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,480
different language select your language

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,920
does

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,920
uses watson language translator

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,520
takes your transcript writes it to a

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,359
blockchain takes your video

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,800
writes it to a blockchain same thing

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,599
with the police reports

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,880
and the call to 9-1-1 all that written

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,359
to a blockchain

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,079
now it's an immutable record there's no

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,280
there's

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,920
full transparency and clarity to

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,200
um to it there's no suppression of

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,520
information

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,040
and and honestly we we get better

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,440
results when there's

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,200
the light of day and so if everyone

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,200
knows that the light of day is

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,240
is going to be shined on them they tell

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,960
the truth

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,839
and and so here this solution with

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,720
blockchain

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,720
can really make a big difference all

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,119
right moving on to the next solution

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,720
it's called open sentencing so we want

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,320
to make sure

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,280
that um someone who's been accused for

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,560
crime

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,079
is is has got

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,119
the justice uses the justice system

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,079
um so that they don't get

00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,920
taken advantage of and so this

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,119
particular solution helps

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,800
the public defender or your attorney

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,079
understand that the crime and the plea

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,400
and so it's actually a several

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,280
components to this

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,359
it's a front end and a back end it's a

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,040
machine learning algorithm

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,720
and i'm going to actually show you some

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,560
of these things right well i deployed

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,680
this one to my local laptop

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,599
also can be deployed to the cloud

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,119
and uh so let's go take a look so i've

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,320
got a couple of pieces there's great

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,680
video if you if you want to go watch it

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,920
um so we've got a front end

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,960
and a aggregator backend we're going to

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,320
use all the

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,480
sentencing commission guidelines

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,920
and some external data sets this

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,200
particular one is the

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,720
cook county georgia data set and we

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,839
build a model

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,160
that did basically based on this set of

00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:18,320
crime uh

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,520
statistics what your uh particular

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,599
uh plea should be and so

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,800
there's actually so i'm running so i

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,119
went and i

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,079
i forked the code down to my local

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,720
laptop

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,839
and i cd into those directories i did a

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,000
build

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,920
um and there's instructions in a

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,320
tutorial i'll show you in a moment

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,280
and once i start the app so i've got the

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,000
front end

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,800
and the bias detection engine now

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,880
running

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,640
so both of them are running and and i

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,920
can go and hit the end point there's a

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,440
curl end point

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,400
and it so based on this that particular

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,240
crime

00:39:52,400 --> 00:40:01,440
um case it would tell me

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:04,480
what what the particular

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,280
sentence should be okay and

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,839
and hopefully i get the equal

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:15,119
representation

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,119
uh systemic uh bias okay

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,920
we've got a great tutorial on

00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,560
developer.admin.com that can walk you

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,160
through that

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,800
let's actually go look at the front end

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,880
so the front end of this i could log in

00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,240
and i can go open a new case nominative

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,960
public defendant

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,400
defender and i'm going to go into the

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,599
information

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,640
about this particular person

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,480
and its armed battery and the charges

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,920
are drug related

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,720
and depending on the case

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,119
it would actually go and show me based

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,960
on

00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:54,480
statistics what the sentence

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,520
guidelines should be and i would expect

00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,720
that might my plaintiff or my

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:06,400
defendant would would receive equal

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:08,079
equal justice

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,160
all right so a couple of pieces to that

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,839
project open sentence model

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,000
we've got the ui the the back end

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,839
and the bias detection engine machine

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,400
learning model

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,319
all right and there's a developer.ibm

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,520
tutorial which you can go and learn more

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,400
about and so i

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,880
i followed this um and i built the

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,960
example that i showed you a moment ago

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,119
last project let's go finish this up

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,319
puja it's called trust loop

00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,359
and so i want to record testimonial

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,480
remember i told you about the

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,680
testimonial

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,160
for the particular

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,200
legislation i want to not stand in line

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,359
or write a letter

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,720
i want to send a video to my

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,520
representative

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,160
and so we we built a solution the team

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,160
here

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,839
did an amazing job they built a

00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,359
front-end mobile app

00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,599
it talks to a back-end runs on ibm cloud

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:05,599
can run on other clouds as well

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,599
it it writes the data to a

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,440
video streaming service in our case

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,920
watson media could be other

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,000
streaming services as well we've got a

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,280
metadata that's stored in a postgres

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,119
database

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,160
and and the team wrote a tutorial

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,760
that that you can go read about

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,040
and oops so you can go

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,280
and learn about legislation and

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,720
and make a statement to your

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,440
representatives

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,079
all right so that wraps up the call for

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,640
code

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,079
for racial justice solutions so i don't

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,200

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,079
