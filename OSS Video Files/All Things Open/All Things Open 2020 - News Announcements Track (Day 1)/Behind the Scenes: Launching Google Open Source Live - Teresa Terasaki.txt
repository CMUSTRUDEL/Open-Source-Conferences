00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,160
out

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,120
kubernetes is a container orchestration

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,560
flutter is an ui software development

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,680
kit for apps

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,880
firebase is an ui software development

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,639
kit for apps

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,680

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
platform

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,639
learning repository

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,320
on github and go as a software

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,320
development language

serverless workloads apache beam

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,000
executes data processing pipelines and

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,280
angular is a web application

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,759
framework i hope you are not as confused

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,160
as i

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,800
am by now but to support these contrast

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,680
projects

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,800
within google christie bona founded the

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,560
open source program office in 2004

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
he will be speaking at the keynote

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,880
tomorrow morning so you can hear more

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,000
about it there

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,560
over the 16-year history of osbo

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,680
this year may will have been the most

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,960
dramatic

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,080
what am i talking about if you live in

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,960
the bay area

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,880
march 17th was the day that the shelter

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,960
in place order was issued for

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,320
all of the residents including the

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,520
entire city of san francisco like the

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,759
left of the country

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,479
i rushed to the grocery store to stock

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,800
up on canned food and toilet paper

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,560
but of course the sheltering price

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,680
affected more than just

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,319
our grocery shopping

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,759
open source projects were also impacted

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:15,360
as productivity went way down

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,560
for example we saw a 38 drop in deity

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,560
court committees for

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,720
kubernetes projects and as you can see

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,720
other workflows dropped as well

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,960
on the other side corporations are

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,319
planning to increase

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,400
investment in open source according to

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,680
the open source program survey

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,160
conducted in may this year more than

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,479
thousand people in the variety size of

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,759
companies said that their organizations

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,560
are creating more

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:51,440
open source projects than ever before

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,479
the demand is high but the committee is

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,919
struggling

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,440
so we asked ourselves what can we do

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,440
for open source community

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
to understand what the community is

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,039
looking for

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,840
we took a survey at industry bets

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,759
we learned that virtual events were the

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,840
most popular channel for them

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,639
to stay up-to-date on open source

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,479
projects

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,520
oh it looks like robert he can't hear

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,280
me talking um

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,280
fly and do you think he can fix that

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,360
so we decided to make one we had to

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,080
launch

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,639
something quickly so we looked inside of

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,919
google

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,800
to find existing resources we could use

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,800
immediately

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,879
we have experts across a company who are

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,199
working on open source projects

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,919
we also have ready to use virtual

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,960
platforms

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,160
youtube live stream and google meet

00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:00,080
so we decided to combine those lee and

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,080
create the virtual community have

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,199
this is what we launched please welcome

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,199
google open source live

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,720
google open source live is a monthly

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,720
live event series where the open source

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,160
community can get together

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,800
and learn from open source experts

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,560
each event includes four sessions and

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
the live q a

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,080
be finished with an after party on

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,240
google meet

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,360
it's an opportunity to connect with the

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,399
speakers and

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,399
other attendees

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,080
there are three benefits the community

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,360
can get from this google open source

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,320
slide community can hear latest update

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,720
on the project from the google experts

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,200
new release tips case study and so on

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,160
community also have an opportunity to

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
ask questions

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,040
directly to speakers and solve issues on

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,240
their projects

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,560
lastly community can engage with experts

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,120
and

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,000
other community members in the library

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,839
environment

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,839
and share experience together

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,760
when we launched the community hub we

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,880
wanted to focus on three key values

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,880
real-time intellective and accessible

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,519
your time to liven things up

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,040
and engage the audience we always have a

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,240
live and see

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,279
throughout the entire event there is no

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,839
going back

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,040
no playback function until the event

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,399
ends

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,440
so this will help create an engaged and

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,440
focused audience

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,440
intellective is an important element for

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,920
us

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,040
we have a live q and a forum below the

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,600
live stream window

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,000
so that the audience can ask questions

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,120
during the presentation

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,320
at the end we conclude the event with an

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,839
afterparty with

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,839
a dj cartoon artist polls and quizzes

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,839
accessible all the sessions have

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,480
captioning

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,079
and we pay extra attention to the screen

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,040
layout to make sure

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,720
it's designed for easy viewing for any

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,519
audience

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,120
we also created guidelines for virtual

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,360
event accessibility

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,000
which we will release on our broad soon

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,399
because this event is online there are

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,800
no geographical restrictions

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,839
anyone can join from anywhere in the

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,519
world like

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:43,040
this event we also set the event time

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,720
at 9am pacific so that the majority of

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,200
our emea audience

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,200
and some in apac can join live

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,440
over the two events we have hosted so

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,120
far we had

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,600
attendees from more than 50 countries

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,519
and we were thrilled when they or their

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,880
audience satisfaction survey

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,800
gave us 4.6 out of 5

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,200
for our first event the live current day

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,399
for them was one of the most popular

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,519
activities

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:20,079
we sold over 200 labq and a

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,079
intellections throughout both events

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,399
during and after the events we saw lots

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,399
of attendees sharing their experience on

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,640
twitter and slack

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,079

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,760

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,320
person one

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,959
this time when we took a community

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,800
survey

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,959
at cubicon eu this august 62

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,880
of respondents said they would still

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,480
prefer to attend in-person

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,160
events next year why people prefer

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,079
in-person events

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,440
first i would love to hear what you

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,519
think and if

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,720
you prefer to attend the in-person

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,970
events

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,920
why

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,320
[Music]

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,480
what do you miss about in-person events

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,519
so here's a last question for you

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,680
tell us what you think in the chat

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,880
networking sergio yeah me too

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,000
um much easier to network and actually

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,240
talk to people

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,920
alec yeah i agree meeting new people

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,519
daniel yeah i miss meeting new people

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,240
although we are communicating things

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,600
through chat

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,040
i can't see your face um so it's

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,839
it's sad um yeah it looks like everyone

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,360
is um keen to do networking meeting new

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,800
people

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:38,560
that sounds about what

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,279
we expected um when we took a community

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,399
survey

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,279
we saw three main themes people

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
miss about in-person events the first

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,199
theme

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,000
is intellection networking is more

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,639
efficient

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,959
hallway talk is organic and you can have

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,519
spontaneous conversations

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,399
for some people all their team members

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,360
are immort

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,760
so events are the only opportunity for

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,199
them

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,160
to meet in person the second theme is

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,800
experience

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,160
you can feel energy emotion and

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,279
excitement

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,639
it's an unforgettable experience and in

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,079
person memories last

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,760
longer than virtual events you can also

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,800
explore a new country

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,360
or city and of course there is a free

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,959
food

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,800
drinks swag and after party

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:33,360
the third theme is practica practicality

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,120
you can interact with experts and get

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,839
help on projects

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,560
also it's easy to focus on the event if

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,519
you are attending in person

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,839
as you can see there are many elements

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,240
we

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,680
can't achieve with a virtual event

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,320
format

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,480
but we are continuously exploring how to

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,720
develop our google open source live

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,519
so that community members can get the

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,079
most benefit

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
if you are interested in please join us

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,360

um attendees that it kind of challenged

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,000
the

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,799
the bandwidth or the google cloud to be

uh that many people or is it

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
is it pretty robust enough where it can

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,199
handle

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,319
yeah it's actually robust so we don't

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,679
have any boundless

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,720

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,039
threesome to share a bit more but

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,720
after for the idea what have you done to

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,200
make people want to turn up

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,440
and unstructure time when the talks are

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,640
done how to differentiate against

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,280
other webinaries yeah i just um

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,679
talk about the cartoon artist but we try

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
to

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,600
bring in the live atmosphere and try to

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,640
bring in attendees

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,960
like what i have been doing that i

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,720
kept asking a question to the audience

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,240
during my presentation

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,440
uh chat is the only way um to do that

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,559
and this event platform but sometimes we

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,919
will um mute

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,480
attendees and invite them and introduce

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,840
them

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,200
um in front of everyone so we can kind

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,840
of have a community

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,720
environment and atmosphere it's very

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,000
friendly

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,600
