00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,379
thank you very much for having me I hope

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,990
this was useful to you the slides are

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,199
already here if you want to have a look

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,410

contribute and I'm happy to take

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,189
questions

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,380
Jim I hope that I actually sort of

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:35,070
addressed your question about more data

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,200
we don't have a lot of data that shows

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,300
that concrete the completely the

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,820
benefits Frank nagisa

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,000
research is one of the rare papers I've

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:49,649
seen that's so compelling on on that

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,360
effect and I love I'd really love to see

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,980
more here and wouldn't make my life

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,280
easier for sure be I'm sorry to jump in

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,739
here um what I what I would say is - if

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,570
if anyone watching and that has joined

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,519
us if you're aware of any papers any

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,790
research any data that might be

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,619
available share it with a group send it

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,260
to us you can send it to us you know

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,490
maybe a link or some reference to info

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:21,360
at all things open or we'll share it out

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:24,240
again post meetup post this event we'll

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,070
send out information to everybody will

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,600
include a link to the recording so you

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,460
can watch it again we'll include a link

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,780
tobe to your slides and if you want to

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,189
you know share your slides with us

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,930
you're welcome to and we can send out a

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,700
link on our SlideShare account as well

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:41,250
we can post those and what we'll also do

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,840
is we'll include links out to resources

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,840
that have been referenced meaning Vicki

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,470
brazzers book Jonah Bacon's book also I

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,119
do want to say Toby one of the books

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,680
that you referenced early in your

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,210
presentation the reason I stepped away

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,880
was it's actually Geoffrey Moore's

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,829
crossing the chasm it is and I've read

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,350
it you can see it's I've got my notes

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,149
here and I think it's a must read for

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,490
anybody in technology that wants to

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,689
understand technology adoption just

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,489
really fascinating and it's so

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,580
applicable not just the technology but

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,830
to other areas of life and other simply

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,810
of Commerce and business as well

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,000
it's one of the I think it's a modern

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,760
classic I think it's an unbelievably

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,650
applicable in relevant book so I wanted

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,330
to go get my copy while while I was on

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,050
the call last while you went off you ran

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,820
off I was wondering as soon as you

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,390
started referencing early adopters and

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,060
everything I said oh my gosh this is

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,380
this is a fantastic book so yeah okay

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,150
yeah no I think it's a great framework

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,860
to think about these these issues and

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:46,440
sort of see how yeah how companies move

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,330
in that space and also sort of see where

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,460
there's a huge benefit for companies I

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,400
want to be to innovate in that space and

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,230
actually really grab the competitive

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,390
advantage before the other ones do was

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,780
you know sit in that in that place where

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,310
there's not that many people yet so

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,480
really for me that's you know one of the

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,459
arguments for building a really strong

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,320
open-source culture because there's

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,900
you're not getting a competitive

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,940
advantage by relying an open-source

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,570
anymore right everyone does that right

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,150
yeah okay so to Jimbo rings again

00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,950
question in an in Jim stated that he had

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,570
to step away so he couldn't jump in and

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,550
kind of raised his hand and directly

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,920
participate but I'm against you the

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,570
question is we're on the lookout for

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,330
more statistics and more studies and

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:33,120
more data I'm aware of maybe a couple I

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,190
think that I will share again post-event

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,140
and then if anyone listening to this is

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,720
aware of any more we would love to share

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,610
those references and resources with our

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,290
with our community because I know this

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,630
would be extremely beneficial and if

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,880
anyone is interested in starting a study

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,590
maybe even getting something started but

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,590
might be looking for some support some

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,120
help some ideas please let us know we're

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,260
more than happy to help you out I think

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,360
it would be well worth your Urim effort

00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,670
yeah I was enough to help was it yeah

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,070
and then I think there was another maybe

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,400
another other a couple other questions I

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,769
think mark Hutchinson if Mark still on

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,980
Toby if you want to take it yeah let's

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,510
see I think mark he asked a question

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,970
about he said he'd like to hear more

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,790
about maybe not being quite so

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,410
opportunistic I'm not quite sure if Mark

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,460
still on if he wants to elaborate on

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,750
that question if he means you know

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,070
perhaps I don't mean to speak from our

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,230
anyway but kind of going back to the

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,060
early days it really was about you know

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,490
contributing getting really nothing out

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,680
of it you want to see at least that was

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,120
the perception and then it's maybe kind

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,440
of transitioned a little bit too no

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,060
actually there was a benefit and you

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,350
should get something out of it and I'm

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,210
not sure if that is what he means about

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,700
being quote-unquote opportunistic or not

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,930
maybe I'm butchering his question I hope

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,070
I'm not but if I am I certainly

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:56,130
apologize yeah I was wondering if that

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,590
wasn't also maybe going back to the

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,510
point where I said specifically about um

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:05,280
you know companies trying to be

00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:09,780
opportunistic using open source in a way

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,750
to really benefit but not give not be

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,470
part of the community and not be and

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,290
really involved and just try to take out

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,590
all of what they could write so I'm not

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:25,470
sure which of these these two different

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:29,880
ones let me try to address them both

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:34,790
separately if we're talking about open

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:37,260
source in general and and you know a

00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,450
shift from like the early days and sort

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,450
of the ethos around open source to this

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:46,320
much more mainstream much more business

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:50,700
driven to some degree at work on open

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,580
source I mean you know anyone that's

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,850
been there for a while will have some

00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,690
form of nostalgia and regret for those

00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:04,050
earlier days but at the same time it's

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:07,500
sort of part of the normal arc of

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:11,070
something becoming mainstream as as more

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,500
people get to see the benefits as more

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,690
people want to see the benefits as more

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,190
people want to participate in this

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:26,130
community obviously you will you will

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:28,620
see all of them you know some some more

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,169
clearly opportunistic behavior as well

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:35,100
let's say some more organized behavior

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,750
right I didn't start open-source with

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,669
the help of making a career out of it

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,160
that happened completely accidentally

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:44,280
right but it was

00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,260
easier back then than it is today you

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,730
know if you take JavaScript like when I

00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,670
was first of all most JavaScript for

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,220
example like you know I became one of

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,230
the best JavaScript developers in the

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,030
world really quickly because there was

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,090
no comparison competition at all right

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,310
if you compare that to today there are

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:07,440
literally I mean probably a million

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:10,040
JavaScript developers 95% of whom much

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,080
fitter than I am at this point right so

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,990
you know given that if you actually want

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,490
to sort of leverage the same benefits um

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,460
you you have to be sort of more

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:30,210
organized and more intentional about it

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:33,540
I believe then the other aspect is yeah

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,570
about precisely participating in the

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:39,630
open-source community as a company and

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:42,300
trying to just to grab what's useful and

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,650
not being part of it not being really

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,930
involved with it

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:53,220
I think um it this gets really obvious

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:56,790
to people outside and if when you do

00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:59,580
that you actually don't really reap the

00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,590
benefits right you just it just feels

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,380
like that's what you're doing but if

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:07,050
you're doing that if you're being

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:11,460
involved just to get what you want out

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:14,250
of it and not have the project in mind

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,220
for example or the overall community in

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,460
mind it shows it shows really quickly

00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,810
and it backfires so I I think that's

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,080
that's really what I wanted to say about

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,510
this is if you're doing it do it for the

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,990
right reasons even if those reasons

00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:36,140
humble are sort of like underlined by

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:39,630
strategic benefits right um it's still

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,039
those two a compatible those are hard

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,169
questions I'm sure I'm sorry I'm I'm

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,910
trying to to do that to give them like

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,690
the my best shot but they're hard

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,690
questions to answer

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,010
okay are there any other any any other

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:58,330
questions there was actually one for me

00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,860
in the chat stream and it was I think

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,320
from GRE and he's asking why aren't we

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,360
using an open-source alternative to to

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,730
zoom which is a really great question in

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,120
the process of answering that right now

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:13,060
so Gerry the answer is on the way very

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,500
short answer to that is we've looked at

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,540
open source alternatives they definitely

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,980
exist you might see a change in the

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,840
format and the platform that we use

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,970
coming very soon we'll make an

00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,060
announcement about that but in the short

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,410
term when we were kind of I'll say kind

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,520
of thrown into having to host more

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,830
virtual events we have gravitated to a

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,550
platform that I think most presenters

00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:38,230
are most familiar with but you know when

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,770
someone joins us as a panelist and then

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,570
presents often there's not time to train

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,160
up or look into a different platform or

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,200
maybe learn some different maybe a

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,140
different feature set specific to

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,330
another platform and people you know

00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,430
again they're very busy so they kind of

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:56,080
join us on the fly and you know a lot of

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,640
people are already familiar with zoom so

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,890
I know that's not the best answer but

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,270
that's probably being you know that's

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,160
just being very transparent and very

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,240
honest again you might see some changes

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,370
coming soon but we've certainly

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,470
investigated that and continue to look

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,380
into open source alternatives to zoom

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,060
for sure so and again I'll respond

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,210
directly to you and chat as well

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,860
Toby sorry I didn't mean to dress like

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,490
that but at least it's a great question

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,610
it was that it was it's a great question

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:26,080
it's not an easy question to answer to

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:30,070
because you know again like there are

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,480
trade-offs yeah there are okay so does

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,680
anyone else have a question Toby are you

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,780
seeing anything else on your end I'm not

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,520
but I must admit that I haven't looked

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:45,190
through the whole yeah the whole chat I

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:48,490
don't see anything left in the Q&A I

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:51,880
don't know but I don't think I'm seeing

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,380
okay well we want to be as comprehensive

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,530
as possible and try to address all the

00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,300
questions okay so all of that being said

00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,920
Toby we'll go ahead and wrap it up thank

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,800
you very much for joining us today I

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,279
really appreciate that look we love this

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,889
stuff

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,379
we love this stuff and it's so important

00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:09,910
to understand and honestly a lot of

00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:11,379
people don't understand it and I don't

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,300
mean that being negative I'm not

00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,310
throwing off on anyone or being negative

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,230
toward any individual I'm you know our

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,759
position is is it really is important to

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,519
understand what the value proposition

00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,620
here is and why companies and individual

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,209
you know at an individual level I

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,490
individuals who want to get involved I

00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,199
mean that is to us a starting point with

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,509
a lot of everything else that follows

00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:34,899
once you understand what you talked

00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:36,939
about today a lot more makes sense once

00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,589
you see Facebook in the react community

00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,420
and other companies you know public

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,790
statements and press announcements and

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,709
press releases and acquisitions like

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,050
Microsoft buying github once you

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,370
understand what you talked about he's

00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,350
seeing those press announcements

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,059
suddenly make a lot more sense you you

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,529
can make more sense of the world when

00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:57,879
you understand the topic of today's

00:11:53,529 --> 00:12:01,529
presentation it does and you know sort

00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:01,529
of going back to Mark's question there

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,970
being aware of why large corporations

00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,680
are investing strategically in

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,050
open-source is important right I mean

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,559
you can do something we regret it or

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:16,959
regret the old days but I think that you

00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,819
also have to know what's going on and

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,589
understand why companies are doing that

00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:23,379
today and why it's a tool like other

00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:30,420
tools um like other business tools

00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:30,420
really and not only the original ethos

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,339
I agree okay so in order for us to wrap

00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:38,559
up I'm one of them thank our sponsors

00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,660
again these companies make this possible

00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,509
without them we wouldn't really be able

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,720
to do this so again IBM matter most and

00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:48,819
I haven't I oh great great companies

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,420
again truly truly appreciate it I'm

00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:54,939
gonna share my screen one last time and

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,980
I'm just going to again ask you to

00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:59,319
consider the open source 101 at home

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,720
event on May the 12th again Toby you're

00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:03,730
speaking at that event so if people tune

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,209
in and register they'll hear a version

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,170
of this presentation I think I know

00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,759
you're going to change it up a little

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,699
bit and maybe even hit on something

00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,439
maybe you know tweak it just a bit so

00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:17,019
they'll get a little different content

00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:19,269
but again twenty four sessions presented

00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:21,160
by twenty world-class speakers nineteen

00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:23,350
dollars and by all means reach out to us

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,149
for scholarships we would love to have

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,889
you participate quick update on all

00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:28,300
things open still scheduled for October

00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,480
the 18th of the twentieth we're

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,519
proceeding as you know with it being an

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,660
in-person event a fully understanding

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,059
that things could change at any moment

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,300
we may end up delivering a hybrid event

00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:42,220
or solely an in-person event or even a

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,779
virtual event if things take a turn for

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,600
the worse and people just aren't willing

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:48,129
able to travel and you know cities don't

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,749
open back up so there are a lot of

00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:52,689
variables in play here I'm gonna show

00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:54,490
you the Ivan Daioh website again and the

00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:57,490
matter most website as well and then of

00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,519
course our friends at IBM who just do an

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,230
amazing amazing job they really really

00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,480
again a great job they've been very very

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,759
supportive of us I do want to think that

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,769
with all that said anyone interested in

00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,569

include your shipping address sort of

00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,499
hard to ship you a hat and or shirt and

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,360
not know where to send it so if you just

00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:23,740
include your shipping address we would

00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,179
greatly appreciate that a number of

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,579
people did this after our last meet up

00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:29,170
super successful and I hope everyone has

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:31,569
received their items in the mail they

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,069
should and if your on still on and if

00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:34,870

00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:43,420
again okay any any final questions

00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,830
before we go I'm looking at the QA well

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,940
I do see one last

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,860
Toby I don't know if you want to take it

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,130
anonymous attend engineering facilities

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,760
services career I'm happy to do so

00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:59,340
that's fine on your side well sure do it

00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:02,320
do it quickly I love so the question is

00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,180
you know I want to I'm an engineering

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,650
facility service carrier and I have

experience developing software tools all

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,280
using my job I want to transition into a

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,630
software engineering job what's the best

00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,980
way for me to leverage open source

00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:16,240
software commitment to work on my

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:18,580
portfolio the answer to that is pick

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,330
something that you like that you're good

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:25,210
