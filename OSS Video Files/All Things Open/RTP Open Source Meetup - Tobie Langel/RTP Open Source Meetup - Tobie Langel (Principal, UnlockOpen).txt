00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,529
today's topic is why contribute to open

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,390
source right in the subtitle - it is

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,580
essentially the strategic benefits of

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,660
contributing to open source and it's for

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:28,920
both corporations or businesses and

00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:30,810
individuals um so if we look at if we go

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,649
back in time a bit and look at the

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,649
original motivations of open source um

00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:39,809
um you know a few decades ago even

00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:43,079
they're very much intrinsic motivations

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,410
right a lot of them are around hobbyists

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,480
and hackers in the hacker and hobbyist

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,750
culture wanting to scratch their own

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,050
itches you know focused on building

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,440
tools for their personal usage and when

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:04,110
you have really reputation as a currency

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:06,930
right so the whole ecosystem is somewhat

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,030
well very different to what it is today

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,670
to some degree and what's also

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,049
interesting to note is that that's

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,210
painting was broad strokes

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:20,040
sure but practitioners or someone of a

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:23,009
homogeneous group back then and you know

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,570
if you compare that to today you can ask

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,549
the question what changed well pretty

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,000
much everything right we've had a

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,340
massive growth of tech it's it's

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,700
basically everywhere and you know that

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,049
you've heard the the famous phrase

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,610
software is eating the world which has

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,610
also been changed to say while

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:47,399
open-source is eating the world you know

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:50,850
so really software and open-source moved

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,869
from this really fringe thing to

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,070
something that is completely mainstream

00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:59,460
and we can say the same about the

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:03,180
adoption of open-source right if we look

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:07,340
at how companies have approached

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,770
open-source over the course of the last

00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,860
one to two decades basically um it

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:18,090
started off in

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,500
hats hat tip to Taneatua rough for you

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,370
know coming up with this open-source

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,329
journey diagram that i modified a tiny

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,549
bit to work with this presentation

00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:30,750
open-source really started I mean sorry

00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:34,110
corporations started looking at

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:37,019
open-source sort of ignoring it right

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,640
it's not something that we're really

00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:41,069
interested in it's something that

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,859
happens for hobbyist this is it's not

00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:46,620
what business is about right and bit by

00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:49,140
bit moved in this journey from ignoring

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,750
to actually consuming then to shipping

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,349
shipping in products and realizing that

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,319
they had to comply to open source

00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:00,510
licenses starting to contribute and

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,970
finally really adopting the culture so

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,370
if you translate that in late person

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,540
terms if you're really having no it's

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,889
just open source that's for hippies

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,599
we're doing real business here right

00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,799
it's like really dismissive not taking

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,260
it seriously

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,870
you know it moves to well you know

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,090
consuming open source as well it's free

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,459
as and we don't have to pay for it right

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,739
not necessarily understanding the ethos

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,230
and the meaning of free in that context

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,660
so just you know let's use it

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,919
moving to compliant compliance where oh

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,389
there's a license you know maybe I

00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,699
should get a lawyer try to understand

00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:36,389
what's going on here um and again was a

00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:39,989
very sort of like not part of the

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,579
community aspect to it thinking well now

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,680
that I'm using this open source I can

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,650
just upstream fixes that's going to make

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,400
my life easier right so easier than

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,639
maintaining a fork and finally to moving

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,829
to real adoption understanding the

00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,329
culture and realizing that well no it

00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,859
turns out that the model of building

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:03,720
open-source software is actually much

00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:05,010
better let's adopt that too I mean if we

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,599
look at I don't know if you're familiar

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,190
with the technology adoption lifecycle

00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:13,949
concept but it's basically um the way

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,560
technology moves into an ecosystem right

00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,989
it tends to be first adopted by the

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,889
innovators which is a tiny fragment of

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:26,150
the whole ecosystem then you have early

00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:29,000
adopters which so it to be but more

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,639
what we call the early majority so all

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,290
of that nester the first half then the

00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:37,040
late majority and is finally the

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,990
laggards if we look at you know again

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,810
looking at this open source journey if

00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,320
we look at that what that means in terms

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:48,229
of open source adoption we can you know

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,120
move place that on this graph and have

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:52,370
an understanding of where we at right

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,919
now and sort of like in that journey

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,770
collectively so the data I have is

00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,630
actually for financial services but it's

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:04,130
very similar across the board across

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:07,100
different verticals so today when this

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,820
data comes from an interesting survey it

00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:14,210
is a firm called a black duck that's

00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:17,630
being purchased by synopsis sense but

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:21,190
that basically does compliance testing

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:24,830
during mergers and acquisition around

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,419
software a requisite reso it checks when

00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,090
a company buys another one and when

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:31,900
there's a merger it checks to see if the

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,639
actual software that's being purchased

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,860
has any copyrighted material in there

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,530
and then it don't notably checks for

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,880
open source and so they run these

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:46,190
records for this this reports on

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,139
something from about a thousand to

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,490
twelve hundred different acquisitions

00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,860
and mergers per year so it's like a

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,419
large data set and it turns out that

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:59,210
like in 2019 a hundred percent of

00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:02,510
financial services had open source in

00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:04,070
them and actually was consisted more

00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,960
than half of the actual software they

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,080
were testing and I think the number

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,630
across all verticals was 96% so it's

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,669
really safe to say at this point that

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,960
pretty much every company in every

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:21,860
vertical that touches software also

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:25,099
largely consumes open source now if we

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,770
look at compliance which is basically

00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:30,620
what happens when you start using open

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:34,070
source and software products that you

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,950
deliver right that's really the moment

00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:39,680
where it takes it can be earlier for

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,030
some other companies but in general

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,090
that's

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:47,350
it takes you realize that well overall

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,980
73% again that's in the financial

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:53,200
services but similar across the board

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:56,190
73% of companies on that's a different

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,340
survey 73% of companies are actually

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:02,590
effectively complying and so you know

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,200
utilizing open source in their products

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:08,790
and products that they ship well at

00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,690
least it's a good proxy for that um and

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,240
well when you start looking at

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,180
contributing numbers you can see that

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,080
that data really Falls and we're back in

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:23,530
swoon of the early adopter innovator

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,750
part of the graph right that's again for

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,750
financial services what's interesting is

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,980
if you compare it with tech companies

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,740
you'll see that tech companies are

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:35,890
contributing already a lot more you're

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,890
well past half half of the overall

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:41,440
ecosystem

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:44,260
okay sure graphs are nice but what does

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,490
that mean concretely for the problem

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,220
that we're looking at right now which is

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,430
um what are the money what are the

00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,260
motivations that you would have today as

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,410
an individual or as a company to

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,690
contribute to open source and for that

00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,640
again we want to look at the fact it's a

00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,040
very different context than it was two

00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,550
or three decades ago when we're looking

00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,100
at this much more French a much smaller

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,170
open source culture so first of all

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,390
software is everywhere have said that

00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,640
but that's really critical right open

00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,590
sources mainstream it's used but pretty

00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,040
much every company that's shipping

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,110
software or using software today it's

00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,420
widely adopted and used by corporations

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,850
so we've really moved from a culture

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,050
that was more of a hobbyist culture to a

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,260
culture that's much more

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,090
professionalized right and the other

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,630
really important factor is we've moved

00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:40,720
from a very small pool of developers

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:42,760
also sort of kind of homogeneous to a

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,160
huge and diverse population of

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,500
developers today right we're talking

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,290
about numbers which are in terms of 20

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,920
20 plus million developers in the world

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:57,869
right which is

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,160
quite huge frankly um and then the last

00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:03,629
bit which i think is also really

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,970
important is open source despite what

00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:08,339
you might hear is increasingly

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,459
professionalized right a number that's

00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:14,669
an interesting one it's again maybe not

00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:16,529
the most representative number it's 93

00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:19,139
percent of contribution to the linux

00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:21,959
kernel are done on the job by people

00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:25,230
whose job it is to write that code so

00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:33,269
we're it's a very different place then

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:34,619
it was again um a long time ago so what

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,910
does that tell us well it tells us that

00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:40,559
motivations have probably changed right

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,689
you're if you're a professional

00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,019
developer getting paid to build

00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:48,449
open-source um you might have some of

00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,779
them original values some of the

00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:53,850
open-source ethos but also maybe not

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,709
maybe this is just a job you do you that

00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:59,610
you're doing and it makes sense for you

00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:02,279
to do that so it's absolutely fine that

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,350
the motivations today are no longer

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:09,119
necessarily the same ones as they were--

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:11,189
um previously and so what I really want

00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:14,339
to do today is try to understand what

00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:18,230
those motivations currently can be for

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:21,179
both individuals and corporations and

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,730
for that I'm going to start with this

00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:27,660
example that I really like that helps us

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:30,299
understand the the byproducts and the

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,579
benefits of open source beyond just the

00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,949
code itself so I don't know if you're

00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:38,039
familiar with that diagram it's a

00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:40,860
process diagram that describes how an

00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:45,209
engineer does work right it has as input

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:48,169
a problem in coffee and the output is a

00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:50,939
solution to the problem and of course as

00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:52,410
everyone who knows who you know is every

00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:55,279
good engineer knows one of the

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:58,410
byproducts of this process is so chasm

00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,230
if you actually look at that from the

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,600
perspective of not like general engineer

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,459
but a software engineer you know there's

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,270
not a lot of difference the main

00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,920
difference is

00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:11,430
that the solution to the problem is

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,220
actually code you still have lots of

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:18,600
coffee as input and just as much sarcasm

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:21,470
as a byproduct now if we place this same

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,480
software engineer that we're looking at

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:27,570
you know that we had zoomed on and we

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:33,030
put that engineer in the perspective of

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:35,130
the broader open source ecosystem and we

00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:38,340
add sort of this pool of commons to the

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,230
picture um and look at what happens when

00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,420
this open source and when the software

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,870
engineer starts to contribute open

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,510
source code at first like this diagram

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,790
seems like very similar but what's

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,510
really interesting and what's key to

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:57,060
understanding the motivations and the

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,790
underlying value of open source is to

00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,460
see what happens when a second engineer

00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:06,060
comes in and contributes to the same

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:09,030
pool of Commons what happens really

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,680
quickly is that these two engineers that

00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:14,310
might be from very different backgrounds

00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,640
that are not necessarily anymore

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:21,810
working within the same company to

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:24,480
advance the same aspect of a particular

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,130
product to a particular project but that

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,620
comes from super different backgrounds

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,470
you can have a professional software

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,030
engineer and the student you can have a

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,950
professional software engineer and a

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,560
hobbyist you could have people from

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,680
vastly different cultures with vastly

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,840
different problems or trying to solve or

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:48,180
build vastly different products on top

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:50,760
of the same code um so what happens very

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,860
quickly an open source is you start to

00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,870
have interactions between these two

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,320
engineers that wouldn't happen otherwise

00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:01,170
uh they might be just code reviews right

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,030
someone puts a pull request and engineer

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,850
a senior engineer working on the project

00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:08,430
the maintainer starts reviewing that

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,560
pull request making comments so you have

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:13,250
like a whole code review pull request

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,410
code review process going on this might

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,720
yield to conversations in the issue

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,259
tracker on the mailing list about a

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,540
particular topic or

00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,369
sign decision you might even have an

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,970
increasingly projects have that a

00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:31,679
regular sort of face-to-face meetings

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:35,619
some of which even rotates as sorry like

00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:38,970
unknown like video conference some of

00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:41,399
which actually rotate to accommodate

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:46,109
contributors from different time zones

00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:49,169
on like on a weekly basis to discuss

00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:53,439
long-term design of the project or

00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:56,919
roadmap or particular particular issues

00:13:53,439 --> 00:14:00,489
for example um you might have mentoring

00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:03,879
going on you know someone deciding to

00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:05,549
really help a young developer better

00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,470
understand of part of the code base

00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:09,869
because maybe they want to have help

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,069
with that part of the code base

00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:14,229
obviously this creates networking etc

00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:16,629
right so there's this whole slew of

00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,979
interactions that happen between these

00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:19,899
engineers from very different

00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:23,529
backgrounds that wouldn't happen

00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:25,600
otherwise and what's interesting um in

00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,649
what's key to understanding what of a

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,629
fundamental value of open-source beyond

00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:35,049
or you know even more than the

00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:38,739
open-source code itself is to look at

00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:41,379
the kind of byproducts right again that

00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:42,879
these interactions create so jokingly

00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,589
when we're talking about sarcasm as a

00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:48,339
byproduct of software engineering

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:52,029
earlier but the open-source process has

00:14:48,339 --> 00:15:00,369
a lot of byproducts that are very much

00:14:52,029 --> 00:15:06,329
more useful than sarcasm um so those

00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:09,100
byproducts we can actually fill you know

00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:10,929
organize in in different categories I'm

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,299
actually missing a slide here which is

00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:15,669
which is why I but I'm a bit surprised

00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:17,619
the previous slide just showed all of

00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,720
these byproducts not organized and now

00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:22,979
they are right so I imagine they had

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,019
seen all of those my price not organized

00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:30,029
and so we see that the byproducts that

00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:34,150
these conversation creates help or are

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:36,970
beneficial to on a project basis

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,740
individual basis on a team basis and at

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,830
the organization at the level of the

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,630
organization so I want to focus first on

00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,040
the individual because that's sort of

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,040
where we started from from the

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:55,510
individual motivation you know so we see

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:56,920
that the key benefits that engineers or

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,160
developers that contribute to open

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,610
source are is well first of all they

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,510
level up on just the fact of having to

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:09,550
contribute code in the open and getting

00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:14,680
someone to review it someone that knows

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:16,900
really well and a particular project is

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,390
going to help you improve this is

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,730
basically the principle of learning by

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,130
doing you're actually just trying to

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,650
figure out what is it you have to do

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:28,390
you're putting yourself out there and

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,490
this is something that a lot of people

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,370
find very difficult to do at first and

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:36,360
for a good reason it's hard right um

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:40,920
it's also why it's important to have

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:45,120
code of conduct on projects and

00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:48,370
well-behaved and empathic and pathetic

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,910
maintain errs in senior engineers on the

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:55,089
project that help newcomers through that

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,640
process without making them feel bad for

00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:59,350
it well but the result of actually going

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,360
through that process is you really

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,360
quickly level up when you think about it

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,400
oh you can basically be taught for free

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,179
by some of the best engineers in the

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,670
planet on a specific project one of the

00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,679
other benefit of participating to

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:18,309
open-source is you learn about best

00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,589
practices early on and it makes it easy

00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:22,750
for you to adopt them because a lot of

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,270
the time open-source projects are at the

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,449
forefront of those so just by default

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:34,230
sort of the requirements around those

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:37,540
make you sort of adopters another often

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:40,270
missed benefit is it improves your soft

00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,700
skills a lot when you have a problem at

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:45,910
work with someone that's not doing their

00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,800
job or you have a conflict of some sort

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,410
it's

00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,960
easy to escape scallop this to bring

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,600
that up to your manager who is then

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,100
going to go discuss it was the manager

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,980
of the person are you having an issue is

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:04,500
none of that really works like that in

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,870
open sources if you want to get

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,470
something done you have to make the case

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,900
for it

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,060
you have to explain and why this is

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,520
valuable if you have a conflict you have

00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:17,100
to try and resolve that conflict was

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,090
that being able to force the other party

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:24,530
into a particular to solve a problem

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:28,380
through basically calling up your boss

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:30,510
um so that really helps them from soft

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,390
skills and helps improve all the skills

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,950
that you will need inside of more modern

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:40,710
companies to do cross-functional work

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:43,290
and work across organizations um what

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,470
this also gives you right as an access

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:51,210
to expert to an expert in network once

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:52,920
you start working was engineers on on an

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,690
open source project and you stopped

00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,100
being involved was it you stuck to be

00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,680
known in the community you know these

00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,160
people you can tap into their experience

00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:05,640
when you bump into issues on the job for

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,820
example it's you know who to talk to and

00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,400
and the best point is this network you

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,910
bring with you as you move from company

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,910
to company

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:18,270
it is not a network that it gets stuck

00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,940
left behind as you move on with your

00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:24,180
career do you take it with you across

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,670
all of the different jobs that you take

00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,980
whether or not it involves that project

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:32,280
and I mean personally I still bump into

00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,830
people that I was involved with in an

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,870
open-source project like over a decade

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,240
ago in a completely different setting

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,210
and that happened to me less than I

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,740
think yesterday or just oh there's this

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,300
person I know here this is extremely

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,340
useful I'm gonna it's gonna be way

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,650
easier for me to actually get something

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,890
done in that new project or in that new

00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:56,340
context because I have this network um

00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:59,520
and finally this gives you better career

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,840
opportunities right levelling up all of

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,179
those skills or

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:07,320
that that network actually translates

00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:09,419
into better carry opportunities and I

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,890
want to dig a bit more into this because

00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:15,320
it's something that's very commonly

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:19,289
brought up and worth looking at more

00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:22,710
deeply so open source is a carrier

00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:25,140
booster right a lot of people say you

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,620
get her profile as your resume or your

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,630
resume and I I know that this is

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,390
problematic to some degree and I'll come

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:38,000
back to that right but the fact that it

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:42,179
is problematic doesn't make it not true

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,510
and so being aware of that and trying to

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,549
leverage this as much as you can as

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:51,240
something that can really help boost

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:56,190
your career um there was a survey that

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,760
was done by github in 2017 where they

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,020
interviewed I think it was 6,000

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,320
contributors to open source projects on

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:06,149
github so these were all people that

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,520
were active and open on open source

00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:11,100
projects and over half of the

00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,590
respondents claimed that open source was

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,890
somewhat important or very important in

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:18,779
getting their current role right so so

00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:21,390
this is I mean sure it's a by a sample

00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:24,299
obviously but what it says is if you

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:28,610
invest heavily in open source it pays

00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:30,929
back in terms of your actual career um

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:33,570
one of the things that's important to

00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:35,610
note and that ties into the problematic

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:39,679
aspect of open source being such a

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:45,380
carrier booster as tank is already

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:48,149
generally a an industry where

00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,789
underrepresented minorities are really

00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:52,260
underrepresented right well it turns out

00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:55,289
if you look at data for this that's

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,840
actually much worse an open source than

00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:59,970
it is in tech in general so tech numbers

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,309
are bad open so those numbers are awful

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:05,460
right so I don't remember specifically

00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:07,770
the data for that survey but I think it

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:13,490
was under 10% for example from a gender

00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:13,490
perspective that were a non men right

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,860
so this is something to keep in mind and

00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:22,880
something that I don't get back to in a

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:27,580
couple of slides there's a couple of

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:32,000
things that you have to consider if you

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:34,580
want to go the path of using open source

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,800
as a carrier booster is you actually

00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:42,340
have to commit but you have to do it

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:46,820
seriously people spot really easily um

00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:49,310
drive-by commits in order to boost your

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,070
github profile right it's kind of

00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:54,560
obvious really quickly and it's not

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,140
gonna help you you know

00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,350
leverage and use all of the benefits of

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,760
open source I've been mentioning before

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,950
it's basically just gonna make your

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,780
profile look vaguely better it's kind of

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,730
like how you would decorate your resume

00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,130
in general you can do the same thing for

00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:14,090
your github profile and if you ask now

00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:16,430
any sort of company that's doing

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:18,710
sourcing or hiring oh they actually

00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:21,350
check for this right they know this they

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:25,070
spot it it's obvious and it's not going

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:27,380
to help so you really have to decide I'm

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:30,130
actually genuinely interested by this

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:36,200
project and I want to make the effort to

00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:39,320
be well well recognized what perceived

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,240
by a community I'm doing the speakers I

00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,370
like it but I'm also doing this because

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,830
I know that this is going to help boost

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,990
my career or kickstart it right

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:51,530
um yeah you know an example of that I

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:53,930
don't know the exact numbers of resumes

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,910
that Facebook receives on a regular

00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,190
basis but getting a job at Facebook or

00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:01,370
Google what those large tech companies

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:04,700
it's actually really difficult um well

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:07,910
when Facebook started react they pretty

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,770
much hired every cop contributor to the

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:11,540
project that they could find right and

00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,300
everyone that would actually create like

00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,490
a spin-off project or an outside project

00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:20,600
well if they could hire them they did

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:24,140
right so it's a way it's a way stronger

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,029
card to play if you want to have a

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,129
position in one of those

00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:32,539
companies then trying to go to normal

00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:36,529
brute lastly don't be opportunistic

00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:40,999
about it there's a it's not uncommon for

00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:43,429
tech companies out there to perceive the

00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:45,529
value of open-source and to be part of

00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:47,809
them have engineers be part of that

00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:50,899
system and so what some of these

00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:54,200
companies do and I won't name them is

00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:55,509
they actually put junior members in

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,249
open-source projects

00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:01,820
wait until they're leveled up in as soon

00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:04,129
as they are and that there are better

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,749
engineers and most savvy engineers they

00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:08,149
take them back and make them work on

00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:11,539
proprietary software internally right I

00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:13,609
mean this is again sure it might make

00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:15,799
sense in the short term but again this

00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:21,259
is this gets well-known in the industry

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:25,039
really quickly and you know this this

00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:27,349
will hurt your your ability to be taken

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,309
seriously as a company it will hurt your

00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:33,469
ability to actually routine engineers of

00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:36,710
argue ability to hire new ones so it's

00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:39,499
it's a somewhat really short term

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:42,649
strategy and a really stupid one long

00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:44,539
term so as I said you know one of the

00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:46,399
key problems that we have was

00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:49,820
considering open source as a carrier

00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:53,539
booster is that it inherently favors the

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,859
privileged and by that I mean that um

00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:57,080
for a long time

00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:59,479
as I said at the beginning of this talk

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,080
open source was really something that

00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:06,200
was essentially done on your own time in

00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:09,289
the evening as a sort of hobby Hat

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,109
project you would do in the weekend well

00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:15,469
it turns out that a lot of care work is

00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:18,799
done by women for example so it makes it

00:26:15,469 --> 00:26:20,839
really difficult for them to be to have

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,899
just the same access and can you know

00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:27,619
spend the same time on open source

00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:29,719
software that men could similarly if you

00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,940
come from a privileged background where

00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:34,580
you don't have to work when you for

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,619
example and you as a student you can

00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,630
actually spend your evenings instead of

00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:40,180
flipping

00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:42,460
burgers in a burger place I'll

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:45,790
continuing to open source and as such

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:49,260
sort of building your resume so this

00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:52,030
inherently is not really fair and

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:56,200
contributes to a lot of problems that we

00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:58,930
see in tech when you think that you know

00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,310
an open source presence is so important

00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:06,250
to get good good jobs and good rolls

00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:07,920
well obviously not having equal

00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:11,530
opportunity to contribute to open source

00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,360
makes it even unfair and contributes to

00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:16,480
this sort of like really big imbalance

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,890
that we have in tank that not only do we

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:24,790
have a few underrepresented minorities

00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:26,400
but they're also very much at the bottom

00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:29,470
of the ladder

00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,270
because they cannot level up right so

00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,550
how can companies helpful this well it

00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:35,230
turns out that if you're really

00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:37,210
professionalize open source and consider

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,190
it as something that you do on the job

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,040
that is part of your engineering

00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:46,000
practice right I am NOT suggesting hey

00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:47,470
let's have a Friday open source what we

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,990
contribute to open source projects

00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:53,470
randomly I mean that's still good I'm

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:58,960
really saying like consider the way you

00:27:53,470 --> 00:28:03,310
build software as mashed and and mixed

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:07,540
in was open source right um that has a

00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:12,340
you know a clear benefit for the because

00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:15,040
it brings in all of your engineers on an

00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,960
equal footing to be able to participate

00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,570
too and so it's just no longer something

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,160
that you have to do out of another job

00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,820
it's something that you can do one on

00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,350
the job right um and not only is it

00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,720
difficult for underrepresented

00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,180
minorities to find the time to

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,100
contribute to open source um there is

00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:36,190
also data that shows that when they do

00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:38,620
they have a harder time right for

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:43,570
example just having as your github

00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:47,710
avatar a name that's identifies you as a

00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:50,170
woman will make it harder for you to

00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,399
land poor requests right I know this

00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,009
sounds

00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:55,870
a bit surprising and unfair but there's

00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:58,419
again research that shows that that is

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:01,799
the case right so not only do you want

00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:04,630
to give under represented minorities

00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:06,820
time on the job you also want to

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:09,899
actually proactively help them

00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:14,080
contribute give them the space and

00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:15,909
really help that and lastly you also

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,710
want to have their back there's a really

00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:19,630
good example of a complaint that has

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,789
done that beautifully it's zalando

00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:25,899
solando actually wrote and published

00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:28,419
policy that not only their own projects

00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:29,470
would have code of conducts and would

00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:32,259
make sure that everyone is treated

00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:34,179
fairly and equally but also that they

00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:37,210
would back their own employees working

00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:39,399
in open source in the outside projects

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,559
that they had no control over where

00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,529
their housement issues or unfair

00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:48,539
practices so that's something that a

00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:51,460
company can I think really help was and

00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:54,009
what they can get out of doing so is

00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:57,100
basically increasing diversity at every

00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:57,700
rung of the career ladder which is

00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,759
awesome

00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,340
for lots of reasons that you know we

00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:06,220
could get into but we don't really have

00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:08,110
the time right now additionally this

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,529
will again help decrease wage gap

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:15,039
because the wage gap is tied not only to

00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:17,590
people being less paid depending on

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,740
their gender for example but also for

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,470
promotions to be more difficult right

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:27,600
and this well ultimately also yield a

00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,600
stronger open source culture

00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,570
I'm just wondering if before we go into

00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:36,799
the benefits for companies there is a

00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,059
maybe a few questions if you want to

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,100
stop for questions here around the

00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:42,500
individual aspect or I should just dig

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:47,740
in into the benefits for companies and

00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,740
then we can have questions at the end I

00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:56,270
see there's one question in the Q&A but

00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,160
yeah Toby I'm sorry about in here yeah

00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,500
I'm actually kind of monitoring the chat

00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,299
I don't I don't think there are any

00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,970
questions in the chat right now there is

00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:06,679
one Q&A Jimbo ring the college professor

00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:15,080
that I'd referenced earlier he does have

00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:16,370
one so that's it's a longer one but if

00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,900
maybe you want to read through that and

00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,220
take that or if you want to wait till

00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,100
the end you're more than welcome to do

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,630
that to like him I can actually take it

00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:30,200
it's just going to do weird things with

00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:31,940
my screen ah yes okay oh hey why why

00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,640
don't why don't I mean do you want to

00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,290
perhaps just save it save it till the

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,970
end and because we'll do kind of a

00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,620
comprehensive Q&A session that's the way

00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:42,320
that works that's great let's let's do

00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:47,510
it and I sort of address parts of it

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:51,679
later on in the talk okay so the answer

00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:53,450
is gonna be not as great as I think Jim

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,169
would have wished but hopefully not

00:31:53,450 --> 00:32:00,799
completed as emphatic let me let me get

00:31:57,169 --> 00:32:10,549
back to the deck right now if I find

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:13,100
where I was in the deck here yes yes

00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:19,160
there yep oh yeah can you can see it - I

00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:22,250
thought I was yeah obviously yeah so I'm

00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:24,020
gonna store it yeah so benefits for

00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,929
companies I'm gonna look at three things

00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,040
the second order benefits for companies

00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:29,390
so what we've been looking at for

00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,710
individuals but going back to the

00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,900
diagram and looking at that for

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,059
companies and we'll look at operational

00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:38,870
benefits of stronger personal strategy

00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:42,140
in strategic benefits so second-order

00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,250
benefits also known as byproducts and if

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,100
you're familiar was a

00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,290
the Apache foundation saying community

00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:51,440
over coned right it's all part of the

00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,630
same sort of like understanding of open

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,690
source which is to say well the output

00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:59,840
is important and valuable like the

00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,970
actual code but maybe the process in the

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,450
networks and all of those byproducts or

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:08,420
actually the key value Oh see this is

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:11,300
the this is the actual slide I was

00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,970
missing it's here which is perfect so

00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,950
you know we all of these different

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:18,050
byproducts we can organize we talked

00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:22,070
about the individual ones I want to

00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:24,590
quickly touch on benefits at the project

00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,540
level right an open source project or

00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:29,630
open sourcing a project that you have

00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:32,180
internally um tends to generate improved

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:36,200
documentation increased code quality

00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:38,300
lower technical depth right and those

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,020
are like huge benefits

00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:44,090
there's sort of an obvious thing that

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,850
happens to open source project just

00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,110
because you have there are different

00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:52,580
requirements as how you have to

00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:54,560
communicate there is the the audience

00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:59,210
has broader the stakeholders are more

00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,890
different and so you have to really you

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,140
know improve the quality quality

00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,650
improves the documentation improves you

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,850
also get like a better testing

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,680
continuous integration is sort of like

00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,370
tied in to this so you adopt all of

00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:15,080
these all of these best practices again

00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,970
that tend to create stronger better

00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,860
project that are more nimble that can

00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,960
move faster you increase development

00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,900
velocity for that project so it tends to

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,970
be usually very positive right and if

00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,250
you were actually involved with an open

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:31,160
source project that that's external that

00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:34,250
you don't own being involved will help

00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:37,310
you as an individual or sa company

00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,710
actually influence the project direction

00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:42,050
right that's true of open source

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,280
projects it's true of standards if

00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,880
you're talking about web standards do

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,250
being they're doing the work right is

00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:55,250
actually creative incredibly effective

00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:56,540
to create changes and move the project

00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:02,060
in the direction

00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:03,980
that better suits your own needs um so

00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,900
if we then look we've talked about

00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:10,640
individuals already if we then look at

00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:12,770
the team benefits right um in this gym

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,920
as well won't we actually I have a tiny

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:19,930
bit of data to share with you what we

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:23,660
tend to see are increased efficiencies

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:27,980
serendipity right so you know again

00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:29,600
bumping by accident into maybe a

00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,420
contributor that is working on a similar

00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:36,370
problem or that knows about this other

00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:38,600
tool that can help you that's you know

00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:40,910
closer to your needs or that can help

00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:46,490
you solve a problem so all of these sort

00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:49,340
of like accidental encounters that can

00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:54,500
really help you as a team be more

00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:59,390
effective um it's also where innovation

00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:02,060
happens and that's largely due to a a a

00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:06,320
concept called knowledge spillover which

00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:09,560
is basically the idea actually exam if

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:14,120
you look if we go back in time and look

00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:17,180
at what made Silicon Valley Silicon

00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:22,040
Valley it according to some research has

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:23,690
a lot to do was the fact that what what

00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,360
back in time there were basically two

00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:28,910
polls in the USA competing for sort of

00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,550
being them the mecca of silicon right

00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:34,910
it was Silicon Valley centered around

00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,680
Stanford and the Boston area in

00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:40,520
Cambridge centered essentially around

00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:46,000
MIT and turns out that the laws in

00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,000
California were much more protective of

00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:54,620
employees than they were in

00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:56,090
Massachusetts so basically California

00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,400
you could not have non-compete

00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:00,560
agreements with the employees and what

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,850
that created was basically engineers

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,810
that would hop from company to company

00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:07,670
as they were nowhere offered better pay

00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:10,210
or could work on more interesting

00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:14,630
projects or could have a high

00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:18,350
Macario pass and what this apparently

00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:19,910
created is a whole bunch of innovation

00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,770
through the concept of knowledge

00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:24,290
spillover which is basically while these

00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,510
people talked right it's not like they

00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,920
actually stole IP from their previous

00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:31,100
employer and brought it to the new one

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,470
but what they have learned on the job at

00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,420
company a sort of was transferred to

00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,400
Company B and when you do that at the

00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:41,300
level of like pretty much every engineer

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:43,010
at every company you see really quickly

00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,380
help you create well first of all you

00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:48,740
create a huge net a much bigger network

00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:51,170
much faster right um and that network

00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,970
shares information at a faster rate than

00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:55,430
it would if everyone is siloed in their

00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,950
own company when you think about it this

00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:01,280
is exactly what open source is doing to

00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:05,470
tack today right the same concept but at

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:09,290
world scale and across basically all

00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:10,340
open source software and if you think

00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,290
about it again

00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,300
open sources were all not of the

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:17,770
innovation and software happens today

00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,770
that's probably not by accident

00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:25,580
so um quickly what I want to talk about

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,560
here is I for what I actually have data

00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,720
around increased efficiencies I'm also

00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,210
checking the time what do we have

00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,910
roughly about 10-15 minutes a bit more

00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,859
for the presentation yeah yeah let's go

00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,780
with about 10 minutes let's take about

00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:41,480
one o'clock and we'll do five minutes of

00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:43,609
Q&A and then we can go over if needed

00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,560
and then we'll try to wrap it up that

00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:47,780
sounds good all right so in terms of

00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,369
increased efficiencies there was

00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:54,140
actually a really interesting research

00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:55,550
by Frank nag oh that's from 2017 and

00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,920
paper called learning by contributing

00:38:55,550 --> 00:39:01,430
that you can link that's linked from

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,980
there um where what effect angle did is

00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:06,859
he looked at a number of companies that

00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:12,200
were building software on top of the

00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:14,470
Linux kernel um and he showed that

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,790
companies that were effectively

00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:19,280
contributing to the Linux kernel were

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,740
actually twice as efficient at the

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,910
company level right they were actually

00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,039
making

00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:28,329
you know basically twice as much profit

00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:32,500
in it and you could really tie it down

00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:34,849
to the efficiency of the team's

00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:38,119
contributing to open source and he

00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:45,680
explains it by foot by two reasons the

00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:48,349
first reason is that the networks that

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,859
you've built as part of open source help

00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:54,680
you solve problems and bugs that you

00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:56,509
bump into way faster yeah if you're

00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,440
asking the engineer that's obvious right

00:39:56,509 --> 00:40:02,569
oh if you don't know a project just

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,329
solving a really silly bug can take you

00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:06,980
a whole week whereas if you know who the

00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:08,809
owner of that part of the code is for

00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,690
example sometimes it's just like you

00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:13,579
know a slack message or icy write to

00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:15,710
just say hey I'm bumping into that and

00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:17,839
and maybe there's already a patch

00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,670
somewhere or like there's an unknown

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,390
workaround and it takes you literally

00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,700
half an hour

00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,339
so this quickly builds up it turns out

00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,539
right and the other effect is and that's

00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:30,490
why the paper was called learning by

00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:34,069
contributing is um when you start

00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:35,900
actually contributing to a an

00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:38,779
open-source project you learn the

00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:43,069
specifics of it really quickly and as a

00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:46,099
result you level up and so you have much

00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:47,960
better engineers that become much more

00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:50,200
efficient in that create more efficient

00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,200
teams

00:40:50,520 --> 00:41:01,800
um so going back to that diagram the

00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,390
other data point that I have is access

00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,270
to town pool and basically for

00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:11,750
recruiting purposes right so when I was

00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:15,930
at Facebook and when Facebook launched

00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:19,290
react it actually asked its developers

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:22,170
its sorry its new recruits what had

00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:24,600
driven them to take the offer in whining

00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,490
you that was a time where Facebook

00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,290
wasn't dealing was sort of all of the

00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,850
backlash this feeling was it has been

00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:31,830
dealing with surround privacy it cetera

00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,690
for the last five years it was a time

00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:35,550
where Facebook was a hot new startup

00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:38,760
that was they had just IPO that that was

00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,680
about to do so right so everyone in

00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,510
Silicon Valley was every engineering was

00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,090
like yeah that was a really interesting

00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,740
place to go work for you know we're

00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:49,650
going less it turns out that despite

00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:51,390
that still seventy five percent of new

00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,150
engineering recruits it's like three

00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:56,070
quarters right mentioned the open source

00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,710
program as a key reason to accept the

00:41:56,070 --> 00:42:00,530
offer so even for companies that were so

00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,000
attractive for lots of other reasons

00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:06,150
having a really strong open source

00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,700
presence in a culture was something that

00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:14,369
was really important and lastly the last

00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:16,410
example I want to give is being

00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:18,960
perceived as an industry leader right

00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,609
which is also one of the benefits one of

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,470
the byproducts of having a strong

00:42:20,609 --> 00:42:24,450
open-source culture and this is an

00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:26,100
example that I love oh there was a

00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:28,460
company in Europe called trivago which

00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:31,980
is kind of a good bookings calm

00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:34,170
competitive competitor and so basically

00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:38,160
what they do is they sell travel tickets

00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:41,490
and hotels you know they were heavily

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:46,380
relying on web pack for their which is

00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:50,130
an open source are bundling for a front

00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:52,920
end code on the web and there were you

00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,900
know relying on it for their own web

00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,940
site and they had a bunch of things that

00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,670
they wanted to see improve in that

00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,980
software so they decided to fund it they

00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,730
gave it a hundred thousand dollars for

00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,010
year

00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,570
um hoping that the project would

00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:08,609
actually that would help the project

00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:11,640
focus on the key performance issues that

00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:14,490
they have so after a year the outcome

00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,830
was fascinating first of all the the

00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:19,380
work that they wanted to have done to

00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:22,680
see done had been done right and I had

00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:26,190
been done by you know one of the biggest

00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:28,080
expert on webpack in the world you know

00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,300
there's literally no way it could have

00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,300
had done that work in that amount of

00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:36,500
time for that little money had they had

00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:39,510
had they hired someone themselves had to

00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,880
train that person etc right so there was

00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:44,760
a huge win it was much more interesting

00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,609
is that as a result of just that

00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:49,859
sponsoring they became perceived in

00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:52,410
Europe and the JavaScript and front-end

00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:55,410
community as a friend of open source and

00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:58,350
they started to have lots of developers

00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:00,480
bang on the door to get a job after the

00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,740
first year they had hired for and I know

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,750
that then they actually run their own

00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,820
open source conference right so they

00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:10,200
really have like doubled down on this

00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:11,850
notion of open source s being great to

00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,410
be perceived as a leader and being

00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,890
beneficial to their company and for

00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:19,160
hiring purposes - all right I'm gonna

00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:21,560
run through operational benefits quickly

00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,940
common ones it's just paying back

00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,859
technical depth right through

00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,619
maintaining lots of Forks of open-source

00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:30,210
projects um because you have bug fixes

00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:34,020
and patches well it turns out that

00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:36,600
moving all of that upstream is actually

00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,900
a really good idea and makes your life a

00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,900
lot easier

00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:47,430
similarly when we have really big

00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:52,109
projects like browser rendering engines

00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:53,970
or it is pretty much the right

00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:57,960
operational decision from an economic

00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:59,880
basis to continue participating in the

00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,119
development of these open source

00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,940
projects rather than forking them and

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,260
sort of maintaining your own fork

00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,720
essentially because there is so much

00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,390
working so much going on that it would

00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,910
be impossible today for someone to

00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:16,890
compete and to start from scratch right

00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:19,380
so just like

00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:21,630
being part of the the open source

00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,820
community is basically the only option

00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,340
that you have here unless you have a

00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,340
massive amount of investment and are

00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:31,260
ready to start from scratch so the

00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:34,380
example here is if it's it's interesting

00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,180
to note that the rendering engine that

00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,250
we have today in like the most common

00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:42,540
browsers today the most modern ones from

00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:46,910
ie to you know to brave is a fork of the

00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:49,860
one that was WebKit in Safari in Chrome

00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,870
Chrome's beginnings which itself is a

00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:54,090
fork of key HTML which was the rendering

00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,620
engine for conqueror so you have the

00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:58,230
same sort of open source project that

00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:01,140
spans like probably like over two

00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:03,840
decades at this point which basically is

00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:07,170
relying on and built upon by everyone

00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:11,250
because it's economically unsound to do

00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:12,960
pretty much anything else last common

00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,810
operational benefit is to actually

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,390
leverage external contributions when

00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:21,330
Facebook launched react react ecosystem

00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:25,500
what they did is they were papers about

00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:27,600
all of the other pieces of software that

00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,310
they thought would be useful they had

00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,410
some reference implementations for some

00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:35,040
of them but really quickly what happened

00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:37,770
is others in the community started

00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,870
building an investing time in sort of

00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,870
these other points of the overall

00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:48,630
solution that the react team had

00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,100
envisioned for front-end development as

00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,810
I mentioned before then they ended up

00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,340
like hiring a bunch of the people that

00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:56,340
had worked on these software - so like

00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:57,450
multiple amounts of benefits and they

00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,370
actually dropped the reference

00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,070
implementations and started relying on

00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:07,590
things like react order of redux for

00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:13,130
their own internal projects - um and on

00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:17,430
to do strategic benefits a very common

00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:19,280
strategy used by lots of companies to

00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:22,350
buy essentially a developer mind share

00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,290
is what I refer to as on ramping

00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:27,750
developers this is what you see a lot of

00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:30,150
happening in the clouds and clouds Wars

00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:32,010
today it's

00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,710
one of the reasons why a company like

00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:37,910
Microsoft purchased github and now in

00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:39,839
p.m. it's basically the idea that

00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:42,059
increasingly than ones making the

00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:44,339
decisions about what kind of software an

00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:47,549
enterprise users are the developers

00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:51,390
themselves essentially because they will

00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:54,809
play an amuse open source or open api's

00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:57,450
on their own time then they will rely on

00:47:54,809 --> 00:48:00,270
those same API is when they start

00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:03,839
prototyping quickly a new product or a

00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:07,470
part of a new an existing product on

00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:10,170
their job um and by the time a prototype

00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:13,440
actually is ready to get turned into a

00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:15,869
product well why would you change the

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,319
technology that you've used um so far

00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:22,529
right and so at that time companies that

00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:25,619
have invested a lot of resources in

00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:28,589
creating open-source tools in building a

00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:30,720
community around that often for free can

00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:32,819
leverage that and turn the enterprise

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,569
that's actually going to use the

00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:39,240
software into customers you see that in

00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:41,789
clouds but you also see that a lot was a

00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:44,730
lot of them more open-source focused

00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:46,349
companies like elastic for example and

00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:50,420
that uses elastic search that creates

00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:57,240
elastic search or you know MongoDB etc

00:48:50,420 --> 00:49:01,140
lastly a very very common strategic play

00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:03,420
that companies will which companies will

00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:07,309
rely on will rely on open source on this

00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:10,470
called commoditizing your complement so

00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:11,970
the way to think about this is if you

00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:15,690
want to increase your market share for

00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:18,599
example and one of the easier strategy

00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:21,869
to do so is to make sure that where your

00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:27,029
market is is actually open source for

00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:29,730
example looking at Google Google its key

00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:31,740
focus is search right in the way that

00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:37,020
they bring eyeballs to search what they

00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:40,260
sell ads is by making sure that the

00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:42,779
complement to search how people come in

00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:43,559
new search is actually open source and

00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:45,630
doesn't belong to

00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:48,299
competitor of theirs right this is why

00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:50,069
they invest so heavily in chromium you

00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:53,880
know in chrome the web browser and

00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:56,569
Android the operating system similarly

00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:00,239
if you look for Intel Intel cells chips

00:49:56,569 --> 00:50:03,479
the complement to chips is obviously an

00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:05,569
operating system right Intel would have

00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:08,699
a much harder time selling their chips

00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:10,709
if it was in was dealing only with

00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:12,509
proper to your ecosystem which is why it

00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:14,640
turns out that they're the biggest Linux

00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,439
contributor and of all of the different

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,160
corporations playing contributing to

00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:23,249
Linux similarly Red Hat the second Linux

00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,299
the second biggest Linux contributor is

00:50:23,249 --> 00:50:32,420
a service company that sells essentially

00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:36,779
services on top of Linux and lots of

00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:41,160
products on top of it again way easier

00:50:36,779 --> 00:50:44,369
for Red Hat to sell that on top of an

00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:46,859
open-source operating system then it

00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:50,009
would be on top of a proprietary one

00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:51,329
when it could basically mean we're

00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:56,849
basically their business could be turned

00:50:51,329 --> 00:51:00,569
off at a whim lastly and that example is

00:50:56,849 --> 00:51:02,400
interesting because it is even further

00:51:00,569 --> 00:51:04,650
away from what people think when they

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,499
think about open source in general if

00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:10,339
you consider that um you know Facebook

00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:13,499
is Facebook's main business is

00:51:10,339 --> 00:51:16,019
essentially minding user data to sell

00:51:13,499 --> 00:51:18,809
advertisement you'll quickly realize

00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:21,839
that the complement to that and that one

00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:24,959
of Facebook's biggest costs is outside

00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:29,039
of of course their engine their human

00:51:24,959 --> 00:51:31,019
talent is their data centers right so a

00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,489
number of years ago Facebook started

00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:39,199
what's called the Open Compute Project

00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:42,390
which is basically open open sourcing

00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:46,829
hardware for data centers and even data

00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:49,589
center designs the outcome of that is

00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:52,079
that it created a level competing field

00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:54,150
a level marketplace where every

00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,790
manufacturer of hardware could be

00:51:54,150 --> 00:52:03,090
building the same would be

00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:05,610
the same kind of server racks and would

00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:08,760
not be competing an IP but basically

00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:12,660
essentially on their ability to build

00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:16,470
and ship those servers which brought

00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:18,570
prices down considerably Facebook do

00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:20,310
least some estimates I think after two

00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:23,490
or three years and they had already

00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:26,400
saved I think two billion dollars so

00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:28,770
billion was a be right on operating

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,220
costs thanks to the Open Compute Project

00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:36,780
and that was in 2017 so the amounts are

00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:38,340
probably you know maybe up to an order

00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:42,090
of magnitude bigger it's just at this

00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:43,980
point so it's a huge really smart play

00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:46,710
around open-source there is two

00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:50,000
strategic one that another player in the

00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:53,280
field AT&T is basically reproducing was

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,860
5g and all of the OpenStack you know 5g

00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,920
it's again a play to basically

00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:03,120
commoditize the hardware and the whole

00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:06,000
market that they will need to rely on to

00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:09,540
be able to ship 5g across the different

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,940
places where AT&T does that and so again

00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:15,330
a really sound strategy for them to cut

00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:17,790
down costs in the process of doing so

00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:19,410
and I sort of rushed to these different

00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:22,110
sites I hope we can have questions

00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:25,230
around the last ones if you want to and

00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:27,870
yeah that's it thank you very much for

00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:31,080
having me I hope this was useful to you

00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:33,510
the slides are already here if you want

00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:37,920
to have a look at them so a bit that Lee

00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:39,980
a why - contribute and I'm happy to take

00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,980
questions

00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:46,000
