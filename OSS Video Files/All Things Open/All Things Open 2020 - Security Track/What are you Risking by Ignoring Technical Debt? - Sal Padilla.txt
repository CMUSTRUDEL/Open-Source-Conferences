	00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,200
all right

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,320
technical debt this is a little story

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:17,920
about technical

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,920
debt uh what are you risking right

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,160
so this is the

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,119
u.s national debt we are now as of last

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,440
night

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,680
at 27 trillion dollars

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,000
uh your share is only

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,760
217 000 so

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,840
if you just want to make a check out to

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,360
the us government and help pay this off

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,120
you only need to pay about two and

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,920
seventeen thousand

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,039
that should be a problem for some of you

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
it is a problem for me

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,800
interestingly our

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,079
that gdp to gdp is a hundred and fifty

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,439
four percent now

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:10,400
so we owe more than the country produces

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,720
fortunately we don't have to pay this

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,759
debt off

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,960
in perspective i would say your

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,240
technical debt your debt is not this

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,600
bad and hopefully it's not this bad if

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,040
it's this bad i would

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,880
have to be very worried um

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,960
so but i thought this was very

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,720
interesting but this is not the

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,159
technical debt we're talking about this

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,200
is not the debt that we're going to

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,439
cover today

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,079
fortunately because we would never solve

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,479
this problem

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,399
so let's talk about what we're talking

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,680
about today this is the agenda

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,040
we'll do an intro background before open

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,880
source

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,439
after open source high level stats

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,920
how did we get into debt but more

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,200
importantly how do we get out of debt

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,200
and what am i risking

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,119
so my name is sal padilla for those

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,239
uh if you didn't hear um i am in

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,440
or used to be an enterprise devops

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
i was the dev sec ops architect for that

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,200
company

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
um is this still devsecops

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,239
what are we calling it now devops

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,840
devsecops i'm calling it devsecops

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,160
ah we want security in the mix

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,519
that was a long debate we had on

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,640
linkedin that was pretty fun

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,480
it was it was it was uh

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,239
it was interesting to see where people's

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,440
thoughts were on on that

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,720
um so i am

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,400
also an engineer and as a

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,720
along with an architect because i'm

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,519
still fairly hands-on

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,920
i am an evangelist so i could talk about

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,440
devops all day

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,959
i have 30 plus years of development and

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,840
devops experience

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,080
i was in software development for 20

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,560
something years and then devops for the

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
last

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,840
10 something years so been doing devops

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,920
for quite some time

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,239
uh previously enterprise devops

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,800
architect for the largest energy company

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:22,800
in the us so that was a pretty big um

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,680
pretty big uh installation and currently

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
i am the i'm a principal consultant for

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
infosys

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,239
so yes you can hire me i am now a gun

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,239
for hire if you want

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,120
but let's talk about technical debt if

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,840
you don't care about

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,640
risk or security

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,560
then this might not be of much interest

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,680
to you

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,680
but but

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,200
if you care about security if you care

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,760
about breaches into your

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,120
network and your applications and your

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,200
data

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,879
if you care about quality and

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,959
performance

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,959
then this may be of interest to you

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,560
so how did we how do we get into debt

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,919
right who remembers what life was like

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,919
before open source

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
so does that computer look familiar to

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,160
anybody

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,680
other than me because that would be bad

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,120
oh that computer probably only had about

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,000
16 megabytes of ram

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,960
not gigabytes megabytes of ram

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,160
programming in

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,880
c or pascal are basic which is not

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,320
around anymore probably

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,800
um but that does bring back some

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,800
memories

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
so zero percent

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,080
what was zero percent can anybody guess

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,080
what zero percent was

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,759
zero percent was

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,120
um brian says it's no

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,160
code right how much

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,160
no code zero yeah actually it was no

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,720
open source code in those days

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,360
uh which wasn't that long ago actually

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
um

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,199
how much it was zero percent was how

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,000
much of your application

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,840
code was open source that's probably not

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,600
even

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,960
15 years ago all of your code was

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,120
written from scratch

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:50,479
right we wrote all the code

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,000
uh later on we started getting some

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,960
libraries from

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,880
folks like microsoft right and that

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,080
helps speed things up a little bit

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:06,639
but for for the most part we wrote

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:11,600
all of the code

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,759
85 percent so can anybody guess what 85

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,759
is

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,840
i can but i don't think it's fair

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
because i think we created that

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
statistic

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,880
80 i don't i can't see the chat actually

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,960
but i don't know

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,639
if anybody's doing a chat yeah they are

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,600
if you mouse over the bottom of your

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,360
screen

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,400
it'll fly up and then you can click the

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,160
chat button there and see what

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,840
everybody's talking about

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:44,800
let's see i'm trying to

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,800
oh i just

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:52,319
i just showed you the answer

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,680
85 um actually mark if you can read the

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
chat

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,319
off that would be actually helpful

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,840
michael says 87.93

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,840
uh of statistics are just made up in the

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
moment

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,770
close close i think michael just made

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,930
that one up

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,930
[Laughter]

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,319
85 is

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,880
how much of your application code is now

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,360
open source

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,520
so in modern software development the

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,319
way we write code the applications these

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,840
days

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,840
you could expect up to 85 percent of

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,880
your

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,479
is open source code

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,599
so we went from zero to eighty five

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,039
percent which

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,599
to me seems like overnight

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,960
and the fifteen percent that's left is

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,800
really just

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,280
business logic right or some glue code

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,720
to

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,080
basically glue all the logic open source

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,120
code together and this is

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,240
this this was a huge paradigm shift this

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,720
is incredible we started delivering

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,720
writing and delivering applications at

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,440
amazing speed because we were no longer

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
writing

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,680
the bulk of the code we just had to glue

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,960
everything together

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,960
so but does anyone

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
remember what their thoughts were about

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:26,160
open

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:28,000
source when it first came out i'm

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,960
watching the chat room here

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,240
just giving people a second it says

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,760
untrusted

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,399
says brian right

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,399
we um

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,680
we we are very uh

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,080
eerie of using open source when it when

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
it first started coming out because it

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
was

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,120
again yes untrusted we weren't sure what

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,880
kind of code

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,880
we were actually had um

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,440
in our company we were we had a idea

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,640
or someone wanted if we wanted to use

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,839
open source

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,320
someone said we had to look at all the

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,040
code

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,880
and we're like that's not possible um

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,200
before we could even use it so we said

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,519
well that that's not going to work

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
yeah we have a bunch of answers here on

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,040
that one too

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,920
is what what did you think about it um

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,920
jonathan says awesome

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,360
yes not secure which lincoln i'm

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,760
surprised there because

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,200
when we first started using open source

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,760
to build projects

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,560
security wasn't thought of in this sense

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,800
it was just

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,959
man this is so much easier i can just

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,760
get grab this framework and be able to

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,440
go

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,040
so i'm surprised that you you were

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,040
thinking security right off the bat

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,680
yes i mean with with with

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,440
open source we're really powerful open

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,000
open source like spring when

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,320
when spring first came out um there was

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,480
a lot a lot a lot of

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,160
hesitancy to use it because it was so

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,360
invasive to your

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,399
your application and to your network it

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,839
it was you let spring do so much

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,240
right um but then again

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,079
but now everyone's using experience so

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,760
everyone just agreed to trust it

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,880
but in in those days um this wasn't just

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,440
a simple widget right of

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240
code that just displays something this

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,519
was

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,640
connecting to your internal systems like

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,680
ldap and security

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,839
systems so that was that was very

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,160
those that took us some time to really

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,839
get comfortable with that

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
but now everyone's using it and everyone

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,360
uses it to basically do the security

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,560
with spring security but so

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,560
we've come a long way

00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:01,680
but and we're developing applications so

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,399
much faster now

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,399
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,079
anyone want to guess what 51 is

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,079
51 any guesses

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,839
i'm not seeing anything come through

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,839
okay

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,320
people up to date people up to date

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,380
that's what brian says people up to date

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,880
on their code

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,880
[Laughter]

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,480
i don't know if anyone's actually up to

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,200
date on all the code and application

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,200
these days

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,040
with development teams developing um

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,040
parts of the application does anyone

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,839
ever actually know what all the code is

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,200
these days and now they've gone into

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,519
tiers you have a ui

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,720
team you have a back-end team you have a

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,600
middleware team

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,839
and so nobody knows exactly what's in

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,000
everybody's code these days and

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,760
it's very i've what i've seen is very

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,600
difficult to get those things to talk

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,639
those layers to get talked together

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,800
if they don't collaborate very well it

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,600
becomes like oh my this is broken

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,600
what why is this broken and every day

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
we're just fixing problems of why is the

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,920
application's not working

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:25,839
but 51 back to this statistic

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:29,040
um how much is open source

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,160
has known vulnerabilities

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,279
so that's about half

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,920
of all the open source libraries being

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,120
used by

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,040
developers well sal can you identify

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,240
that are you talking javascript are you

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,160
talking java

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,600
what are you talking about this is

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,560
probably from

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,600
java from the java world from npm it's

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,920
probably

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,839
from the npm world is probably even

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,200
higher

00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,320
it's so much it's so new and the folks

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,320
writing that those

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,720
are more newer to

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,079
they're probably younger right so in the

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,519
old days security was

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,160
was uh at the forefront of our thought

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,200
process

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,399
and i believe these days that's

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,480
not the case with with

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,760
with newer developers they're just

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,720
wanting to

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,800
put new features new cool features out

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,160
there without really thinking about

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,959
um security so i'm really when you're

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,279
talking about

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,440
things like npm that would probably that

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,120
statistic's probably higher

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,519
that's even which is a little bit scary

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,519
actually

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,040
but we're looking about half your code

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,120
has known vulnerabilities

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,000
half the libraries you're using as known

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,000
vulnerabilities so

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,560
how did i get into debt right

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,199
you quite simply wrote custom code

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,800
that's

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:05,600
once you started writing custom code you

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,639
basically started incurring technical

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,560
debt

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,320
i don't know if you realize that was

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,079
happening i'm sure your business folks

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,600
didn't realize that was happening

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:18,800
but yeah just writing custom code and

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,639
you're you started incurring

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,760
debt and like most

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,240
good it shops would do they

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,440
they started scanning their code using

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,959
scanning tools

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,480
like sonar cube for

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:40,240
quality or a nexus iq or black

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,360
duck for open source libraries

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,000
security scans vulnerability scans and

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,720
maybe

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,920
they're using check marks or vera code

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,639
or fordify

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:56,839
for security vulnerabilities

00:14:52,639 --> 00:15:00,160
of of of their code that they're writing

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:04,079
right and

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,920
what's happening is these these scans

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:11,120
are are finding all these potential

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,800
defects in your application that

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:19,920
if goes unchecked could be disastrous

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,920
right so

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,160
that is the downside of the scanning

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,240
tools while

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,800
you're creating you're you're you're

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,759
working towards better quality of your

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,839
code and your applications

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,839
you're also incurring technical debt

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,480
so how do we get i'm sorry before you

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,519
move on yeah we've got a couple

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,320
questions here

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,440
thomas asks do you think that younger

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,399
developers

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,440
expect more security to be built in from

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,120
the start

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,839
is there an assumption now with the new

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,839
developers

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,160
security let's talk about security for a

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,160
minute there so application security

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,360
uh from uh from from his perspective

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,800
yes it should be security

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,399
is not something you want your every new

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,959
developer any developer

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:22,720
to be um have a hand in actually

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:26,639
that security framework really should be

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:30,320
well established um

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:35,199
in the beginning and it's generally

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:39,279
your a core group of developers or

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:42,639
that that is writing or maintaining

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:45,680
that security framework it's so what

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,560
should be done and we did this at other

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,959
places is

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,560
we we write basically our own security

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,759
libraries

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,040
that we basically hand hand over

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,680
to the developer to develop the dev

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,880
teams

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,160
to use right so from his perspective

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,360
yes it's it's not something

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,000
um developers should be

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,720
having to deal with right it's just

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,480
something that's

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,720
given to them and and for them to use

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,199
call this all that right but how does

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,120
that relate to open source components if

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,079
i go and download an open source

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,799
component

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,640
is my basic assumption now that because

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,600
of all the notoriety that is going to be

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,600
relatively safe

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,600
well that's a good question let me come

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
back to that one

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,000
because i think there's a there's a

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,520
slide where we talk about that

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,039
all right then we've got another

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,160
question here that says

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,200
so many vulnerabilities are undisclosed

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,640
to the masses until their use has

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,080
waned my question is when you say

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,840
known vulnerability known by who

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,840
the public the researchers who knows the

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
vulnerability

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,320
so for example um

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,600
i've implemented nexus iq

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,919
so and i'm very familiar with nexus iq

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,600
uh i'm not as familiar with how black

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,320
duck

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,880
does it but there's a there's this

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,880
there's a

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:26,880
um there's a

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,000
no there's a there's a group that

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,679
publishes uh vulnerabilities around open

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,280
source i can't remember the exact name

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,320
of it

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,679
but sauna type the the

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,799
the vendor for nexus iq um

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,039
also has their own folks right

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,039
so

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,840
so there's a central group that is

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,679
looking at it

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,600
that the open source vulnerabilities but

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,200
then you also have the sonotype folks

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,960
with their own folks going through

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,440
those with whatever is published and

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,200
also finding their own

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,559
and i'm sure they publish back to the

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,240
central

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:11,039
um central um central uh

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,559
group but there is a central group and i

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,880
don't remember mark do you remember

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,480
what that central group is called are

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,840
you talking about the cvs

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,919
everything yeah yeah um

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,080
i can go and look it up i don't always

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,600
remember the acronym i don't even

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,760
remember the name anymore right i'm

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,280
i'm pretty sure black duck subscribes to

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,360
that um

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,039
same group but basically there is a

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,960
group that is looking at the open source

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,960
vulnerabilities

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,880
but the um

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,200
i know have another client that's also

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:50,840
using nexus iq and

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,080
but they sona type also has their own

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,799
folks

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,080
does that answer your question yeah i

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,559
think so i'm just

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,360
reading from the chat room that was good

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,360
cve

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,880
common vulnerability and exposures

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,240
there's a group that actually manages

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,240
that whole process

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,360
i think that's what you're talking about

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,960
um are we

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,520
slowing down your presentation or do you

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,799
want more questions i got more coming

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,440
um no we're good all right paul says

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,679
what questions should developers be

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,600
asking if they don't hear from their

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,880
teams about security components

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,960
so if there is not anything

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,080
built in if there's not an automated

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,520
process

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,559
for looking at components uh what should

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,640
what should developers be asking

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,720
let me table that one too because

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
there's another slide that talks about

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,000
that

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:47,760
that's fair enough let's move on okay

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,280
so how do we get out of debt right

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,320
we don't we don't give the government

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,600
217 000 that's for sure

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,400
but like any

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,039
debt you you should be making regular

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,360
payments

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,960
right um so

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,120
you don't want to you don't need to

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,600
spend a big lump sum

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,360
you don't need this paid off 27 trillion

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,000
dollars right you just paid off

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,080
gradually

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,440
it's just like buying it's like paying

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,760
off your new tesla

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,760
right you're you make monthly payments

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,679
you can drive the folks around and

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,320
impress everyone in your tesla but at

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,240
the

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,600
fourth week you need to make a payment

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,559
it can't always be about features

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,600
microsoft has said this long ago

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,600
actually microsoft

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:48,559
prioritizes security over features

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,679
but you need to do some housekeeping so

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:55,520
maybe every fourth or fifth sprint

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:58,640
you dedicate to technical debt but

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,880
for the ones that are high priority you

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,039
need to work those into your sprint but

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,440
maybe every fourth or fifth sprint you

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,000
just

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,799
dedicate to technical debt yeah you're

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,559
not going to see

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,280
new flashy flashy features

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,600
that's going gonna be that you can show

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,960
off

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,200
but it needs to be done

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
right

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:29,280
so what can you do what else can you do

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,760
don't spend right sona type for example

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,280
has an

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,039
ide plugin for eclipse intellij videos

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,159
visual studio

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,039
for nexus iq where you can

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,000
find your vulnerabilities open source

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,720
vulnerabilities

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,679
as code is being developed right i'm

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,120
sure the other

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:52,000
tools have this similar similar thing

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,000
sonar cube

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,760
has a ide plug-in called sonarlint so

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,200
you could do

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,600
that you can get quality

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,559
um scanning while you're developing your

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,440
code writing your code

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,000
you could do oss scanning while you're

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,000
writing the

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,559
code make sure that anything you're

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
using is safe to use

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:19,360
so you save on technical debt

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,159
by not creating more right

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,000
you create a culture where writing good

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,919
code

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,120
is expected and rewarded

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,840
so this is not a fun thing right so we

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,840
tried we

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,640
at my last company we thought how can we

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,400
gainify right how can we

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:44,240
gamify um this behavior

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,480
where we where developers write

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,559
want to write good code right they're in

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,559
they're

00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:54,080
incentivized to write good code

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:56,960
so maybe you you create a game where

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,080
the team that has the least or is

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,600
trending

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,640
the best around technical debt whether

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,159
their technical gut is going down

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,679
um they win something right

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,520
win a lunch whatever um

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,440
which when we get back to the office

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,720
could be good or

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,960
everyone gets to go take out um

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,840
but that could be something you can do

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,480
so maybe

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,200
you gamify it but you create this

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,240
culture

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,039
where you aren't

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,480
like the old cliche shift left right

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,760
you're shifting the

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,200
quality and security left where the code

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,520
is being

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,520
written

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:51,200
um invest wisely so

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,799
this is kinda along that question um

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,279
what if you're not hearing anything

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,120
right i think

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,880
so this is very important uh

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,440
you you need to create a governance

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,120
model around open source

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,559
um consumption or live usage within your

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,679
company

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,960
so you're going to need your sourcing

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,440
and compliance group for the folks

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,320
because you need to make sure the the

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,600
open source

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,480
licenses that are associated with those

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,120
components can be used within your

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,159
company you're not

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,480
exposing company to any legal issues

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,840
with

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,960
licensing your cyber security group of

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,480
course needs to be

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,600
in there because they need to see

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:46,159
um they need to basically vet

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,600
and um approve any open source

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,919
components being used by your

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,120
application within your company

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,919
if it's within a certain threshold right

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,640
you they probably won't allow criticals

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,360
and

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,679
highs but they may apply they may allow

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,480
mediums right

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,240
um and then you also need your

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,799
enterprise software development

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,080
governance group most folk most

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,600
companies have that

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,440
were you have your

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,080
mostly architects and lead tech leads

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,360
but they all need to come together and

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,279
agree

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,480
and create a plan on developing

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,760
standards and processes around

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,760
open source usage

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,000
when you get all those groups together

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,279
you get their buy-in

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,760
you create devsecops champions to help

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,520
socialize this

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,960
but what what should be happening

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,840
is the the the if you

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,480
if you're if you're doing your

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,799
development

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,919
if you're doing your development and

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,640
you're doing your scan during

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,440
development

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,400
and then you're also doing your scanning

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,600
around

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,640
in your pipeline and you're scanning on

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,120
every build or

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,279
every other build or month or week

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,799
however you want to do it

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:15,840
um there needs to be

00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:20,159
those those results of those scans

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,279
are are available or pushed

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:26,559
to your dev teams as far as what it what

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,640
what the scans are finding right so

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,320
you find it while you're developing you

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,840
find it during the scan

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,960
and your dev teams and your product

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,279
owners it's up to

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,159
them to to prioritize

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,559
those those defects and make sure

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,600
they're taken care of

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,000
so one of the things you want to discuss

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,640
with your

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,840
oss governance strat governance is

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,360
around strategy

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,399
there's there's several strategies you

00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:00,000
could take around open source

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:03,760
you could block everything which

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,799
some folks do that you can block nothing

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,279
and find it later on

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,200
um before it's deployed to production

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,960
during the um

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,480
during the development phase and testing

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,000
phase right

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,799
or you can block some things um

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,440
another shameless plug for um sonotype

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,600
is they have

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,039
nexus iq firewall which is actually

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,640
pretty nice

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:32,480
so you can block some things with with

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,880
um certain rules like for example

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,520
you will block things where the license

00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:42,320
classification could be licensed banned

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,960
so anything with licensed banned won't

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,200
even

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,840
come into your company's ecosystem

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,640
your dev teams won't be able to use

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,320
those

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,360
those components um

00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,240
so that's another way you could handle

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,520
it i've and it really depends on the

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,320
size of your company

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,799
and the number of developers how far you

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,320
are

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,919
how how much of uh how much

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,120
you have already have within your

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,320
ecosystem or if you're starting out

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,640
um new which

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,360
probably not you could block everything

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,640
and do it that way and do a white list

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,840
right you could do a white list we've

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,480
done that i've done that before it's

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,159
doable

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,279
um but at scale it might not be so you

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,399
really need to think

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,399
through that so does that answer

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,039
the other question about if you're not

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,039
hearing anything

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,520
i'm not seeing anything following up so

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,760
i think you did good

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,080
okay any questions around governance

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,799
one of the things that people might and

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,720
you might do

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,120
touch on this to sell to make sure

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,279
people understand that governance

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,279
too can be part of an automation process

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,919
oh your yeah your automation process

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,720
will definitely feed

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:12,080
in into that governance model uh because

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,039
because your automation is doing

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,000
is finding all that right it is finding

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,600
all the

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,720
libraries and code

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,360
that could potentially expose your

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,559
company

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,080
right so the

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:34,640
process your automation is going to be

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,640
part of your process your governance

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
process

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,960
and whether you want to create tickets

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,480
from those scans

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,200
um tracking them is also uh

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,600
an it it depends on what your company

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,880
has

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,520
for ticketing and tracking

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,960
if you're doing jira you have a ticket

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,120
system

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,159
like gs now you could do it that way so

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,480
it's really

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,770
up to you to define the governance

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
people process and tools right

00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:11,039
[Music]

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,440
but it you should you definitely have to

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,440
do that

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:21,360
so the

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,440
net other thing about investing wisely

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,039
um is you want to create a core working

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,960
team

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,320
on cleaning up and maintaining rules and

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,679
policies that these

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,679
scanning tools are using

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:45,279
these these rules and policies

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:48,080
can create unnecessary technical debt

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,080
so you want to go through each rule and

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,440
policy

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,559
and you may want to change their rating

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,279
perhaps you may not think they're high

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,440
or critical maybe you want to downgrade

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,480
it maybe you want to upgrade it

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,760
maybe the threshold is too low so if it

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,880
uh so i mean for example if

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,919
if we've tweaked numbers on sonar cube

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,039
but if it's this

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,840
many not that's not too bad let's change

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,399
it to

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,360
double that and if he gets double that

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,320
then we flag it

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,960
so you'll need to put together a team of

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,320
experienced

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,720
developers and cyber security folks

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,519
and sourcing compliance folks maybe to

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,559
go through

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,240
the rules and those policies

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,919
now i'm not going to sugarcoat it for

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,960
you this

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:44,399
is time consuming and tedious

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:48,720
trust me it's it's gonna require several

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:52,480
meetings hours long but

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,799
it's once you you do it once

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,120
uh that's the good part it's it's a

00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,159
one-time pain

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,640
and once it's done after it's done then

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,679
it's just

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,200
maintenance so that's much easier to

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,519
then it's just maintenance mode so it's

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,159
that's much easier to do then

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,120
so really you nee you need to suck it up

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,960
and do it

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,039
because those rules i'm i promise you

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,720
they need to be tweaked

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,480
they're very strict and they could

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,080
create a lot of noise

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,279
that you may not think is

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,279
is um

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,880
really pertinent to your company or your

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,320
team

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,880
and what this also does it doesn't

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,360
create

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:43,679
a behavior for your dev teams to ignore

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,039
right so if you if you

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,519
that is the worst thing that could

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:51,039
happen is they get conditioned

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,360
to ignore the scans because it they

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,799
basically see it as a bunch of what

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,880
noise

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,840
so that's why you really need to clean

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,960
those

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,960
those rules and policies up

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,320
so that they don't get conditioned to

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,799
ignore it that

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,440
whatever is flag does need to be

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,440
addressed

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,440
does need to be looked at right

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,119
any questions there

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,159
nope looks like you're doing good we got

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,760
about 10 minutes left

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,599
that should be perfect so how do i get

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,879
my company to invest

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,839
in paying for technical debt that is the

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,159
big question

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,159
right

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,639
and the answer is

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,159
it's not about the money you can make

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:48,720
it's about the money you won't lose

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:52,079
right and it's not

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,480
and and

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,760
once they understand that once you're

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,839
it's very hard for

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,359
your product owners to to get this i've

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,640
been there

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,920
it's like i want new cool things

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,839
i want to do this i want to quick fast

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,200
the market i want to attract more

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,240
customers

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,240
um but

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,320
the bottom line is it's about the money

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,520
you won't

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,400
lose and it's not even just about money

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,680
right there's legal exposures that they

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,800
don't see

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,480
there's reputational exposure that they

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,800
don't see

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,920
there's brand exposure that they don't

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,960
see

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,119
uh there's devsecop's new favorite

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,359
example

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:46,640
think equifax right your company will be

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,440
the our new equifax when we do um

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,160
well you you don't want to be them right

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,079
you don't want to be equifax's

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,280
you don't want to be the new equifax you

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,720
don't be the new

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,040
the new company in all our in all our uh

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,079
conferences that we're using as an

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,880
example

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,680
right and these are things that they

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,079
don't see

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,960
or feel right they can't put their hands

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,599
on it but this

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:17,440
is what you need to basically

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,800
explain to your product owners to your

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,839
business that this

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:26,560
is what you're risking

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:29,040
by ignoring technical debt

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,079
you know so you make a really really

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,560
good point i mean

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,560
daniel kahneman actually wrote a paper

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,599
that won the nobel prize on this kind of

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,040
thing

00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,040
that what you're looking at here is

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,440
you're talking to the business now

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,760
you're not talking to the developers

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,480
and so you're talking at a business

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,640
level

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,200
to get them to realize what the exposure

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,359
is this is a great slide

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,560
and it's because the business is the one

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,640
that's paying the bill

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,599
right it's probably true in most

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,119
companies

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,800
right they're the ones paying for it it

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:08,960
really should be a zero-sum

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:12,880
shop right they don't make money

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:16,320
they basically a service

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,040
company internally to

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,839
um whatever company you hear right you

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,839
you pay for an i.t

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,839
service

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:34,320
any questions there and always also

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,320
a lannister always pays a stagnant debt

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:43,680
and that is brings us to

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,240
open discussion um

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,119
are there any questions you know what

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,240
let's actually

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,160
open this discussion up and

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,000
i will give people microphone if they

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,520
request it and that way we can actually

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,599
talk back and forth yeah let me know

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,800
if you've got a question here and we can

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,040
do it

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,000
elisa's already here which is nice to

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,440
see she's ready

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,119
to go and she's answering questions in

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,599
the chat already for you

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,359
oh fantastic well that's going great

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,400
thank you

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,720
i always i always like help uh

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,160
so when you look at the presentation

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,640
that you're giving here

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,640
if somebody could take away one thing

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,480
from your presentation and actually

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,359
start implementing it tomorrow what

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,359
would you have them do

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,400
as far as technical debt

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,359
yeah i mean it's it's

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,359
how do you start

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,599
it's so i've i've i've actually

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,280
met some folks i've talked to some folks

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,599
about what i was going to talk about

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,440
um at this conference

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,359
and they were like i've never even heard

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,079
of that which

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,240
kind of hard to believe but there are

00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,880
some new developers out there that me

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,960
and nadi

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,280
may not be familiar with the concept of

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,720
technical debt

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,599
but and there might there's probably a

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,640
lot of business folks and i know that

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,200
it's not even a year ago

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,119
that i left i had to explain technical

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,400
debt to the business folks

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,599
at my former company

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,079
and get it did they get it and that is

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,079
probably

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,800
exactly yeah um that

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,760
and that brings me back to this slide

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,839
right

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:39,839
it's get them to understand

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:43,599
first what is technical debt yeah

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:46,400
right um

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,440
once you get them to understand that

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,920
what

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,680
is technical debt and it's not something

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,760
you can put your hand on

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,079
your hands on it's not something you can

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,240
drive around in and show everybody it's

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,359
not something you can present

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,200
it's about the money you won't lose

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,200
okay i'm going to jump in because we got

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,319
a really relevant question from lincoln

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,760
on that and lincoln it's

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:12,160
perfect segway here is there a way to

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,520
quantify the cost

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,079
of technical debt that is a great

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,760
question

00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,960
i how do you quantify something

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,960
that you didn't lose

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,240
right how did potentially you could lose

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,440
yeah right

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:32,720
i that is

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,760
that i i totally i i've thought about

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,079
that i've had that

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,480
same question i'm like people have asked

00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,839
that before like how do you quantify it

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,040
right

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,800
i don't know i don't know you don't know

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,200
what you didn't lose

00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,359
right what how do you quantify legal

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,800
exposure i guess you could quantify that

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,839
reputation brand right let's back up

00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,920
legal exposure is pretty easy if you

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,400
used an open source component

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,800
that says if you use me you have to give

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,000
your software away for free

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,680
right you absolutely

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,800
measure on that right um

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,520
the reputation and the brand exposure

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,680
you know those are tough because there

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,200
isn't any quantifier on that

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,240
right exactly there's we do know

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,760
that equifax we have real hard numbers

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,839
from equifax and that's why they're the

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,960
poster child

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:32,000
yeah you don't want to be a new poster

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,319
child

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,319
yeah i mean equifax is now a verb

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,800
and i like those guys i know them so i i

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,000
can say that in chess but

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,079
um you know now it's a lincoln you have

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,599
a really really good question

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,560
that's a business model waiting to

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,280
happen if you can figure that one out

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,079
you could if you figure that out please

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,440
uh

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,319
put a talk go please speak at

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,640
the next conference because i that'd be

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,160
that

00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,240
there'd be a lot of people that would be

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,319
interested in how you quantify that

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,760
it's like how do you quantify something

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,480
you didn't lose

00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,079
or don't you've got matt here and bob

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,520
who have a discussion going on which i

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,960
think is pretty cool

00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:21,200
but one of the things that you can do is

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,560
look at the probability of something

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,920
happening and that's what the bean

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,000
counters do right

00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,040
the legal team it used to be the legal

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,400
team would look at it

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,280
and say if that exposure happens

00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,240
we're exposed to this much risk it's

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,800
going to cost us

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,400
this much to fix it before it it's worth

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,640
taking the risk

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,560
right so the legal team could actually

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,760
look at it in that sense

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,440
but now things are getting so much more

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,040
complex

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,040
i don't know if that's viable anymore

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,040
yeah that i don't know if anyone's got

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,280
this answer about quantifying

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,440
technical debt all right lincoln i think

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,920
you just won the technical debt t-shirt

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,920
of the day

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,319
all right so always good to talk to you

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,880
um

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,000
got a great uh thing going in the chat

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,520
i'm actually going to save the

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,520
chat for myself because there's a lot of

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,960
good stuff in there if you'd like to get

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,800
ahold of chat

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,800
get all the chat you want to get hold of

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,580
sal you can

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,000
get the answer

00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:27,920
[Laughter]

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,240
you also have just a pile of jokes once

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:34,240
that came out

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:40,480
about cell and breaking bad that

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:45,119
you must have just been hammered

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,119
no i actually did all right thank

00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,800
