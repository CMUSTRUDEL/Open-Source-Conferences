	Presented by: Eric Hart, Optum
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Security Track

Abstract: A common challenge in organizations is how to keep the topic of security at the forefront but not blow CAPEX or OPEX budgets. Compounded with the industry-wide shortage of cybersecurity talent in the workforce, there is little left to wonder why the increased burden of security keeps moving faster than most can keep up. In this talk I will highlight 5 Pillars for implementing a self-sustaining security education model within any organization that will:

- Convince the C-Suite the investment in talent is worth the effort
- Make the CISO your trusted ally
- Build a sustainable and repeatable framework that is product agnostic
- Recharge and motivate developers to do more and reward them for the effort.

this opportunity to uh to be able to

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,239
share this uh talk with you

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,840
um i'll tell you a little bit about the

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,320
background of talking just uh

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,720
in just a second i titled up the five

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,960
pillars of security success

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,360
uh but just a little bit about me as i

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,479
said i am a senior principal engineer

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
for optum i am an old school guy if you

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,520
can't tell by uh

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,280
all of this yeah i've been around for a

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,680
while uh if you

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,960
blend the time that i've been in it and

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,080
cyber security

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,960
uh it's hitting the third decade now and

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,400
so yeah

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,759
i've started out uh basically doing uh

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,520
network i worked for ge for a few years

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
and moved my way over into software

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,560
later on

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,720
did a lot of different type of

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
programming and some very oral archaic

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,640
languages hopefully you don't have any

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,439
of them

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,640
in your infrastructure anymore moved

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,720
along

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,840
through many parts of the stack as it

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,159
were

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,720
got into cyber security going through

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,640
college found a big interest for it

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
actually was told by a friend or

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,600
colleague said hey you know you might

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,840
want to think about that as a career

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,920
that's a good thing i thought you know

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,439
maybe i will it's kind of a fun thing

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,479
i'm sort of a

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,160
hacking aficionado i enjoy hackathons

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,399
i take part of several different

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,840
programs uh we have an internal program

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,360
an option called the technology

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,760
leadership career path

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,840
i am a member of that uh i have an

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,319
internal podcast where i work

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,480
uh i am certified through sans to giac

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,480
so i've gone through that i'm also

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,959
the chapter president for a local

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,160
chapter of the cloud security alliance

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,920
so i do try to live what uh what i learn

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,760
and share those out to the community at

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,120
large i do believe that

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,720
education is a lifelong endeavor and

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
as you can see there in the bottom right

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,120
when i'm not uh busy doing security then

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,800
my passion obviously is guitar

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,040
i love the blues remember the times

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
back when uh guys like gary moore and

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,680
eric clapton

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,080
are all the rage there's some of my

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
major influences

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,440
and so really with this talk what i

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,640
wanted to talk about

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,519
in terms of security success uh i want

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,280
to kind of point out

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,879
that when we think of pillars of

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,920
security these are not the ones that

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,599
you're traditionally

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,360
familiar with and obviously i'm not

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
going to try and use jedi mind control

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
on you i don't have that skill

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,560
when we think about the differences

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,319
between security and security success

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,040
the pillars of security all around

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,120
compliance and

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,959
i promise you that for those of you who

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,640
listened to alice's talk earlier

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,760
we had no prior communication onto this

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,360
so you're probably going to see some

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,159
common themes here

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,840
that is simply coincidence um and i

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,920
think it's a happy coincidence

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,480
uh because it means obviously we're

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,879
speaking to the same things

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,799
when we talk about uh you know the

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,720
pillars within security success

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,080
we're really talking about security

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,400
within devops or

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
devsecops or sec devops however you

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,760
choose

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,400
uh the biggest threats really to the

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,480
organization

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,159
this comes is how i explained this

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,560
program and i'll tell you just a moment

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,879
why i got into this but it's really

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,799
communicating to your organization

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,720
the lack of understanding what those

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,879
risks are

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,599
how do we talk about uh embracing

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,799
learning as part of what we do every day

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,000
and enabling these security skills this

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
applies to mitigating

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,120
all the growing tax services that we

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,880
have now and especially

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,320
as we all are in the cloud and so

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,160
this talk really comes from my

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,120
experience in implementing a program

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,840
internally and i really felt a strong

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,240
need to

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,360
to really convince the the c-suite you

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
know the ceo

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,400
and all the c-suite folks that the

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,560
return on investment

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,520
doesn't really come in hard dollars it

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,360
comes

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,800
more in value that you get through

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,360
increased productivity

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,360
and the knowledge of security now that

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,520
sounds all great and good

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,960
but when we think about how do we become

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,759
skilled in security

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,040
it's a step-by-step process nobody comes

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,919
into this business knowing

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,759
everything about it and it changes

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,600
incrementally over time and it changes

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,520
in different varying speeds if i think

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
back to when i first started

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
you know back in the days of guys like

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
cliff stoll you know

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,080
when he was battling this hacker group

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,320
from overseas

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,520
through the phone lines i was just first

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,800
coming into this going

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,919
what do a phone line it's

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,680
changed so much faster now and the the

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,199
question that we really

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,039
fail to understand sometimes especially

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,120
from a management perspective is

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,880
the expectation that anybody can

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,000
instantly become an expert in security

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,520
it's just not reality and often the

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,680
pushback you get is well

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,160
if that's such a problem why do we want

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,080
to invest in these individuals

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,520
and the answer to that really is because

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,680
the return comes

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,520
greater it's it's that story that you

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,360
hear often between the cio

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,960
and the ceos talking you've heard this

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,520
before the cio

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,800
says what happens if we train all of our

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,800
people and then they leave

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,319
and the ceo says well what happens if we

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,639
don't and they stay

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,720
right it's the chicken versus the egg

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,240
kind of thing so the challenge that

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
you want to be able to take to your

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,680
senior management is

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,199
addressing the fact that the investment

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,440
pays off before

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,560
asking for funding and i'll go into that

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,919
a little bit detail

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
in just a little bit but it kind of

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,800
leaves you asking that question okay

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,240
how do we do some of these things

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
because oftentimes

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
there's a big gap in many organizations

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,840
between

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,520
people who are in the devsecop roles in

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,039
operations and business roles and the

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,199
c-suite

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,520
how do you communicate with them how do

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,199
you get them to understand

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,960
that a risk-based approach is really

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,479
part of the key to this answer and these

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,240
are the questions that i asked and that

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,400
were asked of me

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
being able to communicate to them and

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,080
tell them that the lack of sensitivity

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
for security

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,280
to the risks that are within the

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,440
organization the products we deliver

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,000
is a key problem also

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,759
not having enough skilled security

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
resources across the organization this

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,880
is not new information you can look at

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
all the statistics there's a great

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,639
shortage

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,520
within cyber security for all skill sets

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,639
for both men and women within dev and

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,840
ops and security as a blending of this

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,639
this is a lack that has to be addressed

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,000
there's also the challenge of enabling

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,599
and enticing

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,319
the organization to grow the security

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,880
skills whether they're technical or not

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,800
everybody benefits by having an

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
awareness and a part and a say within

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,880
security

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,520
within your organization being able to

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,400
understand

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,000
that it's a relationship that is between

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,479
everybody who's in security

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,520
and everybody who considered it isn't

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,520
right and that's

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,960
tends to be the dichotomy right we have

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,000
those who are the security experts and

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,840
those who are not

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
this is a problem because we need to

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,400
have this blended and it's a

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,360
strained relationship even our technical

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,360
partners

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,800
they have challenges just trying to

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
complicate they're just trying to

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,919
accomplish

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,919
their security tasks for each product or

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,080
product line that they have

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,680
so how can we address this and this is

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,919
the question that i had well the first

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,000
step

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,960
was finding a trusted ally and that

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,520
happens it comes to

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,039
ciso now you want to wonder why would i

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,639
want to do this well if you think about

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,720
it in business terms

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,520
the ciso's job is to protect the

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,360
business and it's the ciso's job

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,680
to work with the cio and the rest of the

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,639
c-suite to make sure that the business

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,120
needs

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,120
aren't compromised in terms of security

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,560
as if you want to have that level of

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,200
trust

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,800
working with your sisso is a key aspect

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,919
and this is something that i realized

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,000
early on

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,200
if i could find a connection if i could

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,680
find someone who could

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,720
make that introduction from me and

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,440
explain my case to him

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,160
and he was it's him and then listen to

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,760
his needs

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,760
and that's the important thing because

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,360
this can't just be about what you try to

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,440
put in your organization

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,480
listening to what this person who has

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,760
far more experience

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,320
than i did was very key in

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,800
my understanding what keeps him up at

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
night

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,480
right and so forming that allied

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,880
partnership

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,959
really only can come from a culture

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,440
where this individual is accessible

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,920
because there's the bridge there's the

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,320
way to be able to get support

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,279
and endorsement to get this program

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,279
there

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,640
now before i go into more of the details

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,680
i want to kind of i want to talk about

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,880
these these five

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,240
colors that i that i've constructed and

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,760
i want to show you a road map that i use

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,120
to build this within an organization and

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,240
you can follow this for your own

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,800
organization

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,640
this is meant to be more agnostic to a

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,680
product and more about a process

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,399
and even more succinctly about

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,880
the culture and so as you keep in mind

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,560
this is just an example of this system

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,240
and there's some products that i will

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,600
mention sure

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,000
keep in mind you know your mileage can

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,519
vary but you can follow these and then

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,120
if you have questions i'm more than

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,560
happy to engage with you and give you

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,880
some more details on this

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,720
so when we talk about these five pillars

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,839
of security success

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,680
the first one is mindset

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,440
and we all know people who talk about

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,720
this alyssa talked about it too it's

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,360
that mindset

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,399
that comes from experience and it also

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,000
comes from

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,640
accepting others opinions and expertise

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,800
into this thing that gets turned into

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,000
the culture

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,399
with a culture that focuses on security

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,760
as part of the daily business

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,320
then the topics are so strained

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,880
taking these two then the next part

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,560
comes

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,480
is training being able to have

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,399
an inclusive culture where training is

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,600
part of daily processes

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,640
and part of an ongoing process

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
helps support that it keeps you flexible

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,640
as an organization

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,200
it also keeps you current on things the

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,320
next

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,279
comes ownership and lastly

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,000
with ownership also comes the ability to

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,000
lead

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
from that but it doesn't just stop at

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,519
that because

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
while you can put every bit of effort

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,560
into driving towards these

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,959
four areas if you don't take the time

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,480
to recognize individuals for their

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,480
accomplishments

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,839
and i'll go a little bit detail into

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,120
more detail just a bit

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,399
about how you can actually enable them

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,200
then everything else will fall short

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,079
very quickly

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,279
because people for a short time will be

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,959
satisfied in the work

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,279
but when you don't recognize them and

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,200
reward them for these efforts

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:40,399
they don't stay so when we talk about

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
security mindset i love this from bruce

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,000
schneier

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,399
you've all know who he is i've got the

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,040
book

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,440
you've probably got several of his books

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,399
it's thinking about how things can fail

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
but keep in mind for a second this

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,120
doesn't

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
mean that you have to be a pessimist

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
right this is not the

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
negative mindset this is meant to be

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,880
objective in how you look

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,600
at how a given system can fail and

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,920
implant contingencies around this

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,839
this isn't new many organizations do

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,440
this the military is a good example of

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,079
contingency planning

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,440
what they do does not take away from

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,600
primary mission

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,000
but instead it puts the focus on when

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,639
something goes wrong

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,560
what's the response how do you handle it

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,839
so the mission itself does not become

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,600
compromised

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,519
and it seems like an anti-pattern but

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,720
let's not forget

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,160
when we talk about implementing security

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,399
this is different than we talk about

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,519
let's say privacy and schneier goes into

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,320
this as well and that's

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,200
something for another time talk but the

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,160
culture

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600
is key in this and if you have a culture

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,720
where you don't

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,639
reward failure and i love this

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,480
madam sandwich this guy just just

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,279
tickles me completely

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
failure is always an option right even

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,600
when things go wrong

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,639
if you consider what adam always

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,680
insists on it's still a result

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,279
right but we ignore this as a culture

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,320
why if you think about best practices

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,320
within the cloud

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,040
every guide that's written on it and yes

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,160
i'm preaching from the cloud security

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,279
alliance

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,320
but it makes the point it starts

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,519
with failure in mind it's not a negative

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,519
mindset

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,120
it's thinking of the parts the processes

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,040
that are normally forgotten

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,839
and you put guardrails around that to

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,320
mitigate what they call the blast radius

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,240
organizations have done this forever and

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,199
if you're not convinced

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,720
take a look at the space program failure

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,480
is always a part of that planning

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,800
process

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,880
elon musk knows this spacex

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,240
knows this and they plan for this that's

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,000
how crude dragon got

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,519
the international space station and back

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,519
safely

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,920
thinking about the things that can go

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,440
wrong planning for those contingencies

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,760
as part of your culture

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,959
is key now i know what you're thinking

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,680
wow that's kind of a nice speech how do

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,560
we get there

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,000
how do we start down this path where we

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,120
can get security

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,760
in as part of the culture well

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,160
if you want to beat this guy training

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,639
obviously is where it starts

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,839
and a very common analogy within martial

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
arts is

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,040
it takes ten thousand hours to learn a

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,199
specific skill

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,560
and a hundred thousand hours to master

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,600
it

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,000
yes that's very extreme and my sensei

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,279
has pounded that into my head many times

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,839
but it makes the point

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,320
because it's practice and dedication

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,480
building core competency right

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,160
you can't defend what you don't practice

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,839
and you can't be aware

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,320
you're not learning if the learning

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,519
doesn't come from a part of your culture

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,399
right so a learning culture is key

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,720
and it's it's got to be part of what you

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,480
do

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,519
daily so if we think about

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,000
what is security culture

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,639
this quote this quote kind of tickles me

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
away because

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,399
it's what happens when people are left

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,560
with their own devices well

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,320
it's really not that it's kind of funny

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,760
to think of this in the worst possible

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,160
case scenarios because

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,240
people when they're left to their own

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,800
devices in group think

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,279
what usually happens right mob mentality

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,600
takes

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,279
over it's interesting to think about

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,639
that but if we really think what

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,959
culture is in and of itself culture

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,800
is just a set of common understandings

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,880
where

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,800
these understandings are shared in a

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,759
language that has a shared pattern of

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,480
meanings

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,120
and a shared value of beliefs and

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,079
they're integral within the organization

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
if you think about what kotter and

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,240
hesket

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,240
define culture as they call it a

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,800
predictor of business outcomes

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,160
it means revenues and growth right so in

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,759
this vein of thought

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,240
security culture has four commonalities

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,360
it's shared by common values of an

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,320
organization

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,720
what is most important to us as a whole

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,759
shared thinking right this is not

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,759
individual thing

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
this is group think and this is not

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,079
waiting until the gates happen

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,720
as alissa pointed out this is putting it

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,480
into every part of the process right

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,240
i like i like the point said why are you

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,440
waiting till a gate comes along before

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,199
you do threat modeling

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,360
you can throughout model user story in

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,160
your backlog absolutely that's shared

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,720
thinking that's

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,399
shared input you can follow showstax

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,480
model down to that level

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,680
and apply that you don't have to wait

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,240
until you flow the whole thing

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,279
out it's a great way to adapt to that

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,839
right

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,480
being able to use the same vocabulary

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,480
the same

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,680
awareness patterns and the same best

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,639
practices and

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,160
communicate them clearly and this is a

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,399
shared approach this gets

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,160
everybody involved this is not just a

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,880
developer side of this thing this is the

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,959
op side

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,040
too because if you think about it from a

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,240
full stack perspective

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,679
what we as developers hand off to the

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,079
ops folks if we don't have an

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,520
understanding of that in a partnership

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,679
then we're kicking it across the wall

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,000
and that's not devops that's not being

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,360
fully inclusive in that and putting

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,520
security into that

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,280
helps drive that right it's not just a

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,039
death problem

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,600
most importantly the security culture is

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,480
shared by everyone

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,320
everybody has an approach to this

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,480
everybody has something to contribute

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,320
and everyone should have a seat at the

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,559
table it's a problem

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,600
for all sides of the house not just dev

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,840
it's dev

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,240
security and the operational parts that

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,240
as well

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,679
so how can we develop this culture where

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,880
it's

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,240
shared by everyone where we develop

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
these common values

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,039
these common thinking and approaches and

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,280
enhance the organization's footprint

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,640
so the structure that i i thought about

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,960
this when i built this here

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,559
and it's something that's repeatable but

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,720
it can be if can fall into these

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,720
patterns

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,320
before you do however i really recommend

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,840
that you go back to what i talked about

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,640
and you make your allies

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,600
you want to have the ciso the cio the

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,760
c-suite

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,360
partnering with talk through this as an

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,200
approach with them

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,120
get an understanding of what their pain

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,440
points are and then work on a delivery

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,120
plan because when you build consensus

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,640
and then you say here's a structure we

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,400
can follow

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,000
then your chances of success will be

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,960
greater

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,640
so when you try to put together a

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,440
framework like this there's five key

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,760
areas

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,960
that you start with okay and that's

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,840
learning right

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,799
learning in terms of staying current

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,280
upon

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,400
key security areas right what is cloud

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,559
security

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,679
you just saw a great talk by sean

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,120
talking about

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,880
how to take a cookie mindset

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,039
and apply that across some of your

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,880
applications that's a great teaching

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,520
opportunity right

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,600
applying it being able to take those

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,720
lessons take those examples and now put

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,880
it into your code

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,039
and then obviously the lifting part this

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
is okay let's get this into our repost

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,520
let's get this into github and

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,480
artifactory and all these other places

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,160
we keep this

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,480
and let's get this down to where we can

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,480
actually show something

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,760
this creates an opportunity because the

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,760
opportunity comes

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,880
from people who have gone through this

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,720
process to now step up and show others

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,120
and most importantly you want to be able

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,559
to recognize this

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,559
so when we think about training

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,320
training has the two components that you

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,120
saw earlier there's the learning

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,120
and the applying doing it incrementally

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,559
is a great way to make this a part of

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,679
the regular daily work

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,280
and this does work when you

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,120
work with your developers to let them

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,720
know as you're going through these

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,559
things when you're in your sprint cycle

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,880
think about the learn one teach one

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,120
approach right or you may call it

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,559
shared programming but giving your

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,400
developers and architects

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,600
and everybody on the off side the

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,200
bandwidth

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,440
to become trainers if you think about it

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,799
from the information that you already

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,280
have there

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,080
what you're gaining from a conference

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,600
like this is a library of information

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,720
if you question wait a minute we don't

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,320
really have a whole lot of training

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,799
resources actually you do you're on a

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,159
conference right now that has tons

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,559
these are teachable things that you can

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,960
take so why not take something like this

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,400
back

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,720
and put it into a security context

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,200
within your organization

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,280
now internally before covid obviously

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,480
this was best done for our organization

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,919
we would get together with rapid

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,159
development sessions

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,000
one department could propose a lunch and

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,360
learn and send the broadcast out hey

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,799
we'd like to show you the latest things

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,600
we've done at kubernetes and here's some

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,840
really cool things

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,640
you might find useful these are things

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,120
that you can take

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,480
in these small group sessions obviously

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,559
from the work from home

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
model now we have this has changed the

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,039
mode of delivery

00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,080
but it's still the same so

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,200
incorporating a learning program is

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
probably the biggest challenge to

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,480
overcome

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,280
now many organizations have things like

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,960
precipio

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,760
they have things like learner source

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,000
safari this is good content

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,679
for some core things but you need to

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,200
incorporate it

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,880
because it's got to be current and it

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,720
needs to be relevant

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,320
again a great reference point is to all

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,400
things open the content we have here you

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,559
can take these things

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,080
and integrate them if you're in an

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,640
organization where you don't have access

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,799
to

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,679
some of the bigger platforms you can

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,880
still

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,440
construct your own off open source

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,720
items how you can use things such as

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
common cms

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,240
to be able to set up your own learn

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,360
library the purpose is

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,559
you agree upon a shared organization and

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,919
with a plan like this

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,520
it's easier to be able to go to the

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,400
c-suite and say you know we would like

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,039
to be able to

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,679
hire some trained to train our resources

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,320
and

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,360
teach our most senior people how to

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,600
become a trainer

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,360
how do you put together something that

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,520
can be delivered in training content

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,720
right don't worry about perfection but

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,480
focus on

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,000
progress right because this is part of

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,080
the growth path and it's a growth

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,320
mindset

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,080
the benefit from this that is this comes

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,400
from within

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,280
nobody knows your organization better

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,799
than you do

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,320
you're inside of this thing you're

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,120
learning it you're living it and you're

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,240
sharing it

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,159
and sh and sharing those with around you

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,600
is how you can drive this so if you

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,000
don't have the budget for commercial

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,760
learning

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,600
products you can look at these senior

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,960
individuals this is the greatest

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,120
investment that you could ever have

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,440
because this small amount of time

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,919
in teaching one is going to pay off

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,840
quickly

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,280
now keep in mind that realistically this

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,159
is an incremental process

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,559
so i'll show you in just a second how we

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,280
actually set this up and structured it

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,039
using github and this is an incremental

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,280
thing where we defined

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,080
levels that were considered novice and

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,440
intermediate

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,720
and more advanced skill sets and we did

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,840
it from a community

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,679
learned approach we talked to people

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,080
across the organization

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,559
we talked to the senior engineers the

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,080
senior architects the senior analysts

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,600
what were the things in the use cases

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,760
that were on their mind that they had

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,400
constantly coming to them if you're not

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,559
sure where to start with this

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,679
refer to alyssa's approach on that you

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,400
can start with things like threat

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,960
modeling

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,679
and automation don't try to ball the

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,679
ocean

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,360
because that's too much but you can take

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,760
it on a piecemeal approach

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,400
and i did this internally i created an

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,159
internal

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
course and then i presented it over and

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,240
over again the more i presented it the

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,640
more comfortable i got with presenting

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,280
it

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,960
and the more reach that it happened it

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,640
got out to everybody in there and now

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,720
i'm happy to say that

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,480
some of the best and the brightest which

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,480
you will recognize and see

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,760
stepped up and said hey i really get

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,520
this i like this now they're trainers

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,799
now this program is starting to take a

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,360
path forward because

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,440
now there are more people who are able

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,279
to deliver this content

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,880
again don't overdo it when you try to

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,000
write these things right understand

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,559
where the skill sets are

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,080
and then build incrementally right if

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,039
you think about threat modeling

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,840
and you take it in that approach where

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,600
you

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,200
address a small piece at a time and you

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,200
keep going through the cycle

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
you create these channels of topics you

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,880
could incrementally increase the levels

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,320
of learning

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,559
by making the challenges a little bit

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,679
harder right and that's what we did

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,520
the first ones were okay take one

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,240
component of your application

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,919
demonstrate what a boundary is around it

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,600
and list out two things that could

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,960
possibly be vulnerabilities and then

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,520
what would you do about them

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,279
now create those use cases and do that

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,520
in a pull request to github

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,559
bam you're done as a developer you're

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,159
already doing these things

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,400
and even some operation teams i've seen

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,960
do this now this is part of the daily

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,799
work

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,880
and this is how we started this progress

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,799
and got this rolling right

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,480
this is the application of it it's

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,200
taking what you've learned

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,960
not showing it we all do our code pull

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,559
requests and submitting them

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,000
this is a great way to keep that and it

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,039
keeps the core knowledge

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,760
within that so i started with these four

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,760
topics

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,440
just to get the ball rolling and the

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,760
purpose was

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,679
to have them do two things generate

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,679
artifacts to show their knowledge

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,799
and complete the work that's in the same

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,039
vein as

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,919
what they do already so starting with

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,000
threat modeling

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,600
and it didn't have to be the whole thing

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,640
but get them started on pieces of their

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,240
application as part of their sprints

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,760
for those who were really keen on

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,200
driving it forward

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
many of them were saying hey what about

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
these vulnerabilities that we have i

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,279
would really like to look

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,200
further into that you know what that's a

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,960
great use case for something teachable

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,559
that you could share

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,159
take one of these vulnerabilities that

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,520
you found and

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,360
share some documentation and some

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,159
research on it teach the rest of us what

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,279
you learned

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,200
right automated security scanning

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,799
do you have something that's useful to

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,120
share with how you do your sas

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,240
your dast did you implement an i asked

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,320
solution

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,679
can you show the rest of us this is

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,120
demonstrating knowledge and it's

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,880
applying it

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,200
and it's a short time investment with

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,960
what you do the benefit is this is

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,480
actually relevant to your daily tasks so

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,400
this isn't doing it off the side of the

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,000
desk and asking you out of your way

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,840
as a developer as we see about these

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,600
things we're already doing these things

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,279
and then lastly this is where the other

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,240
part of the recommendations

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,279
can come into key things like the sock

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,200
and the sir

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,640
the operations side of this thing where

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
do we get these alerts

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,400
these are all use cases that can be

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,080
written up as simple course

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:38,559
work to share and train with each other

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,320
now it's keyed to understanding that

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,440
there has to be a little bit of a system

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,120
of checks and balances in this thing so

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,840
using if you want to use github or

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,679
whatever you have for a repository

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,679
you can use these things my point is

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,400
that this is how we adopted this

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,360
so what we had individuals do as they

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,799
would submit

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,799
their cases from their learning they

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,600
would do a pull request

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,520
our senior engineers and developers

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,520
would comment on these things

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,880
yeah and i saw an interesting response

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,400
in a chat earlier

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,320
anybody that approves a poor question

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,200
doesn't comment on it probably didn't

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,919
read the pull request

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,520
that's probably not true in that but

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,360
getting them involved with that

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,279
is a real good way to use this because

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,480
this is teachable we take this content

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,559
now and we share it

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,840
now it's in our repos everybody has

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,399
access to it

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,200
and so all we ask is for these senior

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,880
individuals

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,200
evaluate the correctness of the solution

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,600
did they meet the requirements

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,360
and not everybody can be a developer on

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,440
this but everybody can have input

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,240
so it's key to make sure that you invite

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,240
them to contribute

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,399
so in considering this as the artifacts

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,240
what we did

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,880
was we said we want you to generate your

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,159
playbook you can set your repository up

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,320
to do this

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,840
outline the expectations these can come

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,159
from your planning sessions that you

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,480
have

00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,200
right which artifacts are going to mean

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,559
to complete it

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,120
for example like i said the threat

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,720
modeling the very simple novice level

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,159
was take a small component of your

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,320
system

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,520
throw off draw a boundary around it and

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,960
list out two things that could be

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,720
vulnerabilities and then write up use

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,240
cases put them into your backlog

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,840
what are you going to do about them it's

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,279
just that simple you're already doing it

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,960
as part of your sprint

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,399
only now there's a bigger benefit to it

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,919
because now you'll get credit within

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,360
this program

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,360
and i'll outline that in just a minute

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:30,559
how we did that so as you set these up

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,399
and you have these artifacts submitted

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,240
now this practice becomes more than just

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,760
educational now it's application

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,600
they're already doing this is what they

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,279
do daily right so it just becomes

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,000
reinforcement and it's not just busy

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,159
work

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,440
as they submit their items and put them

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,960
into the repos

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,039
we completely track this entire

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,799
repository with several folks from

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,159
different areas of the organization and

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,080
they give their input

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,000
and they keep improving these

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,919
requirements so everybody

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,279
can see openly and they contribute if

00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,880
they have an idea

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,880
hey this would be a great course what if

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,720
we wrote something on this

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,880
great would you mind up writing a pr for

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,679
that and submit it we'll all contribute

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,440
we'll all do it all right the doing

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,200
obviously is taking all that knowledge

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,640
and then applying it

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,960
so what i said earlier about using

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,240
playbooks is getting that pattern

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,559
this is still part of your daily

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,520
productive work but now it's muscle

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,279
memory because

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,720
now that playbook is now part of your

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,240
team's spread cycle

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,840
again there's a point to this and i'll

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,760
tell you just a minute because this is

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,760
the ownership part

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,480
the first few cycles you go through will

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,600
be a bit cumbersome yes

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,960
but as you begin sharing these out to

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,080
the teams now you have the ability to

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,039
adopt a common theme here and that theme

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,200
is the culture

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,799
you've now actually taken what's part of

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,960
the daily work

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,640
setting this up so they're recognized

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,880
for what they're doing without realizing

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,200
it

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,559
doing it and the key comes through the

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,360
very last pillar which i'll tell you

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,279
about in just a minute

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,559
but it's important to understand that

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,240
your company culture

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,320
has got to be supportive of this

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,080
everybody can contribute it's not just

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,760
the devs it's not just security it's the

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,679
ops it's

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,799
as alyssa said why aren't more people

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,799
come to the table

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,720
i don't know but you should invite them

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,200
you should give them the ability to give

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,279
input

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,679
and drive that if a culture

00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,080
focuses on punishing failure rather than

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,480
saying what can we learn from this

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,840
then we really haven't learned anything

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,360
from when the light bulb was invented

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
and there was ten thousand ways to

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,440
figure out how

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,760
not to make one right having a culture

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,039
where failure is always an option we're

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,080
going to take that as a learning thing

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,039
and we're going to take that as teaching

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,320
things and then we're going to share

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,440
that

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,039
because with ownership you've got to be

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,120
able to stand up and lead

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,559
so you want to give them to do this

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,840
broadcasting this out

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,159
internally and externally giving them

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,600
the recognition for standing up and

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,640
sharing these things

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,039
this invokes confidence

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,799
and it's also a growth mindset and we

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,880
know that growth mindsets

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,840
are how organizations stay flexible

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,919
right

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,519
it also opens up different perspectives

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,279
because now we can all look at the good

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,679
and the bad and the ugly

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,880
and you made a good point don't take the

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,440
code personally

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,640
right there's always ways to prove it we

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,840
all can contribute to this

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,240
i love how she said that look at this

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,120
objectively from how to improve the

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,240
process

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,960
and everybody can contribute

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,480
lastly it's important to understand that

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,440
you've got to validate

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,159
the accomplishment recognizing creating

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,720
programs

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,480
where you can share these successes if

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,960
you have an internal

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,159
recognition program make sure that you

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,200
put those out there make sure you

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,080
broadcast this

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,679
and just as importantly look at things

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,600
like digital badges

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,360
there are systems out there like acclaim

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,279
and credly i know there's where you can

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,360
create these digital badges you can look

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,279
for examples from microsoft you can look

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,840
for examples from amazon

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,320
and ibm they all offer these digital

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
badges

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,440
and the advantage to this that we

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,000
realized is

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,440
this actually creates a culture of

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,799
recognition

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,039
for accomplishments and the program that

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,159
we have has four basic levels

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,159
across several different key areas it's

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,399
not just security it's also about

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,240
improving some of the devops processes

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,600
there's even some channels that talk

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,960
about how to improve the business

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
processes from this and there'll be

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,000
badges created from this

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,279
validating this accomplishment is what's

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,360
going to do

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,799
more for your organization because you

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,039
recharge them

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,320
and motivate them to do more and reward

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,240
them for the effort and it's part of

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,679
your culture

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,360
you don't have to be the smartest person

00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,039
in the room for me that was probably the

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,760
biggest lesson learned

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,039
when i realized wow i'm around a whole

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,679
bunch of smart people

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,960
and together we can all move this much

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,000
faster

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,360
so socializing these best practices

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,799
start out with at least two internal

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,640
platforms that you have in your town

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,399
halls your devops communities

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,360
ask your senior leaders to recognize

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,360
someone it drives that down through this

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,760
but most importantly don't try to do

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,760
this off the side of your desk

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,519
as i said volunteering is nice but

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,519
programs don't get funded that way

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,960
right if we think about what richard

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,039
branson once said

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,559
if you take care of your employees they

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,880
take care of your business

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,480
i love that quote from that guy because

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,480
when you engage your employees and you

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,039
motivate them like this

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,240
an engaged employee is just going to be

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,240
much happier and

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,480
making culture where security is

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,600
something everybody can contribute to

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,200
makes it an even stronger organization

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,960
and so i'm keeping an eye on my time

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,039
here and i'm going to ask the moderator

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,640
to uh if there's any questions if you

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,600
want to open it up

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:57,519
i'm happy to take questions at this time

00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,000
all right eric good uh it says um

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,960
james says the literal definition of

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,760
kung fu

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,380
skill developed through time and effort

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,280
he says i like your sensei already

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,800
[Music]

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,199
yeah i had to get a lot of healing to

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,399
learn that lesson let me tell you

00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:17,839
[Laughter]

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,000
um yeah it's

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,040
it's it's interesting how these cultures

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,520
can come align and

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,480
and this is something i've worked out

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,119
for some time

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,720
um really well-known gentleman in the in

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,079
the devsecops community and

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,839
chris romeo started a program at cisco

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,159
and you should really seek him out and

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,560
learn his story because

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,359
it's really one that is all about the

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,679
culture

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,200
and it's amazing how he drove that and i

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,879
got inspired by that

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,839
and i got inspired by the fact that he

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,159
actually approached it from martial arts

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,040
background

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,800
yeah chris is a good guy he's spoken for

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,359
us a couple times

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,320
a nice guy let's see i'm looking at the

00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,119
comments and i'm

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,240
backing up a little bit uh sean in case

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,599
you've already answered

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,480
i did not see so that was for sean okay

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,599
and then i've got risk management and

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,680
risk

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,440
mitigation larry i'm not sure if that's

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,960
referring to eric or not if you want to

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,000
jump in

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,320
and then jonathan says writing a test

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,680
that confirms that functionality works

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,599
is one piece

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,079
but writing a test that makes sure

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,440
invalid actions are valid

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:31,200
do not work is a whole other thing

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,119
so writing for uh invalid actions and

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,440
values

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,720
oh absolutely that would be a great

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,920
teachable moment

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,440
for everybody uh not not just developers

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,440
you know think about it security is

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,640
about quality we could all learn from

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,760
this

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,880
you know perhaps that old

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,720
um uh

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,960
that old joke about a security

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,440
professional goes into a bar

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,079
and places his order you know that one

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,280
right

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,280
i think i've heard it yeah

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,720
yeah it's it's uh i have a beer

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,480
i have two beers i have three crickets

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,920
i'll have nothing

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,359
awesome awesome uh i'm asking each

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,440
uh each person after their session eric

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:27,839
what's the one thing that you want

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,839
people to take away from your session

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,079
everybody has a place at the table

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,000
even if they feel like they can't

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,720
contribute they can

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,880
one of the most inspirational points of

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,119
adam shostak's

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,560
courses and threat modeling is when he

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,280
goes through one of the points of the

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,880
cycle

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,320
and he says this is all about

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,520
brainstorming

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,520
every input is valid

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,920
that is just like so applicable across

00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,640
more things than your step modeling if

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,599
you think about it

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,119
the culture itself every input is valid

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,920
everybody should contribute to this

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,560
thing

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,880
and we all need to step up to the table

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,800
and to offer our input constructively

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,920
right let's keep this constructive right

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,200
because we're trying to better the

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,599
business we're trying to better the

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,599
culture

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,240
all right great you know you i've heard

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,079
you mentioned place at the table several

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,200
times i'm sure you're aware

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,720
that's mark schwartz's book market mark

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,400
sports photo book

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,240
called a place at the table which

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,240
basically

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,280
confirms what you're talking about bob

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,800
weston says

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,079
off topic listening to a talk by a guy

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,880
from optum

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,500
wearing last year's optum booth handout

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,520
and hand sanitizer holder on a belt loop

00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,520
[Laughter]

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,520
and a co-worker just came and dropped

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,400
off some company branded stuff including

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,800
one of those

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,960
door opening button poking things that

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,119
have gotten popular lately

00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,280
i'm using coincidence thank you bob for

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,280
just that absolute non-seq order

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:08,560
very nicely done let's see larry goetz

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,960
says contributing is key because someone

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,200
may shed a light on an avenue that

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,640
wasn't seen or considered

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,040
that is so true oh my gosh

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,960
yeah we all tend to get into our own

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,920
little box don't we larry

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,920
if we think about developer bias i mean

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,040
bias in general right

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,040
developers aren't the only ones who get

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,079
it physicians get bias right

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,400
everybody gets bias it comes down in the

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,800
software world to pets versus cattle

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,800
right

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,920
like angie said don't get personal about

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,320
it it's code

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,920
i can't count the number of times i've

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,800
watched a module or wrote something

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,800
wrong because

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,960
either i was too tired too sleepy or

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,280
just focused on my own thoughts

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,720
and then when somebody said that's the

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,760
requirement they asked for

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,839
just so you know oops humbling moment

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,000
there thanks

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,880
yeah i went off on a tangent okay let me

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,599
get back on track thank you

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,040

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,280
we will um

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,680

after this so thank you so much

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,599

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,000
you're in your studio already so that's

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,960
kind of

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,480
nice yeah the reality is it's all packed

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,960
up sitting one room over while this room

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,599
gets redone

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,640
