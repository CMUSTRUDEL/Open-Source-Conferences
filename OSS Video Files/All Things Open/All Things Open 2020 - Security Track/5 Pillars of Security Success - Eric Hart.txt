Abstract: A common challenge in organizations is how to keep the topic of security at the forefront but not blow CAPEX or OPEX budgets. Compounded with the industry-wide shortage of cybersecurity talent in the workforce, there is little left to wonder why the increased burden of security keeps moving faster than most can keep up. In this talk I will highlight 5 Pillars for implementing a self-sustaining security education model within any organization that will:

- Convince the C-Suite the investment in talent is worth the effort
- Make the CISO your trusted ally
- Build a sustainable and repeatable framework that is product agnostic
- Recharge and motivate developers to do more and reward them for the effort.
