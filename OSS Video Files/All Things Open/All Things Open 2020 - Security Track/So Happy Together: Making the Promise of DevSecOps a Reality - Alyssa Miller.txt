	Presented by: Alyssa Miller, Snyk
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Security Track

Abstract: It may be hard to believe, but it’s been over a decade since DevOps was introduced. It wasn’t long after that the concept of DevSecOps began to emerge as security practitioners attempted to keep application security practices engaged in software delivery. However, recent studies show that even in organizations that have adopted a DevSecOps model, security is still often viewed as a bottleneck. This can undermine the promise of DevSecOps to deliver a culture of shared responsibility for security.

Hacker, former developer, and application security advocate Alyssa Miller dives into the key issues that keep security shut out of the DevOps Pipeline. She’ll provide insights from her recent research into the state of DevSecOps and Open Source Security and share evidence that indicates organizations are still failing to mature their processes and achieve the ideal shared responsibility culture.

Through her analysis, Alyssa identifies tangible, practical actions that security practitioners can take to successfully enable security practices within the pipeline. Alyssa will demonstrate what steps can be taken to create accountability between Development, Security, and Operations disciplines. Finally, Alyssa delivers a forward-looking viewpoint for what lies beyond DevSecOps, and how this culture can be extended to include the broader business.

	00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,440
thank you everybody for being here

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,200
um i'm really excited to be a part of

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,200
all things open this year uh this is

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,600
actually my first time speaking at

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,880
ato and a little sad that it had to be

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,519
virtual but hey we are where we are

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,599
and not only is that at home doing this

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,359
virtually but we are where we are

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,480
in terms of devsecops devops

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,079
how did we end up in this space where

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,160
did this all come from

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,520
little history lesson for you back in

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,840
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,960
this crazy belgium guy and i call him

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,200
that because well

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,559
he's a colleague and a co-worker so i i

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
can call him that

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,879
uh you know he kind of he was really

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,559
tired of all the headache and

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,280
frustration of trying to deploy

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,840
software and and battling with ops teams

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
and

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,440
so he was going to agile conference and

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,520
he

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,359
ultimately ended up connecting with this

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
guy this is andrew schaefer so

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,559
we've got patrick dubois and andrew

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,720
schaefer

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,159
get together and they start talking

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,720
about this idea of

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,799
how do we bring developers and

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,799
operations together and get them working

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,240
more cohesively

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,960
basically this was the birthplace of

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,119
devops um you know a few years later

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
or actually i guess the next year later

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,840
patrick

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
uh founded devops days and that turned

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,200
into

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,960
a a series of events that occurred

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,240
around the globe so

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,960
devops started to grow you it became a

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,640
really

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,320
powerful buzzword we heard about all

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,600
over the place then around about

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,439
2012 these two guys

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,280
gene kim and josh corman went to rsa

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,840
usa 2012 and gave what is probably

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,200
one of their more infamous talks the

00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,719
security is dead long live devops talk

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,479
and in this they somewhat

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,040
uh you know visionary

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,840
pointed out that if security was moving

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,920
more and more

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,879
into the developers court we had been

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,680
talking about

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,599
push left in security at this point for

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
at least a decade

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,280
but now it was so much different with

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,480
the advent of devops and

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
this idea of ci cd pipelines and and

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,760
things of that nature

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,920
it was a whole new world and these guys

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,480
saw it coming and they called it out

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,040
back in 2012. we're now in 2020 and

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,599
things

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,760
haven't really changed a lot from a

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,599
security perspective

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,080
we still struggle as security

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,239
practitioners to bring security into the

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,400
devops pipeline in a way that developers

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,319
can actually adopt it

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
and there's a lot of reasons there's a

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,640
lot of struggles and today

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,840
we're going to dive into all of that so

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,440
first let me start off with just a

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,480
really quick introduction my name again

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,280
alyssa miller

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,519
if you if we haven't met or we you know

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,599
i realize not everybody knows my name so

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,280
um let me tell you a little bit about me

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,000
i'm a hacker and a researcher first and

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
foremost

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,200
i bought my first computer when i was 12

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
years old

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,560
and you know this is a time when most

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,280
people didn't have computers in their

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,640
homes

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,400
i taught myself basic programming and

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,560
then i taught myself asynchronous modem

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,360
communications

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,879
and serial comms and things like that

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,280
and i had a lot of fun with an

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,720
online service it i there's probably

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,080
some of you out there that will remember

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,200
this company called prodigy um

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,560
so yeah i got my start pretty early on

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,799
um i'm also a security advocate and

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,159
by that this is a term that now has

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,680
actually two meanings for me

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,200
first of all me personally i'm a

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,560
security advocate in that i like to get

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,280
out into the communities

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,040
and talk about security topics i like to

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,840
share my ideas i like to hear others

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,599
ideas

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,200
work together with folks see what we can

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,959
do to come up with better ways to

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,239
address the security of

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,680
in particular our software the second

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,760
meaning to that is that's actually my

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
job title now is application security

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,000
advocate i work for a company called

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,560
sneak

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,080
and sneak just you know we make

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,760
developer tools that

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
help find security issues in

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,599
dependencies

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,400
in your code and your containers and so

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,919
forth

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,359
so i get out and i get to speak about a

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,759
lot of those topics as well and of

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,519
course

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,840
all of that ties together really nicely

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,560
with talking about devsecops

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,120
i am a former developer so when i first

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,919
got into the professional world of tech

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,560
i spent almost 10 years as a software

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,520
developer

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,680
worked um first for a uh a small

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,520
software company then i worked for a

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,560
fortune 200 financial services

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,720
technologies company i'm also the

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
co-host of a podcast called the uncommon

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,120
journey

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,320
um i have two co-hosts uh philip wiley

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,720
and chloe mustaghi

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,960
and we talk to people about how they got

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,080
into their careers and the many

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:03,120
unique stories and paths of how

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,039
people got there so all this to say

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,199
i love to get out and interact with

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,320
folks and share these ideas and to talk

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,759
and to to see what we can do to make

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
things better because when it comes to

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,120
dev

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,759
sec ops that sec piece

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,880
becomes really challenging how do we get

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,600
security

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,199
into our products is it the developers

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
is it the security team

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,800
is it is it operations who is

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,479
responsible for security

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
in fact i wanted to know the answer to

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,080
this so much so

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,240
that for the last two years at sneak

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,560
we've asked a question

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,639
on our survey as part of our state of

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
debt or a state of open source security

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,280
report

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,440
we asked the question and actually two

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,560
questions who's responsible for security

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,039
of your applications

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,680
and who's responsible for the security

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,240
of your infrastructure

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
the answers here are kind of interesting

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,840
so this

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,080
is from the 2020 report the one that we

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,319
released earlier this year

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,360
and what you see here first of all is a

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,520
question that if you look at the

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,680
percentages you can see

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,360
it was a multiple answer question so you

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,960
could choose as many options as you

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
would like

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,160
software security by and large still

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,560
today is put on the shoulders of

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
the developers more so than the security

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,000
team far more so than the operations

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,840
team

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,840
that's kind of a weird imbalance

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,039
honestly you know from a security

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,039
perspective being a security

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,639
practitioner of almost 15 years i look

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,759
at that and i say really

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,080
security only half of you think that

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,160
security has some sort of responsibility

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,639
in securing software

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
and then you look at operations and it

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,680
you know

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,720
when it comes to infrastructure things

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,360
even off a little bit but

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,080
i would expect in reality shouldn't all

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,240
three of these be a hundred percent

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,919
the point of this is we put a lot of

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,479
weight on the shoulders

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,880
of our dev teams to secure our software

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
and we don't put the same expectations

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
on the other two components of that

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,000
thing we call devsecops

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,160
i mean that name didn't just come from

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,280
nowhere it means something developers

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,639
security operations working together

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,520
working towards this idea of a common

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,360
goal or a

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,919
shared responsibility so

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,800
let's talk a minute about what the

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,520
reality of software development is today

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
now sal was up here in the last talking

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
there was a lot of conversation going on

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
around

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,680
open source software and

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,280
the fact of the matter is open source

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
has fundamentally changed software

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,639
development forever

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,319
stop me if you've heard this story

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,599
before here's an 80 lines of code

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,960
java application three java files

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,879
now back when i was a developer if you

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,080
had a 100 000 line of code application

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,720
it meant you wrote 100 000 lines of code

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,280
we all know that's not the case anymore

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,560
in fact

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,479
this 80 line javascript app

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,879
well one of those three files defines

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,879
the dependencies and there's seven

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,800
dependencies that are defined within

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,599
this code

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,000
so we're all familiar with this if

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,120
you've done

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
any java or javascript or even if you

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,039
get into python

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,680
you you you understand the idea of open

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,199
source dependencies

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,960
now the struggle with open source

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,039
dependencies and indeed we were talking

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,440
about this in the chat a little bit

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,520
is that every one of those dependencies

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,800
also has its own sub-dependencies and

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,959
those sub-dependencies have other

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,599
sub-dependencies and on and on and on

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,719
and you have this complex tree of

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,560
dependencies

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,640
and gaining visibility into all that can

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,080
be complex in this case

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,640
those seven direct dependencies

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,200
introduce 59 transitive dependencies

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,480
and suddenly your 80 lines of code turn

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,560
into 713 000 lines of code

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,080
my node.js developers out there you know

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,279
this struggle

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,480
more than anyone you log in and you you

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,320
open up your project

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,320
and npm goes out and starts pulling

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,240
dependencies meanwhile you go off get a

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,279
cup of coffee maybe go out for dinner

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,320
because it's going to be that long

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,640
before that project opens up

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,720
so how do you answer the question what's

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,920
in your software

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,200
you know again in in sal's uh previous

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,480
session you guys were talking about

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,720
equifax

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
and this struts vulnerability that pops

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,760
up and

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,360
you know i guess there's never been a

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
good answer did equifax know it was

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,279
there and didn't fix it or could they

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,839
not even

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,440
tell if it was in that code but the

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,800
reality is when we look at those

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
dependencies

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,399
and when i did some research on this

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,080
using the data from scans at sneak

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,360
what we discovered was that

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:52,560
the vast majority of vulnerabilities

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,160
in java and ruby and npm for javascript

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,000
though more vulnerabilities are coming

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,839
from those indirect dependencies than

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,360
the direct dependencies

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,279
so this is all stuff that your

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,640
developers may not even have direct

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,959
visibility into

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,959
so when we're asking devs to take over

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,959
responsibility of the security

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,839
this is the landscape that we're asking

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,839
them to work in

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,800
but it's not just about devs now is it

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,160
it's not just about writing software

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,279
what about those ops teams what about

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,160
developers role

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,440
in operations i love this quote from

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,279
kelsey hightower

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
it is one of my favorite tweets of all

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,600
time

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,120
yeah you want to roll an application

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,279
platform yeah you just

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,480
need to know a couple technologies here

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,440
they all are and you're going to need

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,440
lots of glue as well

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,640
this is this is the reality think about

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,440
it when you have developers going out

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,440
and

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,279
spitting up their environments we have

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,959
this idea of infrastructure as code we

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,920
have containers now where

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,040
we're we're looking to devs oftentimes

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,200
to

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,399
to build those containers and what does

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,399
a developer do when they're going to

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,959
build a container

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,920
well most often they're going to go out

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,800
to get

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,560
to a docker hub they're going to grab an

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,920
official image and they're going to

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,200
build a container

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,000
based off of that official image

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,279
now i saw a blog a while back where a

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,200
developer was talking about how to

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,160
create secure container images and he

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,640
said

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,320
yeah go you know go get the official

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,040
image from docker

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,160
um go get it from docker hub and you

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,440
know you should be able to trust that

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,839
it's an official image it should be

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,839
secure

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:39,200
well the reality is and doing

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,200
just a little bit of research this year

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,720
for our our state of open source

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,560
security report

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,800
i did some research you can see we

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,120
actually did the last two years running

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,760
we looked at the top 10 container images

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,720
official images in docker hub

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,040
and we looked at the number of

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,079
vulnerabilities in each so here i'm just

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,480
pulling the the

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,279
uh the latest tag so i pulled node

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,320
latest postgres latest etc etc

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,399
and i ran them through

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,240
uh the vulnerability tool to look at

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,079
what vulnerabilities existed

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,920
and as you can see there are a large

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,279
significant number of vulnerabilities

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,040
across all of these

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,560
now node throws it way out of whack

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,320
that's because node uses a

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,320
an extremely vulnerable version of

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,360
debian debian's not the greatest about

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,200
publishing

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,839
uh patches on a regular recurring basis

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,480
so they have a lot of vulnerabilities

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
but

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,839
don't let that outlier let distract you

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,600
from all of these others to postgres set

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,079
78 vulnerabilities even when we get down

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,000
to

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,600
say my sequel 67 i this is the challenge

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,680
you can't just assume

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,079
that because it's an official image in

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,399
docker hub that it's secure

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,839
so how do we expect our devs to be able

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,200
to secure these environments that

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,160
they're building how do we expect the

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,399
ops folks

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,079
to understand and be able to secure

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,680
these container images that are supplied

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,279
to them

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,000
it's challenging but that's why we have

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,320
a security team

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
right i mean security is out there

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,639
they're they're there to make sure

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,320
everything's secure

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,920
and it's not like security has a lot to

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
deal with i mean they're just dealing

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,839
with perimeter security network security

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,360
endpoint security application security

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,160
data security policy management

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,000
operations

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,000
monitoring response and prevention right

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,920
the fact of the matter is we have so

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,639
much

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,399
to deal with in terms of constantly

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,800
evolving technologies

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,560
constantly growing ecosystems within the

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,600
open source community

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,040
we can't put this on any one

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,680
team so

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,160
how do we start to improve upon this how

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,800
do we

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,680
build towards that promise that when you

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
know we

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,120
conceived of this notion of devops and

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,279
then devsecops

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,639
quickly followed how do we how do we

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,240
take the promise

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,240
of this environment in which we could

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,040
deploy software quickly and

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,279
and frictionlessly and how do we bring

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,120
security into that mix to make sure that

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,760
the products that we're producing

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,519
the code that we're releasing is stable

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,519
and secure and protects

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,000
the privacy and the security of our

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,399
users and our organization

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,320
this is the challenge we are up against

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,920
and there are some key reasons why we've

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,760
ended up here and there are some very

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,480
tangible things that we can do

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,360
to start to get better so let's start to

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,360
talk about those

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,880
now when we talk devsecops or even

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,880
devops one of the things that we

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,519
tend to do we become really hyper

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,639
focused

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,040
on this green one the one to the lower

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,880
right

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:52,399
over here tooling

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,279
when we talk devsecops all too

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,959
often we become hyper focused on how do

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,800
we automate the pipeline we have to

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,560
build automation in the pipeline

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,000
we want things to go fast so everything

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,399
has to be automated

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,880
and that becomes the heart and soul of

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,399
our focus i have been to countless

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,040
devops and ci cd talks in the last five

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,079
years

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,920
that focused on nothing but how do you

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,440
implement tools how do we automate

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,360
better how do we use

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,720
all these awesome technologies that

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,279
exist on the market

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,079
and make them all an automated piece of

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,920
the pipeline

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,240
forget about the rest of this we forget

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,399
that when patrick dubois

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,079
first started talking about this concept

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,480
of devops before he even called it

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,040
devops

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,000
it was about culture it was about all of

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
these areas working

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,160
together so yes we need automation we

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,079
need cool tools and technology that work

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,199
but we need the processes and the people

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,040
that support it

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,000
we need that governance that sits on top

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,279
of it and monitors and ensures that

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,240
we're getting the successes out of

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,000
this paradigm if you don't believe me

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,720
about how hyper focused we become

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,800
on the idea of tooling go out to google

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,279
analytics and do a look at the search

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,480
term for devsecops

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,320
the top 20 searches containing devsecops

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,480
well the first of course is devsecops

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,120
the second is what is devsecops

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,519
the third is devsecops tools

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,800
you don't see practices and methodology

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,920
show up until

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,959
number nine and number 10. deaf

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,959
psychopath rules

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,800
those don't show up until number 12.

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,160
devsecops culture

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,680
that's like the 14th hit

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,160
so we're constantly thinking tools

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,000
but we need to broaden our horizon we

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,880
need to think about

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,079
devsecops as a culture that's bringing

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,759
these teams

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,440
breaking down the silos bringing those

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,199
teams together and

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,480
building this culture of shared

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,360
responsibility

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,759
where developers operations security

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,600
other people from the business

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,360
are all a part of making sure that we

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,959
deliver software quickly

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,959
that it's stable and that it's secure

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,600
that's the heart and soul of how we get

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,679
to devsecops

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,360
so let's look at the challenge a little

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,679
bit more in depth

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,439
we're back to our infinity again right

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,480
we can't talk devops and devsecops and

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:25,919
not talk about the infinity loop

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,919
but we have these phases of the pipeline

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,120
and we've been talking for a really long

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,760
time

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,520
insecurity in fact i would i would say

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,240
it's been two decades now we've been

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,720
talking about this idea of pushing left

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,080
how do we push securities influence

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,679
earlier

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,240
into the phases of development

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,679
we've been doing that for a long time

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,440
but

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,520
in the last 10 years we've seen some

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,720
conflict emotions

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,600
as we've run into things like containers

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,600
and infrastructures code kubernetes

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,880
serverless environments where things are

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,880
being more and more defined by the

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,320
developers what we see is that influence

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,440
of the development team is pushing

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,440
further right

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,480
they are getting closer and closer and

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,520
indeed into and beyond the deploy stages

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,720
of the pipeline and let's

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,799
again let's not forget about our

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,559
operations teams

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,720
they've had to really push up the stack

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,320
no longer can they just focus on

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,000
operating systems and hardware

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,240
they have to be aware that their

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,400
infrastructure exists

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,440
in code they have to understand that

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,000
code so they're pushing

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,200
up the stack and understanding things at

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,320
a higher layer

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,360
than they've ever had to before and so

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,720
with all of these

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,919
motions comes the business now pushing

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,440
down

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,520
the business is getting more and more

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,440
involved in the pipeline because we've

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,280
got business people writing our user

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,480
stories putting them in our backlogs

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,480
being a part of that process they're

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,039
driving our timelines more so than they

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,200
ever have in the past

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,280
and so you have all of these conflicting

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,880
motions and trying to resolve this and

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,600
bring security into this an incredible

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,200
way is something we really struggle with

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,200
now why do we struggle with security

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,120
how do we make security better the first

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,919
thing we as security practitioners need

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,760
to focus on

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:27,520
is the idea of frictionless enablement

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,799
how do i enable my developers to take on

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,240
security practices in a way that's

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,799
frictionless to them

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,720
in a way that doesn't introduce

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,840
complexities and frustrations and things

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
that are ultimately going to cause them

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,280
just to bypass my security practices

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,200
uh short shift them do them in ways that

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,080
aren't appropriate or aren't sufficient

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,080
not take a comprehensive approach to

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,559
this how do i get there

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,280
well i've been to a lot of devsecops

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,240
talks

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,840
given by security people and we all too

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,679
often in security we think about

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,960
security in terms of gates

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,880
we've been doing this as long as i've

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,080
been in security you know

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,720
you you uh you you start to

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,159
build up maybe a sprint and while we

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,600
need to do threat modeling we need to

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,280
look at the whole system and we need to

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,880
threat model it out we need to

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,720
build all these complex diagrams and

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,080
really understand it and and then only

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,440
when we're done with that can we move

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,960
into coding because we have to have

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,799
these long design cycles where we look

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,720
at all the threats and we know how

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,559
how they're going to affect the system

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,240
and then once once you commit your code

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,240
well now we've got to run those

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,480
those static code analysis tools and the

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,919
software composition analysis tools

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,360
that look at your code and make sure

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,799
that it's secure and oh by the way they

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,080
take days to run and they come back with

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,240
all sorts of issues

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,159
and now you have to address those and

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,360
then we're going to build and test but

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,200
part of that testing well we've got to

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,760
do dynamic application testing so we've

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,960
got our das

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,120
tools those are going to run they're

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,760
going to create all sorts of other flaws

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,280
that now

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,640
we have to decide are we going to fix

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,919
those in this sprint are we going to

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
wait until another sprint

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,280
are we going to add them to the backlog

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,120
as bugs how are we going to handle those

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,039
and then oh we deploy but now after we

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,480
deploy we got to run our penetration

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,440
test and when we do those

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,039
well we could end up defining even more

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,320
uh flaws that need to be logged to our

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,760
backlog because of course we found

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,400
vulnerabilities in production that we

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,640
didn't see sooner

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,080
yeah that's a mouthful it's crazy it's a

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,760
lot of long feedback

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,520
loops and any one of those feedback

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,200
loops can push us backward in the

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,240
pipeline

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,120
setting up security gates breaks dev ops

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,320
period end of story no two ways about it

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,760
if you're in security and you're

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,600
thinking that you can stand here as a

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,799
gate between the phases of your pipeline

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,240
you're already fighting a losing battle

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,400
the fact of the matter is if we want to

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,400
bring security into devsecops

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,240
we need to think about it in a whole

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
different way we need to move away from

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,880
this idea of gates between

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,679
phases of the pipeline and we need to

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,679
ensure

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,520
that our practices that we want our

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,400
developers to be involved in

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,440
are built in as inherent components to

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,440
those phases

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,679
how does threat modeling become an

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,159
integral part of our backlog

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,760
how to sca and creating an s-bomb a

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,679
software bill of materials

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,440
how does that become part of our coding

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,000
and committing cycle

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,600
how do we move sas and das into our

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,159
build and test cycle

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,679
such that it's just an integrated piece

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,840
it's not this

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,440
this gate that we're going to run at the

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,120
end but instead we speed up that

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,280
feedback and make sure that developers

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,919
are getting that in real time

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,880
how do we bring container security at

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,799
the point that we're

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,159
deploying and ensure that those

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,679
containers that we're throwing out into

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,679
our kubernetes environments

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,360
actually are secure and that our

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,520
kubernetes clusters are

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,600
are configured properly to secure those

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,799
containers

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,799
and how do we make sure that our

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,000
monitoring and pen testing

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,080
progresses forward this is what we need

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,280
to be doing as security people

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,480
and the in order to make this happen

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,600
we need to be able to demonstrate what

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,520
value it is that security brings to the

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,360
organization

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,640
and believe it or not security does

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,120
bring value

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,000
to the devsecops pipeline and it's more

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,840
than just

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,840
preventing attacks

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,919
first of all when we build security in

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,400
in this way it further streamlines the

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,000
delivery pipeline we no longer have

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:23,440
those long feedback cycles it obviously

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,360
helps us increase our security posture

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,720
and make our security posture better

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,720
because in a devsecops world we've got

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,200
developers and operations and security

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,039
working together and collaborating

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,440
and it's been shown time and again what

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,720
that collaboration can do both in terms

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,360
of making security posture stronger

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,039
as well as reducing burnout so how can

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,559
we use devsecops

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,400
to better the organization

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,640
by building the devsecops culture we're

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,159
also empowering developers to engage in

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,080
those security practices

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,200
and by doing so early on in those

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,039
development phases

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,120
we now reduce the costs and it also and

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,559
as we do this our overall dev ops

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,279
maturity increases

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,400
as well so we become stronger in

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,080
building towards

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,520
that kind of utopia that so many of us

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,679
think about when we think devops we

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,600
think cicd all the time

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,480
we mature toward that by bringing

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,640
security into that conversation

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,960
we also reduce the size of our backlogs

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,840
which improves our delivery

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,880
and overall trust across the entire

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,760
organization

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
grows and is fostered as we build out

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,720
this

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,120
culture of devsec devsecops so when we

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,200
talk about driving security into devops

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,480
this is the value we bring

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,240
when you're trying to bring that

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,919
initiative to your executives

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,520
and to your development teams into the

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,520
business and you're saying hey

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,840
we need to do this security thing as

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,840
part of the pipeline

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,880
this is where you start to build that

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,120
value this is where you start to see

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,559
that they support you because now it's

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,840
not just hey we're trying to prevent

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,320
this nebulous thing that we have trouble

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,360
quantifying you know

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,440
um i'm thinking again back to sales

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,120
uh talk prior to this and the message

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,960
that lincoln had about how do we

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,200
quantify that it is a difficult thing to

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,760
quantify our technical debt

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,679
so from a security perspective stop

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,240
thinking about it in terms of preventing

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,159
debt

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,559
start thinking about it instead of how

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,000
do we build value for the business

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,120
because when you go to your executives

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,640
that's what they want to hear about

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,720
anyway

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,919
now let's talk a little bit about some

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,480
of that collaboration in particular

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,400
puppet and circle ci released their 2019

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,559
state of devops report and one of the

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,559
things they looked at

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:43,679
was what activities

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,080
are often conducted in the

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,279
pipeline versus what activities bring

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,919
the most value

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,600
in terms of security posture and you see

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,960
here they laid it out in a quadrant

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,120
and you've got the frequency of the

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,159
practice is conducted it goes up the

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,039
y-axis

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,000
the x-axis is that in that practices

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,279
importance

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,720
on improving security posture

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,480
now if you look at the one that i've

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,840
circled here i know it's kind of hard to

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,159
read it's a little bit of an eye chart i

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,320
apologize for that

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,200
but that says security and dev teams

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,200
collaborating on threat models

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,480
what they found was these collaborative

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,039
security

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,480
practices that groups work together and

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,159
engage in

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,279
that collaboration built more

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,679
strength in their security posture than

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,320
any of the other well-accepted

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,000
well-understood security practices

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,159
far better than some of the most

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,919
commonly used ones

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,279
i mean you look at static code analysis

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,000
you see it's way up here in the far left

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,559
meaning we do it a lot but it's not

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,559
really driving a lot of value

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,640
we see penetration testing falls in that

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,640
same quadrant

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,919
so the things that we're doing a lot of

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,520
because we've been

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,360
automating them yeah we're able to

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,279
accomplish those in our pipelines

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,720
but they're maybe not contributing to

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,159
the security posture in the way that

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,159
we'd hoped they would

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,840
do they contribute yes absolutely i'm

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,440
not telling you that we shouldn't do sas

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,080
we shouldn't do dast we shouldn't do pen

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,360
tests

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,000
yes these are important things but there

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,399
are only

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,080
one piece and we need to focus on where

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,840
we get the most bang for the buck

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,080
and getting that bang for the buck is in

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,679
the collaboration it's not in handing

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,320
our dell developers

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,120
a sas tool and saying here thou must run

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,640
this every time you check in code

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,640
that doesn't get us to improvement

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,080
so it's time that we start thinking

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,919
differently

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,200
and one of the examples i'm going to use

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,919
is this idea of threat modeling

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,360
because threat modeling has this

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,200
capability to

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,720
build collaboration and it drives such a

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,080
phenomenal growth in security posture

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,200
but we got to think about it differently

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,880
because when you think about threat

00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,760
modeling in the traditional sense it's a

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,360
nightmare

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,440
and in fact i've had developers tell me

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,200
all the time that they feel like you

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
cannot do threat modeling in devops

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,360
because threat modeling

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,880
breaks devops and i don't disagree when

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
we talk about threat modeling in the

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,559
traditional sense

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,320
absolutely it doesn't work it requires a

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,919
long design cycle that we just don't

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,399
have when we're working in a devops

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,399
environment

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,120
traditional threat modeling starts off

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,960
with this thing you see in the upper

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,559
left that's the data flow diagram

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,399
where we're going to diagram out all the

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,120
trust boundaries and components and data

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,520
stores and

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,840
flows of data that occur within our

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,679
entire system

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,760
then we're going to take those and we're

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,120
going to where i identify the threats

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,559
and we're going to classify those

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,480
according to this model we call

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,080
stride that you see in the upper right

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,039
and that has all of these really

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,760
technical terms of you know spoofing and

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,000
tampering

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,919
and and repudiation denial of service

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,520
all these things that

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,960
do i really want my developers to have

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,440
to understand what all those terms mean

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,679
and in fact when we do threat modeling

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,159
we find some of the most long-standing

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,080
pedantic arguments occur over where does

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,960
a threat fit in the stride model

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,919
why do we care but then you move on you

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,120
have your threats

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,320
and now you can lay them out in an

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
attack tree that we see in the lower

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
right we're going to talk about all the

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,559
different ways

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,000
attackers and threats could come and

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,679
compromise the system

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,120
but then we've got to prioritize those

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,559
attacks so then we use dread

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,159
and we use dread to talk about those

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,799
attacks in terms of damage and

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,640
reproducibility and exploitability

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,480
and oh my gosh this process just goes on

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,200
and on and on and then when we've got it

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,960
all done

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,480
now we're going to categorize everything

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,080
and try to make it simpler because we

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,640
created this thing called a capex

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,720
taxonomy that describes all the possible

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,200
threats the same way that we describe

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,200
uh vulnerabilities in terms of cwes

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,000
oh my gosh does that look simple to you

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,559
no it doesn't look simple to me either

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,240
so when we think about our security

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,640
practices and using dev

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,520
or using excuse me threat modeling as an

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,919
example

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,120
we need to think about this differently

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,279
instead of thinking about how do i

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,320
secure my entire system

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,480
i need to introduce the other ci

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,080
so we've got ci cd we know continuous

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,520
integration continuous deployment

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,120
what about continuous improvement

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,039
stop thinking about security is going to

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,399
secure the entire environment and start

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,159
thinking about security as

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,240
how do i become more secure tomorrow

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,640
than i am today

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,399
when it comes to threat modeling throw

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,960
all of this stuff away

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,480
we're not going to draw these huge

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,360
diagrams that document

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,159
our entire system let's bring threat

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,520
modeling

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,279
into the user story

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,520
and let's look at threat modeling

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,200
instead of

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,240
i'm going to threat model this entire

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,360
system how do i take that one user story

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,200
and define things in plain language

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,960
that my business people who are writing

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,919
the user stories can understand and

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,919
relate to

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,120
and that my devs who are reading the

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,519
stories and then

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,480
planning and coding to meet the needs of

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,039
those stories

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,960
can understand those threats and which

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,000
critical assets and things within the

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,720
environment they apply

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,440
to so that they can build counter

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,200
measures

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,799
as they're coding this is how we need to

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,799
start thinking differently

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,480
so let's look at threat modeling and why

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,559
is threat modeling so crucial

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,760
and how do we think about it differently

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,240
in this case of

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,120
continuous improvement well if i get

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,880
this threat

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,360
information and i build that into my

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,600
user story the first thing i do is i go

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,519
into my planning phase so as a developer

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,320
i've got this story that came to me from

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,200
the backlog

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,720
it's part of my next sprint if i have

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,159
that threat information right in there

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,960
now i can start to plan

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,080
what security requirements i need to

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,880
address as part of the code i'm building

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,600
it's not a mystery to me that oh this

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,519
piece of

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,600
information is particularly crucial to

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,120
the business because my business people

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,480
have defined that and they've defined it

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,720
in

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,039
in very simple to understand plain

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,360
language

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,880
so my threat information informs my

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,679
development terms of the security

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,279
requirements

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,960
well then when i start building now i

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,120
can build security controls that meet

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,200
those requirements

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,159
this is where we can leverage the

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,360
intelligence

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,000
of our developers to build these things

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,480
developers

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,080
understand more than we in security a

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,480
lot of times give them credit for we

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,960
we think developers don't care or don't

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,960
want to be bothered with security

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,480
i know very few developers who are

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
really very happy to find out that their

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,880
code got hacked by

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,640
you know some attacker so

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,399
let's leverage that let's leverage their

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,559
creativity and their intelligence so

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,080
early in the life cycle that we're

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,960
hitting them when they first take a user

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,120
story

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,320
from the backlog they build those

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,559
security controls

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,919
but now because they've they've planned

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,279
out those security requirements they

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,760
built these security controls

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,039
i can prioritize specific test cases in

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,320
my testing phases

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,159
that address those key threats

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,320
this is where collaboration with

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,399
security continues

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,559
not only do they work with security hey

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,320
i need to build these security controls

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,240
let's work collaboratively on that how

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,000
does security work into helping the test

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,600
team build these test cases

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,760
and then when i move to deployment and

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,240
this stuff moves to production

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,640
now i can use that same information as

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,200
propagated throughout my pipeline

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,039
to build the monitoring capabilities

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,320
that i need post deployment

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,559
in my production environments

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,480
so this is just one example using this

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,039
crucial activity of threat modeling to

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,640
say

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,960
hey we can take this and we can build

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,120
this

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,240
in and we can show value that's going to

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,880
streamline

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,120
the rest of the pipeline just by doing

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,960
this one security activity

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,559
when you can bring this to your

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,360
development teams when you can bring

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,760
this

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,279
to your business leaders and say this is

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,559
something we need to start doing because

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,880
it's going to make your development

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:59,200
faster and better

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,200
that wins support that gets adoption

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,720
now we'll talk in a minute about how we

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,519
do this more frictionlessly and how we

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,600
make sure that

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,359
it gets adopted it starts with building

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,200
empathy and culture

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,280
so how do i ensure that my devs and my

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,879
my security folks and my operations

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,919
teams are working together

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,079
start with walking a mile in their shoes

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:24,000
do job shadowing programs

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,079
i've spoken to a number of organizations

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,560
who do this very successfully where

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,200
security they'll take security personnel

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,440
and have them

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,639
spend a week two weeks maybe even a

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,639
month

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,800
working in the dev teams and vice versa

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,480
and operations as well

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,399
this does a couple things it builds

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,240
empathy you start to understand the

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,760
daily struggles that they face that

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,520
maybe as a security person you don't

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,800
understand that that's what devs have to

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,879
deal with all day and

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,879
maybe devs don't see that operations is

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,480
having to deal with this and when a dev

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,800
does something in a certain way how that

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,320
impacts operations

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,480
you build this and you create that

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,320
empathy and you humanize each other and

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,960
it builds that teamwork

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,320
that ultimately is what's crucial for

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,520
developing a culture

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,520
within devsicops

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,720
mutual engagement is crucial i cannot

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,320
stress this one enough when we talk

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,760
about devsecops

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,440
and we have this model where we're

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,040
bringing everybody together in

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,599
shared responsibility common goals

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,000
we should be working together daily

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,079
security and ops should be

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,560
just as involved in your sprint planning

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,599
as the dev team

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,560
retrospectives should include all three

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,240
bring the business into that as well we

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,359
don't need to expand the term to biz

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,000
devsecops

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,520
we don't need to get crazy but bring the

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,920
business bring these teams together

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,599
daily stand-ups maybe i've talked to

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,040
organizations whose daily standups they

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,680
have a security representative and an

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,280
ops representative as well

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,839
why aren't they apart why aren't they

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,720
there to see how they can bring

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,480
their skill sets to bear to help resolve

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,000
blockers that exist in your current

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,680
sprint

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,520
this is where we can do better as

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,160
security in engaging

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:15,680
in that pipeline and then pave the road

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,800
for security how do we make it so that

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,839
the secure

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,880
path is the easy path

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,520
that way we've enabled our teams we've

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,640
given them

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,920
tooling that they can use

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,760
and we've made them accountable

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,359
so they've been unable to do this but

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,160
they're accountable for it so we can

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,640
trust them

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,000
we have the oversight we have that

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,000
governance that's also part of our

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,560
devsecops culture

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,520
but give them the ability with tools

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,880
that they want to use

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,640
think about it when you're selecting a

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,760
tool how often do you ask yourself that

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,359
question if you're selecting any

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,119
security tool often you say

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,800
would a developer want to use this

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,200
a lot of times organizations forget that

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,160
question we're going to go buy a sas

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,000
tool

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,000
but we don't ask the devs what they

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,040
think of it

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,440
that's problematic and we can do better

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,960
so how do we go about picking the right

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,960
tools

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,400
well we need to meet them where they

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,920
live

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,839
and this is where we get back to that

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,920
automation idea right

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,599
when you're looking at tools how do they

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,960
plug into things like the development

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,960
ecosystems how do we get into the ide

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,560
how do we have tools that plug into the

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,359
code repository so when they check in

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,079
their code

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,440
that sca automatically runs and looks at

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,400
all their dependencies and tells them

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,560
what's there

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,440
tells them what vulnerabilities exist in

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,359
a heartbeat

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,960
rather than taking two days and coming

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,560
back with all this information

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,000
so i can check in my code tonight when

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,599
i'm done i can commit it

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,040
i come back the next morning go back to

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,320
work i

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,760
start up i've already got the

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,280
information on where my vulnerabilities

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,920
are

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,040
maybe i do commits throughout the day

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,400
and within minutes

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,200
i've got results how do i push that into

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,480
my ci

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,160
tools how do i get that in jenkins

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,640
encircle ci all all these familiar

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,640
concept all these familiar icons our

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,480
devs know these tools we as security

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,079
should know them too

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,400
jumping in real quick just to give you a

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:21,839
five minute warning okay yep thank you

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,560
so we can do better we can this is where

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,000
automation

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,400
fits but automation only fits and works

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,800
when you've done the necessary steps to

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,880
build that culture

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,839
when you've pushed through and you've

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,920
given them

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,400
that support you've supported all these

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,040
integrations all these toolings

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,000
with processes and the people capability

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,440
to make it all

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,880
mesh and work together

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,400
so i'm going to wrap up here and i'm

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,000
going to get to your questions in just a

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,119
moment

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,720
but i want to leave you with this quote

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,000
from henry ford because this speaks

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,680
right to the heart

00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,400
of what dev sec ops should be

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:03,200
coming together is the beginning so okay

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,760
great we say we're going to do devsecops

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,920
we start to make people work together

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,240
keeping them together is our next step

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,440
that's the progress

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,040
but when we're working together our

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,000
daily engagement

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,920
is as one united team even though we're

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,320
separate silos we're separate teams with

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,640
our

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,560
our separate expertise we work together

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,400
as one unit within devsecops

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,760
that's what makes devsecops successful

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,280
we as security we need to think

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,440
differently about how we do that we

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,960
cannot be the gates we cannot be the

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,119
thing that stands in the way

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,839
of that pipeline moving forward we need

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,160
to be a part of the pipeline

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,880
and we need to enable it to move faster

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,880
not slower

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,800
so with that i'm going to throw this out

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,119
there i'm always open

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,079
to continuing the conversation with you

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,320
folks

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,200
um i definitely invite you to uh

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,640
hit me up on twitter find me on linkedin

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,160
find my website

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,000
uh my blog's a little out of date i'll

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,760
admit um kovid's been tough i haven't

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,760
been doing as much blogging there

00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,599
uh but you can definitely find you know

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,920
some past blogs you'll also find

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,800
links to my speaking engagements and so

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,359
forth

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,880
um but then i want to say thank you

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,800
thank you to all of you to

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,880
all things open for having me to all of

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,839
you for attending today

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,200
and obviously my employer sneak for you

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,000
know allowing me to be here today and

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,720
supporting me

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,440
as i try to bring this message of how we

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,880
can be just

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,880
a little bit better in terms of

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,880
enabling security throughout our

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,359
products and throughout our software

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,200
and just getting a little bit better

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,240
tomorrow than we are today

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,000
because that's what it's all about you

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,119
know listen one of the things that you

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,920
talked about

00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,440
in your presentation which i liked a lot

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,240
and we don't hear enough of

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,720
is the relationships that have to be

00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,160
developed in order to make this work

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,480
i think that you know going through the

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,839
alde devops

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,240
submissions in 2017 i realized that

00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,160
people were starting to understand

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,000
the cultural transformation and the

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,800
relationships that have to happen

00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,040
in order to make it work can you just

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,720
expound on that a little bit

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,040
yeah i mean it's so let me use my own

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,640
personal experience as an example you

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,079
know i've been in security for 15 years

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,880
i was a former developer

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,599
turned security so 15 years ago was the

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,960
last time i professionally wrote code

00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,960
as part of a you know a business system

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,000
that's a long time a lot changed in that

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,560
time

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,200
we didn't have you know things like

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,000
github

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,079
and and get lab and all the rest right

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,440
these repos were very different back

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,160
then i mean they were starting to show

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,520
up on the scene at that point but

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,520
yeah that was a long time ago

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,200
you'd be hard-pressed to find many

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,599
security folks who actually understand

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,599
what a github action is

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,680
and yet isn't a github action one of the

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,440
most powerful things that as a security

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,839
person we can understand

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,560
in trying to automate and drive security

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,800
practices

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,319
into the pipeline you check in your code

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,480
this action runs if

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,400
if your sca tool comes back and says

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,040
you've got 10 vulnerabilities in these

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,400
packages

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,480
it fails and you get an alert so i think

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,680
from that perspective bringing security

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,240
into that conversation

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,640
and energizing security people to really

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,520
understand those finer portions of these

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,359
tools that

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,440
get looked at so often as oh that's a

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,839
developer tool

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,800
how do we bring that to bear how do we

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,359
how do we

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,400
understand that well you start to see

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,000
those things

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,160
when you can actually sit down and work

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,599
side by side with development teams

00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,440
if you're working in a pipeline you're

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,720
going to their daily stand-ups you're

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,560
you're going to their sprint planning

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,960
you're hearing about these things and

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,280
you're gaining perspective in context of

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,440
what those tools are and how

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,440
you could leverage those to help your

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,560
developers complete security practices

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,960
as well

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,480
you know one of the things that we've

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,440
started to realize and i think you would

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,599
agree

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,880
is that security can't be a stand-alone

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,800
silo anymore they

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,800
actually have to be part of the team

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,319
yeah absolutely and that's i mean again

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,480
that's

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,040
what devsecops was supposed to be about

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,040
it's supposed to be breaking down silos

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,880
and bringing people working together

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,960
toward that common objective that

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,720
that shared responsibility as i always

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,880
say and

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,200
yeah if if we're going to say we're

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,319
doing devops

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,640
well we shouldn't have those silos

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,240
yes you have those practices of people

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,599
you have that group of security

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,040
practitioners who really

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,520
have the deep understanding of the

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,640
security piece you have those operations

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,240
folks who really understand the

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,000
infrastructure side you have the devs

00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,000
who obviously

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
you know have a unique understanding of

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,680
what it takes to build software

00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,319
but they should all be working together

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,000
and exchanging those concepts and ideas

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,599
so that they all understand each other's

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,880
world and they can build solutions

00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,079
together

00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,960
there you go good if you will take your

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,880
slides back

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,960
one more just to give people a chance to

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,640
see your contact information

00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,720
there you go so you know nice

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,240
nice presentation lissa very much

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,079
appreciate it

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,599
i appreciate it it was absolutely an

00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,880
honor and a pleasure to be here

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:30,240
um like i said my my first ato so

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,200
i'm uh you know it's definitely great to

00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,119
be able to bring

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,480
a message to honestly a little bit

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,359
different audience than i normally get

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,480
to address so i appreciate that as well

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:43,599
yeah i mean all all

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,760
the um everything else aside the remote

00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,480
environment like this is really allowing

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,480
us to touch

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,839
people that we normally wouldn't touch

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,040
it's kind of

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,200
encouraging in a way very much so

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,720
very much so and i think it's this has

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,000
definitely probably changed just a bit

00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,440
and how i think uh

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,520
events like this will be approached in

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,280
the future i would guess so

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,359
yeah i think they're going to be hybrid

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,119
it would it would make a lot of sense to

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,720
do hybrid events like this

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,880
yeah anyway that's what we're going to

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,680
see thank you so much good to meet you

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:19,680
we will see each other in real space

00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:21,760
that's for sure

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,760
