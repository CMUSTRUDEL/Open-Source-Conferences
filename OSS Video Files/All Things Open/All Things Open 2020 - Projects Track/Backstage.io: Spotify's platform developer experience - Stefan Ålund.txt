so i'm here to talk about backstage

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,160
which is an

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,200
open platform for building developer

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,360
portals

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,880
and it's a product that we initially

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,080
started developing

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,000
at spotify over four years ago and we

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,199
released that's open source in march

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,840
and and uh before i i do a demo

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,320
uh of the actual open source product uh

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,039
i

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,800
will give you just a short like overview

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,320
of what backstage is and what problem it

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,200
tries to solve

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,280
so as i said i'm a i work in what we

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
call the spotify platform organization

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,399
where we basically develop all of our

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,280
infrastructure

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,280
so my customers on a daily basis are

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,559
engineering teams at spotify

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,079
and spotify is organized has very many

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,120
small

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,800
autonomous engineering teams and

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,039
our job who works in the platform

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,120
organization is try to try to make their

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,000
lives as easy as possible

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,800
try to build as much infrastructure that

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,040
makes them

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,920
you know iterate faster on their full

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
product life cycle

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,000
the first question i think is important

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,520
to ask is like what problem is backstage

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,439
trying to solve essentially

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:24,240
the infrastructure open source landscape

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:27,119
is just getting bigger and bigger

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,960
the cncf which is the cloud native

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,479
computing foundation

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,600
has over like almost like 1500 projects

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,000
and we have definitely built our share

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,880
of

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
projects and internal tools at spotify

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,960
over

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,399
200 of those actually and i mean it's

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
fantastic that we have all these

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,079
technologies

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,479
but there's also a sort of a downside

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,479
for this

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,520
so if you look at uh this is actually

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,920
from the cncf and these are

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,759
a few of the little more popular open

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,840
source projects out there

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,000
and as i said these are it's fantastic

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,440
that we have this like plethora of

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,720
tooling available to us but all these

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,760
different tools

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,160
are essentially built as different

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,280
products different things that are meant

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,800
to be used almost

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,640
like on their own and

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,080
what happens when you start to adopt

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,520
more and more of these kind of

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,599
infrastructure tools

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,560
is that it becomes harder and harder for

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,239
an engineer to understand like what are

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,400
all the tools that are available

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,120
and also how do they work so

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,200
basically there's a lot like a what we

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
saw at spotify was that like the more

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,800
tools we added and the more

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,519
infrastructure teams we started to

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,640
create the more complex

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,680
our ecosystem became essentially and it

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,519
actually we came to a point where we saw

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,200
that our engineers

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,040
started to slow down because they

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,159
couldn't find the tools and

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,720
they were basically in order to do basic

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,360
let's say

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,239
a workflow of you know following their

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,000
code

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,000
from commit all the way out into

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,720
production they needed to jump

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,800
between five six seven sometimes eight

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,400
different tools to do that job

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,159
and they lost track and and basically

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,319
the complexity started to slow people

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,239
down

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,959
so we took a radically different

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,680
approach at spotify and we have this

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,799
basically philosophy here that we don't

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,599
think

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,200
that an engineer should have to be

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,080
expert in infrastructure

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,319
in order to be productive so we

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,040
basically think that

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,080
you should be able to do your job and

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,239
focus on you know

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,599
shipping your code shipping your feature

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,440
and the infrastructure

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,480
should be kind of abstracted away for

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,920
you as much as possible

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,879
and that's why we build backstage

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,159
so backstage you can look at it as a

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,879
single pane of glass

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,480
for your whole platform rather than

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,080
asking your engineers to kind of

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,519
understand and know

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
and become experts in various

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,560
infrastructure tools

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,760
there's a single place to go to find all

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,720
your tools

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,440
all the technical documentation all the

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,759
teams

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
basically like solving discoverability

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,040
for your

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,240
tech ecosystem at the same time helping

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
engineers to

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,080
create software in a more opinionated

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,639
way

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,360
and we have really seen that this has

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,560
had a

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,280
dramatic effect on our engineers

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,400
i think one of the my favorite you know

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,440
proof points of this

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,320
is that we used to before we had

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,759
backstage

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,800
we used to measure we still do how long

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,600
it takes to

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,759
get onboarded as a new engineer spotify

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,919
is a company that grows a lot so we add

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,199
a lot of new engineers all the time

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,400
sometimes like you know

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,199
30 40 new engineers per week

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,520
and it's really crucial that they are

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,560
they

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,280
can quickly get up to speed but what we

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,600
saw

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,520
as i talked about our ecosystem was kind

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,400
of growing in complexity

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,080
we actually saw that our engineers were

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,560
starting to slow down

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,080
new engineers that all got onboarded we

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,919
measure it by

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,320
time until you merge your 10th pull

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,320
request

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,680
and basically as we were growing as

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,400
company

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
that number was slightly like steadily

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,880
going up

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,240
so we understood that we need to do

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,360
something about it

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,960
and even if your company is kind of not

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:47,840
on boarding 40 engineers per week

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:50,000
that metric that number like is actually

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,160
a good proxy for kind of measuring the

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,960
overall complexity of your ecosystem

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,319
so if you get that down we believe also

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,919
that it strongly correlates

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,000
like your other engineers will have a

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,600
better job easier to find things

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,960
easier for them to get unstuck and

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
easier for them to get like you know

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,199
ship code into

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
production so we were actually able to

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
cut

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
like that onboarding time down from 55

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,560
days to 22 days

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,560
which is like 55 decrease after

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,759
releasing backstage and consolidating

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
all of our

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,840
infrastructure into one single pane of

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,720
glass

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,560
backstage also helps with standardizing

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,360
the way we create software

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,400
so i said we have a more opinionated way

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,280
we basically have a

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,199
templated solution so you say that if i

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,600
want to create a new microservice

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,600
i don't start from scratch i basically

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,440
go into backstage i click of the

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,560
buttons and then i get a hello world

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,479
uh you know microservice running in

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,880
production with ci built in

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,319
with technical documentation integrated

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,039
we do a mark

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,039
docslight code approach and basically

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,440
all of our opinions about

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,639
how you should develop a microservice at

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
spotify

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,360
are built in to the user to the

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,199
developer experience in backstage

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,759
that makes it pos easy for people to

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,479
basically build

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,319
robust systems at scale and all those

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,759
different systems that we build

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,440
look similar so that we use the same

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,759
technology stack and we

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,599
kind of allow teams to solve their own

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,440
problems but we

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,280
also make sure that there's a

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,759
standardized way where

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:35,360
how we build software at the company

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,599
so how does it all work at the core of

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,919
backstage we have

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,840
this what we call the backstage service

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,720
catalog or the actually a software

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,800
catalog

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,120
it keeps track of all your software your

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,879
microservices your data pipelines your

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,080
websites

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,280
different modules inside your mobile

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,319
applications

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,560
our machine learning models basically

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,639
everything all the different smaller

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,680
software pieces that make up the

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,479
bigger spotify so the service are all

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,280
tracked and

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,960
managed in backstage in this central

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,599
catalog

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,800
and a concept that is really important

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,919
for us is ownership

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,160
so we have a team that owns software

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,840
and that team is responsible for that

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,039
software end-to-end

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,440
and they use backstage to you know debug

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,479
failing data pipelines to look at

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,520
metrics for their services to do

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,719
rollbacks of

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,479
like unhealthy deploys and basically

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,719
everything you can think about in the

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,479
software development like cycle they use

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,719
backstage for that

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,000
and if you look at on the left hand side

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,919
the

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,680
the sort of truth for this for this

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,800
catalog information

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,440
is a small yaml file that we put

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,399
in together with your code and that kind

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,399
of models

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,320
what kind of software it is so in this

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,839
case it's a service and it's named

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,519
podcast api and it

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,519
it has an owner and a bunch of other

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,160
metadata fields

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,760
and let's say changing and exchanging

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,440
the owner of a

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,320
piece of software is basically sending a

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,720
pull request to this metadata file

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,600
to change the owner and then eventually

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,200
backstage

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,399
basically goes in and crawls all these

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,480
metadata files that lives in

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,440
repositories and and brings them

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,360
together in a one

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,360
central place and what is really

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,640
sort of the other dimension of backstage

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,200
i talked about how we

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,880
keep track of our software it's not just

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,160
an accounting system for keeping track

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,480
core software

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,720
what we have really done i think in an

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,360
interesting way is to

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,640
once we have that central repository of

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,200
all the software

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,080
we basically use that as a way to

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,959
integrate

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,560
your the tools you need into that i'm

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,640
going to show that very soon but

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,480
we have a concept that we call plugins

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,040
so instead of

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
let's say jumping into your jenkins

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,320
machines and like you know trying to

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,040
find the build that you were looking for

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,440
or

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,640
going into a kubernetes cluster and like

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,720
you know finding

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,480
uh finding the right cluster and then

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,320
finding like the service that you're

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,959
looking for and then the pods

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,959
we use basically the information

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,079
architecture in the service catalog so

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,480
the user comes in

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,079
through a service and on that service

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,839
there's a number of tools that are

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,800
connected to it

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,800
i'm going to show that later

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,360
and with backstage open source what

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,640
we're really hoping to to achieve here

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,760
is to build

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,440
sort of this marketplace of plugins or

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,240
an ecosystem of plugins

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,920
so if you remember that cncf map that i

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,760
showed you it's really complicated and

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,040
all the uis and all the services are

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
built differently

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,560
what we're trying to do here is

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,720
basically introduce

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,440
a common ux layer on top of all of those

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,040
infrastructure services or

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
infrastructure tools

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
so that when a user uses backstage an

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,480
engineer who

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,640
just want a ship's code they get a

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,279
consistent experience regardless if if

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,920
they're looking at api documentation or

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,519
you know looking at their costs or

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,519
looking at

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,560
you know the recent builds of their

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,200
service

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,160
so all of this is enabled by us

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,560
hopefully

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,680
and it's already starting to happen

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,680
basically enabling

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,760
other companies to start contributing

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,000
these plugins so that the ecosystem

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,800
becomes richer and richer

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,440
long-term goal is that whenever someone

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,680
joins

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,120
like you know comes to backstage

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,920
downloads it

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,480
and they should be free to pick up

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,240
components or sort of plugins

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,600
that are already built for all the tools

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,360
that they're using so if they're using

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,399
circle ci there's a plugin for that if

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,560
you're using

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,440
data dog there's a plugin for that graph

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,839
there's a plugin for that etc etc

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,279
and in that way we have we create this

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,160
ux layer across

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,160
all the different tools

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,200
and we realized that like building this

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,959
ecosystem

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,040
is not something that spotify can do

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,519
ourselves we don't want to and we

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,279
we really think that you know everyone

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,240
has different infrastructure needs

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,160
and we want to create sort of an open

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,000
and vibrant community where people

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,200
contribute to this where spotify is one

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,279
of the contributors but

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,320
one of many so this is one of the

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,519
reasons why we are

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,399
pretty excited to be to announcing

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,040
recently that we have donated backstage

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,120
to

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,720
the cncf the cloud native computing

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,040
foundation

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,639
as a sandbox project which is initial

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,560
the first step

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,880
and look we're hoping to kind of bring

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,880
it through all the way up to graduation

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,240
where you find projects like kubernetes

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,680
and envoy and

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
and prometheus and others

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,440
so the call to action here is like you

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,079
know if this sounds

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,320
exciting uh you are in need of like

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,880
consolidating all your developer tools

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,839
um come and join us backstage idaho and

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,839
and

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,279
we'll help answer your questions and and

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,720
maybe get you

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:11,680
trying out backstage

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:21,839
so with that i promised a demo

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:21,839
and i'll switch over to the demo

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,200
here we go so here's the product uh when

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,079
i

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,720
start uh when i come to the first page i

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,399
can see

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
i've logged into the system i like

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,880
getting a nice welcome

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,160
message in lithuanian we randomly assign

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,600
this so like you know

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,839
get some um different languages in there

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,720
so basically here i can see what are all

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,680
the services

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,000
my websites libraries documentation and

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,600
other kinds of software that my team is

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,360
responsible for

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,360
so here i'm looking at the list of all

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,160
the different services

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,480
that my specific team is owning these

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,880
are

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,720
just example example services and

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,000
microservices

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,639
i can also look at

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,399
like all the services in my company so

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,639
this is one of the advantages of having

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,079
like a central place

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,480
uh we backstage makes it easy for me

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,279
and my teams to manage the software we

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,639
own

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,760
but i can just as easily tap into

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,040
and find everything that exists inside

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,399
our company

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,560
and this is really important when you

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,199
have these autonomous

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,279
teams that are building different pieces

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,720
it's easy to find each other it's easy

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,680
to see the relationship between the

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,199
services

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,880
and it's also importantly easy to kind

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,680
of find

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,920
what apis are available already out

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,600
there in the in my microservice

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,440
architecture so i can

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,040
i don't have to basically re-uh

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
you know re-implement things that are

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,480
already built by other teams that i

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,800
wouldn't have found if i didn't have

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,560
this central repository

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,839
so in here i can then filter let's say i

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,560
want to just see things

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,279
or go services and you know i just get

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
those

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,480
this will obviously be thousands of

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,160
services and you know you can search

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,639
across the fleet but

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,720
for this demo purposes this is

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,720
i can also go to a number of like

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,639
starred services like this is like just

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,320
the ones my favorite ones and um

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,680
the next part of sort of the user

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,639
journey i found the service that i'm

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,199
looking for

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,160
maybe this this sample service i go into

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,040
that

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,519
and what i get here is an overview of

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,279
all the

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,959
important information about this

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,680
specific service

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,360
so i can view the source i can you know

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,279
easily jump over to github to get

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,399
the source of this i can view the

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,320
technical documentation of it

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,800
and i get a bunch of other like you know

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,399
example widgets here that shows like the

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,240
the most important information about

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,279
this service

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,600
and i talked about uh plugins

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:02,079
uh basically instead of giving people

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,120
forcing people to learn jenkins or your

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,880
other ci tool

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,480
and jump in there and log into a

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,160
separate system

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,199
you have it all integrated into one

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,240
place so basically i can click the ci

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,759
button here

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,079
and there i get like all the recent

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,079
builds that were happening for this

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,360
specific service

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,560
similarly if i go to the api tab

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,279
i can see the api of the service and i

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,000
can see that in one consistent view

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,480
same goes for for documentation this

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,639
documentation is super interesting but

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,160
basically what we have in backstage open

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,920
source is a

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,320
docs-like code approach where you

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,360
write your technical documentation about

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
your software

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,560
a service in this case there could be a

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,519
library it's

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,199
you know a website whatever you write

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,360
that in

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,720
in markdown files and put them together

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,440
with your source code

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,320
and then during ci backstage so it

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
publishes

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,440
a nice looking documentation site and

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,199
it's centrally available to find

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,799
and read everyone's documentation in

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,199
backstage

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,559
so it keeps like an engineering focused

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,799
workflow where

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,240
engineers treat documentation just as

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,480
any other code

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,520
but there's a centralized way to find

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,760
and consume

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,480
the documentation about all the software

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,079
in the system

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,319
i don't think this has a kubernetes

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:31,120
plugin no the plug kubernetes

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,919
is not hooked up for this one all right

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,640
so there are other concepts in backstage

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,120
i mentioned

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,240
apis we have all the different uh

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,160
basically

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,320
having a central all these different

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,880
services implements different apis

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,520
and backstage makes it possible for you

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,880
to have a central repository of

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,840
all your apis in this api explorer

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,039
so you can basically go in and look at

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,760
this example the

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,200
spotify open api specification and i can

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,559
look at that

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,000
i can you know see how it's consumed

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,400
but i can also look at let's say this is

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,520
a

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,320
graphql api this particular

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,200
component has a graphql api if i look at

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,880
that

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,960
backstage is smart enough to show a

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,600
different plugin that visualizes sort of

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,080
this

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,760
the graphql specific information so i

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,160
can here go here and i can browse

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,160
through the

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,840
browse to through the graphql model and

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,600
i can you know query it etc

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,080
so this makes it possible to find like

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,520
have a central place for all your things

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,320
but still you know uh make it easy to

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,160
consume

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,880
the apis in in the way they were meant

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,880
to be consumed

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:53,120
another important aspect is so basically

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,480
i've showed you a bunch of tools and how

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,320
they integrate to the

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,200
service catalog or on top of the

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,640
software system that we have

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,360
another thing that we can do in

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,400
backstage is that we can basically build

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,320
a one of these plugins for any kind of

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,640
standalone use case that you have

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,720
so basically inside spotify we have

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,320
built over

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,919
140 different plugins that like hook

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,520
into various different parts of our

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,520
infrastructure

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,760
and one of those examples which we

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,640
recently open sourced is this cost

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,440
insights tool that we have so

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,880
i talked about how engineers basically

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,080
own their own software

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,120
and we um

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,160
that means owning your own costs owning

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,600
your own

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,760
security uh attributes for your services

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,080
or your infrastructure that you own

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,559
basically engineers own this thing end

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,600
to end

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,400
and rather than forcing them to you know

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,720
jump into a separate cost tool and you

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,280
know

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,799
accounting and having managers like poke

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,160
people about

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,840
their cost spend we try to make

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
all of these different attributes part

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,280
of the developer experience

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,520
so in this example you can kind of see

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,320
your specific cloud cost over the past

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,640
six months

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,760
uh you can see like how the trend is

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,559
doing

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,360
and uh interestingly you can also see

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,240
some kind of

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,440
nudges here that like oh this um this

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,320
service here has like

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,039
increased its spend uh all these you

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,880
know

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,880
this is just fake data but this is an

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,360
example of how how it works

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,880
so you can see that oh this service

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,200
actually started to use compute

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,559
engine in in a much bigger way than we

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,880
had previously

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,600
that could be due to a bug or due to you

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,280
know

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,280
normal procedures but we can kind of

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,360
nudge people and show information like

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,000
hey if you if you

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,159
clean this up you could potentially save

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,320
you know one engineer or

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,360
this amount of carbon dioxide or you

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,720
know

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,360
this amount of money for for your

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,720
company so this makes

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,799
cost which is a pretty you know

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,760
boring thing and not really something

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,600
that engineers

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,039
typically want to do and we don't really

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
want to spend a lot of time thinking

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,600
about

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,120
but we make it like integrated as part

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,000
of the developer experience

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,039
and therefore it makes it less

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,280
disruptive

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,120
and and also in some cases actually

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,159
gamifies it

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,760
we do the same thing for migrations

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,440
like tech migrations where we show

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,440
leader boards or different teams who are

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,159
migrated from technology a to technology

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,320
b

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,960
we do the same thing for nudging people

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,840
about you know fixing patching security

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,240
problems

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,240
et cetera

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,200
so how do you build one of these plugins

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,840
then

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
we basically if you go to the backstage

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,039
io

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,919
website we have made it really really

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,320
simple to

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,320
to build one of these plugins and a

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,400
plugin is essentially a small

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,080
web application that runs together with

00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,720
other plugins in a bigger

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,880
single page web application uh and

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,640
we really care about like consistency

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,200
and the experience as i've said before

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,440
so we want all the plugins to be

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,720
looking similar not identical but like

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,520
they should share the same

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,640
ux patterns etc so regardless if you're

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,640
using a

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,360
circle ci plugin or if you're like you

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,640
know looking at your graphs and data dog

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,640
you should you should recognize the

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
tools and they should feel familiar to

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,960
you

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,480
so when you it's not only just very easy

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,240
to build a plugin

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,320
these are just a single command and you

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,520
get like a a plug-in

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,360
but that plug-in that you get uses our

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,960
sort of

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,320
ux guidelines and and this is an example

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,080
of the

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,080
app that i or the plugin that i created

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,760
for all things open there

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,400
um and i get basically like a

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,679
you know hello world type experience out

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,440
of the box with

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,679
where we give you like you know

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,520
different uh

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,520
different ui components that you can

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,960
just use to put together your

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,240
specific use case and we even have

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,000
a very rich like storybook you know ui

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,159
component library where you can

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,280
you know be inspired by other plugins

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,840
and you can

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,960
see you know what the reusable ui

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,840
widgets you have at

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,400
your disposal and you can kind of pick

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,760
and mix

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,600
from existing stuff that

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,440
when you do that you cannot create a

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,440
consistent experience for the end user

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,520
so that's about it i i think we have a

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,559
few

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,000
minutes for

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,120
for q a so i'll stop sharing my screen

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,200
and i'll

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:51,840
leave open the floor to to you all for

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,840
for questions

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,200
just a heads up that you can post

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,240
questions or comments to stefan in one

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,320
of three ways

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:19,840
you can use the chat stream you can use

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:19,840
q a or you can raise your hand

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,200
is there live

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,200
[Music]

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,640
surab i hope i pronounce your name

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,880
correctly um

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,000
you asked about if there's a live demo

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,360
yes one of the

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,600
one of the people in the backstage

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,159
community has actually put up a demo so

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,159
you can go to

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,960
maybe i can type the answer here demo

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,840
dot

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,840
rolly dot so

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,760
and there you can try it out for

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,480
yourself

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,799
this is not kind of a complete demo or

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,360
an

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,400
official demo but it's it's one way to

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,880
have a look at like

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,799
an example an example deployment of

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,960
backstage

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,559
the the important part to bring with you

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,159
is that backstage is a

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:22,640
it's built to be flexible so regardless

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,039
we have it like whatever deployment we

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,960
have of backstage at spotify

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,360
we don't expect companies to have a

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,080
similar need or similar setup

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,279
essentially the view what we want to

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,360
enable is that you

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,840
can create your version of backstage and

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,080
wire it together with your

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,840
the kind of plugins and the core

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,840
components that you want

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,279
i have a question stephen i couldn't

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,360
type into the q a for some reason

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,880
what what was the effort to get the

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,760
portal development

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,679
develop the developer portal to

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,960
production

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,520
i'm just curious it's actually a

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,559
long it's a pretty long effort and it's

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,840
been

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:24,159
in development for uh more than

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,880
four years inside spotify it goes

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:30,720
undergo a number of different iterations

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,960
uh it actually started as a microservice

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,159
catalog like a read-only catalog for

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,559
microservices

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,000
and then it accidentally became a

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,760
platform almost

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,279
and eventually we saw that there's a

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,840
need to centralize

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,279
all the tools and then we can rebuild

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,279
backstage as a

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,320
proper platform with this plugin system

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,760
that i that we now open source

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,080
so it's been a multi-year effort

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,760
and one of the cool things that we have

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,520
enabled inside spotify is that there's

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,000
not just a central team

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,720
that builds the developer portal we

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,360
actually have

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,159
over 60 different teams at spotify who

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,679
builds

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,720
these plugins so it's already like a

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,520
very vibrant

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,960
internal community of like people

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:21,840
contributing and building

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,840
their own parts of backstage

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:38,559
thank you

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,559
any other questions

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,360
i can just pitch that there is if you go

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,159
to the backstage io

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,039
site there is also a bunch of demo

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,559
videos

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,880
uh or we did when we launched backstage

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,200
we did a number of recordings and demos

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,000
of how we use it inside spotify

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,240
the open source project is still you

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,039
know

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,960
i said we have 140 different internal

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,320
plugins and it's been developed over a

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,559
lot of years

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,679
so the open source project is still

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,240
fairly new like

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,240
six seven months uh so it's not as

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,320
feature-rich as our internal version

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,000
but if you want to get on like a sense

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,000
of what this could be in the future or

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,840
what it could you know could become

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,080
to have like this central developer

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,760
portal um check out those videos to get

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:31,840
a better

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,840
30 cents

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:42,080
i have another question so

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,080
yeah you mentioned that the the uh

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,559
the number of days that it took someone

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,080
to get up and running was

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:53,120
went from 55 to 22 days yes i'm curious

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,799
when you did the roi initially

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,960
do you know whether that was about what

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,880
you were going for that's an amazing

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,960
number by the way

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,960
yeah it is really and it's kind of funny

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,960
to when you look at the graph

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,559
it was going up steadily going up and

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,159
then we launched backstage and then it

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,240
started to go down

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,919
i don't think we can claim like all all

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,320
that because there's a lot of different

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,159
you know

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,760
things involved in onboarding an

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,880
engineer but

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,039
and to be to be brutally honest we

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,080
we didn't really use that number as a

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,520
way to

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:28,080
you know motivate backstage

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,039
it was more driven from sort of a

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,440
obsession

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,320
to kind of simplify the lives of our

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,039
engineers

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,320
and we did a lot of user research like

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,039
went out and talked to

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,880
engineers at spotify and we found that

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,919
they were struggling with primarily two

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,840
different things

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,000
first you know this tooling

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,919
proliferation that i talked about

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,200
they just needed to know about all the

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,720
hundreds of different tools that are

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,279
very available

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,279
the second part was that they didn't

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,320
know even where to start looking for

00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:01,279
information so in this

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,559
world of three 400 autonomous teams

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,159
building software and

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,080
everyone documenting their things in

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,120
different ways putting it in markdown

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,520
files and

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,440
google docs and wikis and you know

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,480
private slack channels

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,720
there was no starting point to find

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,640
like tap into the information stream of

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,039
spotify's engineering

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,080
so that was like the second biggest

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,880
problem we saw

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,080
and backstage kind of addresses both

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,720
those

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,520
two problems in the same way it brings

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,559
all the tools in together

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,559
and it also basically brings all of our

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,600
technical documentation into one place

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,600
and standardizes it

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,000
and then we saw kind of as this

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,039
model as more and more teams started

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,159
exposing their

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,000
infrastructure in backstage it

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,840
started to become evident that this was

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,679
a better model both for the teams

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,760
building the actual infrastructure

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,279
as well as the users of you know all

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,279
those things

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,399
and another thing that we are kind of

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,679
looking at

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,360
is what we call t-shaped engineers uh

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,880
so you have your depth where you are

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
let's say you're a back-end developer

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,600
but you

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,120
also have a breath let's say you can do

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,919
a little bit of machine learning or you

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,080
can do

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,960
you know help out with some data science

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,559
work

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,600
and simply by having all your tools in

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,159
one place

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,000
and the tools being consistent like

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,640
dramatically reduces the barrier of

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,640
entry

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,960
for you to do something else as well

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,000
i think in our machine learning space

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,039
this has been really

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,799
interesting to watch i mean you you no

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,880
longer need a phd

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,159
in you know machine learning in order to

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,399
do the basics

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,240
you can do that in in one consistent

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,080
experience in backstage like next to

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,880
your other tools

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,880
you may not get like you know the

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,360
deepest experience but at least you get

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,519
some

00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:01,840
and you can you know start to tap into

00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,840
other domains and become more t-shaped

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,640
just amazing to see a company actually

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,200
invest in something

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,000
like this i mean it makes absolute sense

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,159
do you think that you

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,600
see other companies moving in the

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,799
direction of

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,880
creating uh portals or creating tools

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,760
like that for their engineers

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,440
yeah i think we have before we released

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,960
backstage as open source

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,880
we kind of went out and talked to

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,679
companies in our you know similar to

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,679
spotify

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,039
um you know with you know similar

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,120
technology stacks and similar

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,360
engineering cultures etc

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,320
and what we heard was that they all were

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,480
struggling with

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,840
basically the same problems like

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,240
autonomy

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,200
and and choices is great but it also

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,880
creates chaos

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,880
like if you don't you know standardize

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,799
it if you don't you know

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,640
put some boundaries or guard rails

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,640
around it

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,720
and i think what we what we saw was that

00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,600
we had we had come further than many

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,440
others

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,120
and this is one of the reason why we had

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,159
what we released backstage as open

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,720
source

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,840
and i think just looking at the

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,399
reception that we've had so far with the

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,559
project

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:17,600
i got i i put my name like on on the on

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,320
in the project and we've got we got them

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,120
i think we got like 250 companies or

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,880
something like that

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,039
reaching out to like hey we want to demo

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,240
this we have the same problem

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,080
like we're looking we've been looking

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,720
for a solution like this or like looking

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,080
for a

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,720
solution to this problem and

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,039
yeah so there's definitely a lot of

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,880
companies now that are

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,080
starting to see the need or starting to

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,000
unders you know

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,600
they have seen the need before but now

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,559
they have a you know a starting point

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,039
for a solution

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,760
and they are starting to jump into

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,440
backstage

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,880
starting to use it starting to

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,440
contribute back uh

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,080
with plugins and core features as they

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,519
are sort of

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,159
they're taking backstage and building

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,440
their version of their developer portal

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,640
internally

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,640
so we're pretty excited about that

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,840
that's great

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,320
uh surabiyan um how many of the internal

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,560
plugins do you plan to make open source

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,079
have you had people outside of spotify

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,679
contribute new plugins

00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,520
yeah so first of all uh

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,440
yes we're there's a bunch of different

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,000
teams at spotify who are now

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,280
working to release their plugins as open

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,200
source

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,399
i already demoed a few like we have for

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,159
example the tech docs

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,440
team with technical documentation we

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,320
call it tech talks

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,440
like not the invented name they recently

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,240
open sourced

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,919
that solution as part of backstage i

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,480
also show the cost insights

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,240
tool which is another plugin internally

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,040
that we have open sourced and there's a

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,639
bunch of other

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,079
examples i think we've released let's

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,119
say 10 or so different

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,280
plugins but the reality is that

00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,280
even though spotify uses a lot of you

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,640
know cloud native technologies in open

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,520
source

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,839
a vast amount of those plugins that we

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,320
have

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,560
are spotify internal and they you know

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,520
they expose some legacy system that we

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,240
only that only makes sense for us so i

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,640
think

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,440
it's not at all reasonable to think that

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,839
we will

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,839
you know open source the vast majority

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,200
of those 140 plugins

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,720
and it's not just because we don't want

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,520
to or don't have time to but it's

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,520
actually that

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,800
those are just so specific to spotify

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,680
that they don't wouldn't make sense for

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,960
anyone else

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,240
actually but we are gradually

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,760
sort of adopting more open source

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,480
technologies and and for that

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,920
they can also use more of the plugins

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,920
that are coming from the community

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,760
the other part of your question is uh

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,400
have people outside

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,240
contributed yes so i showed that uh if

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,359
you go to the back stage of io slash

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,280
plugins there's already like a starting

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,599
to become sort of a marketplace or a

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,079
gallery of different things and those

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,280
i think 50 of the plugins have have been

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,280
contributed by

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,480
other companies my favorite example is a

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,520
um and this is where we start to see

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,160
you know real value for also for spotify

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,440
like coming from the community is that

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,480
there was a company who were really

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,960
excited about this

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,880
they had worked on api documentation for

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,400
a very long time

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,079
but they didn't have a central developer

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,760
portal they had a

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,800
basically a api portal with only that

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,720
use case

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,640
so they saw an opportunity to kind of

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,359
take that work that they had and bring

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,160
it in as a plugin in backstage

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,720
and now we have this central you know

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,960
system where you can see a link between

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,079
your stuff in the catalog to the api the

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,359
explosives

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,280
and that's actually not something that

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,480
we had at spotify before

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,119
so we are i mean it's really

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,520
cool to see already now that we can

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,680
start to not only contribute but also

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,839
also like sort of start to import

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,839
innovation from other companies

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:06,560
from the community back into spotify

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,839
that's just one example and there's a

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,839
few more

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,839
answer live

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,960
there's not another question i have

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,839
another one

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,119
i have lots of questions this is really

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,560
interesting are there any plans or

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,320
tending toward

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,160
um since you have plug-ins a model of

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,640
premium plug-ins

00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,760
that people pay for just curious when i

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,480
think plug-ins

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,440
yeah i think that's a really interesting

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,560
uh

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,000
idea and uh not really something that we

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,359
are looking into right now but i mean

00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,880
you can look at

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,640
if you're familiar with the grafana

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,400
project for example uh

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,040
i believe they also have like a plug-in

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,880
marketplace where you know some

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,079
plugins are open source and some are

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,680
kind of you know

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,599
have a license connected to them or you

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,040
have to pay for them

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,359
and i definitely think you know if

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,480
backstage becomes as successful as we

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,200
hope it to be

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,839
i think there will be a market for uh

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,880
you know

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,200
for reselling your developer tooling

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,400
in through a form of a plug-in i think

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,480
that could be

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,119
another fantastic way to kind of make

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,680
sure that these plugins

00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,160
i mean if there's a monetization

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,079
possibility for the plug-in

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,079
developer they're more likely to spend

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,640
more time developing that plug-in right

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,400
so and that means a better plug-in and a

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,200
better developer experience for everyone

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,160
so

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,359
i um i think the we'll see what happens

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,200
in the future but this is

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,800
i think it's an interesting uh

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,079
interesting space

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,800
you can almost look at it we have talked

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,839
about it like what is an app store

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,000
for the develop for developer tools

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:03,920
basically

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,680
maybe backstage you know in some future

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,440
could become that marketplace or that

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,000
app store essentially

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,560
even though app stores have a tough time

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,240
right now

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,079
in terms of political aspects but

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,240
still still the concept is interesting i

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,240
think

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,520
thank you

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,320
i think there might also be an

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,400
interesting avenue for you know

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,119
companies that are selling

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,400
developer tools let's say a company like

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,560
snick who's doing like you know

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,160
scanning security scanning that's a

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,440
service that you buy and integrate in

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,400
your environment

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,200
and if there's a plug-in or already for

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,839
that

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,599
like it it just shortens the integration

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:52,560
time a customer that's a

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,000
person a team that already has backstage

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,040
they should probably be able to like you

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,200
know

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,720
install that plug-in and get started

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,880
with that developer tool

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,800
more easily than than if you would have

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,839
to have you know go in and sell it as

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,720
like a standalone

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,480
service so i think there's a lot of

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:15,599
interesting possibilities

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,599
absolutely hi cory hi

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,200
did you have a question no i'm just

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,880
signing in for my

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,240
session sorry

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,720
sorry i'm just trying to get my screen

00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,720
going here

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,560
sorry i said i've signed in for my

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,480
session i was told to sign

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,599
in 15 minutes early for our session i'm

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,599
just a couple minutes early

00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,760
so if there are no more questions i

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,200
would love to just encourage everyone to

00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,319
i mean if this sounds interesting

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,359
uh reach out go to backstage io

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,319
or we have a discord open channel where

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,560
you can go and

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,720
