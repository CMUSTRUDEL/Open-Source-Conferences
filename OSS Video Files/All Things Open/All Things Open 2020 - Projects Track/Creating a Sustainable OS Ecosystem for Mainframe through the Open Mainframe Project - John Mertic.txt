Publication date: 2020-12-14
Playlist: All Things Open 2020 - Projects Track
Description: 
	Presented by: John Mertic, Linux Foundation
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Projects Track

Abstract: The Open Mainframe Project was established in 2015 with the aim of pulling the various efforts of ensuring mainframe is a first class citizen for open source into a unified focus. Since that time there has been an uptick in not only new open source projects on mainframe, but also broad open source project supporting mainframe.

In this talk, Open Mainframe Project Director John Mertic will talk about the impacts of mentorships, supporting open source projects, focus on creating a more diverse and inclusive mainframe community, and tooling created to grow and sustain the open source projects on mainframe.

thank you so much

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,679
and thank you all for coming to uh this

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,519
talk here

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,719
um creating a sustainable open source

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,280
ecosystem for

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,080
mainframe through the open mainframe

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,320
project

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,720
and you know when i talk with people

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,600
about open source and mainframe

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,080
they often sort of wonder of how these

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,160
things

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,760
actually come together um some people

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,279
even you know first maybe you have to

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
start explaining what a mainframe is to

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,320
people

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
but more when i just kind of bring both

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,079
these topics together people really

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,960
aren't sure of how they even connect

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,680
and where they would intercept and and

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,360
what have you

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,000
and what's interesting is

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,520
mainframes open sources roots actually

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,800
start with mainframe

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,039
if we go back to 1955 there is

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,480
a new computer that ibm had put out and

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,760
this is sort of a predecessor computer

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,360
to what we consider sort of the modern

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,399
mainframe architecture

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,960
called the ibm 7 model 704 and

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,960
a user group got together in the los

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,000
angeles area

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,760
to kind of talk about this machine

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,479
and kind of you know go back between

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,680
ideas of how to use it how to share some

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,560
of the code and

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,960
programs that one would program on this

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,479
this

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,720
built up over time and what this route

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,400
here was is this first meeting

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,560
was the first meeting of an organization

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,360
called share which still exists to this

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,759
day

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,040
um but it really is if you're talking

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,640
open source and you're really wanting to

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,479
go to the roots of the open source

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,920
movement this is where you start back in

00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,840
1955 with this group of mainframe

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
operators

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,960
collaborating on source code um

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,640
they didn't have the internet available

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,280
they probably didn't have the same

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,840
um you know means available but you know

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
they

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
different medium of how they would use

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,200
this is where it all started this is

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,759
really where the root of open source

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
actually comes from it's all thanks to

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,640
the mainframe and that's a common theme

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,159
you hear sometimes if you talk with

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,320
people in the mainframe world

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,600
you know you bring up a technology topic

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,360
of the day and they say oh geez we did

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,719
it in a mainframe decades ago well

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,399
so it turns out open source is one of

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,920
those as well

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,760
and that tradition continues through to

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,120
today and

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,319
of the ibm z15 which is the latest um

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,520
you know mainframe that was introduced

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,360
last year the heritage

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,080
of those early models continues on

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
and all of the design principles that

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,599
came in that model

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
ibm 704 you know through the early

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,640
system 360s

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,040
um up to the z machines of today

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,680
it all it all roots itself back into

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,080
here

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,440
um and if you just look at this machine

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
here just from the

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,480
sheer specs of it it kind of blows you

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
away

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,519
but what's really important to think

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,000
about here is

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,000
how this system has been designed it has

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,840
been designed along the principles of

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
security availability performance and

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,840
scalability

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,640
um and organizations that turn to this

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,400
platform

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,200
they need all of those turned up to an

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,560
11 and that's why they'd end up choosing

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,959
mainframe

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,239
but let's shoot back to open source here

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,120
because that's what we're talking about

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,640
and

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,280
you know this early collaboration that

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,640
we saw from share in the 1950s

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,400
it continued on through decades in 1975

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,120
a project was founded called cbt tape

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,640
cbt stands for connecticut bacon trust

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
which is a bank that has been defunct

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,519
for many decades

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,560
but one of the early mainframers

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,480
there um he pulled together

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,480
all of this public domain and all of

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,799
these utilities and things that have

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,720
been

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,640
worked on in these various share user

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,239
groups and put it together as a

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,200
canonical tape

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,000
and distributed it um you can actually

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
still today

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,280
uh send him an email or send him a

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,720
letter um and a little bit of money and

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,840
he'll send you

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,879
all the cbt paid project on tape itself

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,560
this is actually really one of the

00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,519
oldest open source project it actually

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
predates

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,040
not only open source but even the free

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,040
software movement um

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,400
and but it was the continuing build of

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
this collaboration that we've seen in

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,439
the mainframe space

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,120
1999 uh linux which has already been a

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,680
thing for many years at that point was

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,239
pointed

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
ported to the s390x platform and we saw

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,600
community efforts

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
from marist universities we saw work in

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,840
some of the ibm germany labs

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
another a bunch of other enthusiasts in

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,680
the space

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
also were working and pulled together to

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,520
bring

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,960
linux to this platform um known by its

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,080
architectural

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,840
uh indication of s390x and

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,840
from there we saw linux distribution

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,440
supporting it with suse as one of the

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,479
initial ones with red hat and others

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,880
following

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,919
the growth of customers and that

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,639
critical mass

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,919
that that is happening um you know with

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,280
all sorts of different open source

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,440
projects coming to the mainframe

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
so the question that we often sort of

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,880
get asked when we when we talk about

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,120
sort of open source in this line

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,320
is um you know open source isn't you

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,800
know slowing down anytime

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
soon and the growth continues um and

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,440
this is something we're just broadly

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,840
seeing all over

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,039
and what ends up being really

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,240
interesting

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,160
is where you know where we're seeing

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,479
open source code being used

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,560
um and if we talk about you know a

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,840
platform such as mainframe which

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,080
you know many believe is a very

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,680
proprietary platform the reality

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,120
is is a lot of the code that's being

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,080
brought together

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,520
is dependent upon open source and we

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,520
actually see the same pattern just

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,160
across the industry as well

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,400
where there's you know a framework

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
underneath which is open source powered

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,680
there's libraries that are solving some

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,120
of the common problems that are powered

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,560
by open source

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,759
and really there's that custom code in

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
the middle that isn't so we're almost

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,039
saying 90

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,479
of that code is actually open source so

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,039
that means there's a lot of open source

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,639
out there

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,600
and the question is is which projects

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,120
matter and the real answer is all

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,400
projects matter

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,919
but um the really the ones that you know

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,960
we try to focus on

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,240
are the ones that have a huge impact

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,039
on our society but more importantly they

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,479
have

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,319
um large sustainable ecosystems and

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,160
you know this is sort of the model that

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,840
we look to help drive here

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,240
um not only the open mainframe project

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,479
but the linux foundation

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,520
you know projects are where we put our

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,240
focus on

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,560
the success of those projects find their

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,400
way

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,000
into products or internal usage that

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,160
means there is savings for an

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,600
organization on r d cost or greater

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,680
profits from taking the

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,120
product to market all of that drives

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,319
back into the project

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,080
and the circle continues so

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,360
what we're focused on here is a

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,440
sustainable ecosystem

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
and sustainability when we talk about it

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,479
it's about longevity

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,319
sustainability uh the term itself even

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,840
comes from sustain and ability and if

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,840
you put those together it's a property

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
of systems to remain diverse and

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,880
productive

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,560
indefinitely and if we think about the

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,120
mainframe and architecture that has been

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,880
around for decades and decades

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,960
sustainability is the name of the game

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,840
and that is

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,759
really where this community is continue

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,759
has focused and is continuing to focus

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,880
going forward

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,120
now if we look at ecosystems around

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,880
uh the mainframe you know and this is

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,560
kind of a very common thing we often see

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,599
in a lot of places here

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,400
is that these ecosystems that form have

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,720
challenges

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,520
and if we look at sort of the path in

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,240
which we've

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,759
went through from mainframe the early

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,080
days of share

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
to the cbt tape to linux coming to the

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,080
platform

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,479
there's a lot of community activity

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,000
happening but at some point

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,240
there's a glass ceiling that gets hit um

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,080
some of it's caused by you know just

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,039
this fragmentation that happens in the

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,199
market from just

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,360
all sorts of you know different efforts

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,160
that are competitive overlapping

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,080
um with one another um the governance of

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,160
how one gets involved in a project can

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,560
be a little bit complicated with

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,680
um you know favoring of governance um

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,720
towards the people who created the

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,879
project

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,000
um and it's sort of being very dominated

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,800
that way

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,080
a lack of an ecosystem being built um

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,400
and even just sort of

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,720
you know kind of basic things but really

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,160
important of you know owning of assets

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,479
and um you know who's sort of managing

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,160
the essential health of the projects

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
this is really what led to the open

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,479
mainframe project there was already a

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
very

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,360
vibrant open source community here but

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,399
it got to that point where bringing this

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,880
into a vendor-neutral entity all of it

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,680
was needed to get to that next set of

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,640
innovation

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,519
and innovation certainly have been the

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,279
project

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,279
uh we just had our the project's had its

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,600
fifth birthday this year

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,480
launched in 2015 it opened uh at

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,120
linuxcon

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
seattle um and was seated with the first

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,959
project of ade

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,800
um anomaly detection engine for linux

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,080
logs still a great project here for

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,640
today

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,000
and this project continued to grow and

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,680
you know i think there's a couple really

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,760
great milestones that we've seen along

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,080
the way of this innovation acceleration

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,760
one of just the mentorship program

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,800
forming in 2016

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,360
which has brought lots of new

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,880
open source to the platform alpine linux

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,360
was ported by one of our first

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,399
mentees but we've also seen big

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,920
contributions to openstack cloud foundry

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,160
kubernetes hyperledger and a number of

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,279
other open source projects

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,959
it brought in the focus out of really

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,399
looking into the zos community and

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,480
bringing it

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,440
into the fold and helping drive open

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,839
source there

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,360
with the launch of zoe two years ago

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,000
which has been really the first ever

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,640
open source

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,640
project launched on the zos platform and

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,120
seen some huge growth

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,920
ever since but it's also brought in this

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,920
tidal wave of new projects 2019

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,600
we launched five new projects so far in

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,880
2020 we've lost

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,800
lodge six um with several more um

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,920
in the wings and i think what we're

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,839
starting to see here

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,240
is more and more folks in the mainframe

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,200
world are embracing this concept

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,839
of vendor-neutral collaboration and

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,480
bringing

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,040
these great efforts uh to the open

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,640
mainframe project

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,720
so why are we here what's the mission of

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,640
this project well it's very simple

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,240
we want to build community and adoption

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,160
of open source in the mainframe

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,279
and there's three ways that this project

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,040
does that

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,399
one is by eliminating the barriers to

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,920
open source adoption

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,640
on the mainframe by providing access to

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,839
hardware

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,200
better education and helping connect

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,200
talent to one another

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,680
demonstrating the value of the mainframe

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,680
on technical and business levels

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,959
and really what the most important thing

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,760
that any

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,440
foundation can do is strengthening those

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,959
collaboration points

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,800
and we're going to talk a lot about

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,399
those collaboration points as we

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,079
sort of move through the slides today

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,760
here you know here's just as we kind of

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,160
dig more into those barriers and things

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,200
that

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,680
are happening there around career growth

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,160
showcasing the modern application

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,640
workflows and driving global initiatives

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,399
for the platform um you know being able

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,120
to champion and showcase what's

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
happening

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,600
um with the mainframe through business

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,600
case studies and blog posts and you know

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,160
other media out there

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,600
and the collaboration point of bringing

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,320
projects together

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,920
providing tools and infrastructure and

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,360
having a mentorship program to help

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,079
bring new folks into

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,839
the fold here and what we have created

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,480
here is this amazing space

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,600
for open source collaboration on the

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,880
mainframe here with

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,640
15 projects currently hosted by the

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,839
foundation and you can learn more

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,000
it open mainframeproject.org projects on

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,600
that

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,040
but also i would encourage you to take a

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,279
look at the open mainframe

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,079
landscape and as it turns out there's a

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,720
much even

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,320
broader view of what's going on in the

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,680
open source on mainframe world and you

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,480
can check out here

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,880
l.openmainframeproject.org where you can

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,120
see

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,040
what the rest of the open source

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,680
projects on mainframe look like

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,000
um including um offerings that are

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,240
happening from the zoe conformance world

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,760
um along with the linux distributions

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,639
and other projects and the member

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,519
companies that are behind this

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,120
so i'm going to kind of deep dive into a

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,320
few of these projects here

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,200
of what's going on but more of just sort

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,959
of looking

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,399
at um the big picture of how all these

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,680
projects are connecting together and

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:45,120
driving new innovation

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,720
so we mentioned zoe and

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,079
zoe's been a real revolutionary project

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,320
for the zos community the big challenge

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,839
that that community has had for many

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,160
many many years

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,040
is it's just a different operating

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,560
system

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,600
um than what norm what what the typical

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,000
uh you know student or application

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,800
developer or devops person

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,320
is familiar with it's just different um

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,440
it's not good better otherwise it's just

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,040
very different

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,959
and organizations suffer this way

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,000
because it ends up having just a huge

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,079
talent gap

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,320
of being able to support you know their

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,120
zos infrastructure versus the rest

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,399
of the infrastructure you know devops

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,560
tools have been really good about

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,240
bridging across linux and

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,480
windows and mac os and different cloud

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,480
environments but to the zos world that

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,959
really hadn't got there yet at least the

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,880
the common tools that you see in

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,600
operations environments today

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,720
so the idea with zoe is what if we

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,240
modernize

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,399
the integration um with those services

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,199
so as opposed to working through

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,079
um what folks might refer to as a green

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,639
screen

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,320
or a 3270 terminal which is probably the

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
more formal name to it

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,199
what if we provide rest apis what if

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,040
there was a command line interface

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,800
what if there was a way to build a web

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,160
app um using

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,800
you know modern javascript components uh

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
help how can we modify modernize that

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,279
integration with z os

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,639
based applications and services and then

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,360
the second and this sort of

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,279
leads into it of you know this just

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,040
being different cos being different

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,199
there's the talent gap um and how can

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,000
enabling and bringing these modern tools

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,680
and integration strategies

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,199
enable modern development stacks but

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,440
use that as a tool that bridges that

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,720
talent gap so these are the challenges

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,240
that came

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,880
and zoe launched 2018 um as really the

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,079
first step

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,639
towards that uh it was a huge project in

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,839
2019 they they got to their 1.0 release

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,199
in very early

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,040
2019 which is a huge actual feat

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
for the amount of code that came between

00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
all three of the initial contributing

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,040
organizations of

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,880
of broadcom ibm and rocket software

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,320
and at the same time they launched a

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,240
conformance program

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
and we're seeing these more and more in

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,480
open source

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,959
and it's a great way for the community

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,800
to help add definition to what the

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,000
downstream ecosystem

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,839
looks like and a black clarity to say

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,760
that you're taking this project

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,959
and you're using it in a conformant way

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
you're using in a way

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,320
that it's designed from how the

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,079
community's envisionment

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
of having this large ecosystem of

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,959
applications and tooling that can

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,759
integrate and leverage this as a

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,360
platform

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,199
a conformance program sets those

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,160
boundaries there and then gives

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,000
marks for organizations to be able to

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,360
talk to that

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,120
and we you know with such a

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,399
a large project and a lot of moving

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,079
pieces um

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,920
you know we spent tremendous time

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,079
investing in collaboration tooling

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,639
ecosystem development infrastructure

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,639
you know getting zoe um you know at

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,639
various devops events but also

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,399
you know very widely recognized in the

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,000
open source world as well this is a

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,240
whole new world to z os

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,839
of you know talking about z os at an

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,120
open source conference such as all

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,399
things open

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,880
isn't something that probably would have

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,240
happened before 2018 but now it is

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,600
happening

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,759
and there's huge investments that have

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,519
happened in that area

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:24,959
what does that meant 2020 all time

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,839
over 20 000 commits and 200 different

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,279
committers

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,199
all time to the project um a real real

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,079
fascinating number and a real

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,079
huge testament to the amount of effort

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,240
and innovation that is being pushed into

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,079
this project

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,480
zoe as a project is actually getting a

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,880
lot of mind share in the devops world

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,800
it's you continuously been at the top of

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,040
devops dozens lists and other

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,720
um you know industry analyst list as

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,320
well and

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,399
we're seeing more and more times where

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,320
zoe is just being introduced into that

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,920
conversation as a way to

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,160
unify an organization's i.t environment

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,600
and that downstream ecosystem that we

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,280
created back in

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,760
2019 with the launch of the conformance

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,120
program to date and i think this number

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,480
is actually probably low i think we're

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,199
closer to 30 plus

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,679
zoe conformant offerings on the market

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,000
um

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,000
and we've seen them from um to date five

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,439
different organizations pushing those so

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,120
we're already seeing

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,199
growth out of the initial contributing

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,919
organizations but we're seeing

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,039
larger business partners and other

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,039
software vendors

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,400
saying that hey we want to we see this

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,640
ecosystem is valuable

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,080
and we're building upon this as we take

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,480
zoe to market so

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,280
a fascinating story there that we're

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,360
seeing um

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,160
unfold and certainly in 2021 we're going

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,679
to see a lot more to come here

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,360
so let's switch over to another project

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,720
uh phelon

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,400
which is you know if you if you sat in

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,960
elizabeth joseph's session earlier today

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,720
i did

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,880
catch a good portion of it she talked

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,440
about um zvm

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,120
as sort of a hypervisor before

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,559
most of the hypervisors that we know

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,280
today um

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,400
and and actually a very very good one

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,880
for the amount of technology and

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,480
innovation that has been put into it

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,120
this is the standard within mainframe

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,640
shops in

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,919
evm the challenges

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,960
were organizations have been using cloud

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,480
stack technologies such as openstack

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,520
or kubernetes or others

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,200
as sort of that technology for you know

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,760
effectively maintaining an internal

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,120
cloud environment um and zvm didn't have

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,960
the greatest way to connect with that

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,559
there you know there had been

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,840
some tooling that's been put in place

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,200
but it really wasn't um you know very

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,080
scalable um

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,520
and there was a work on sort of redoing

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,240
um a lot of this project

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,799
and the challenge was it was very much

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,520
um

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,080
ibm was driving it and you know not that

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
we do not

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,760
definitely the community does not

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,360
appreciate uh contributions from ibm but

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,120
you know that becomes very unsustainable

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
you become one vendor that is holding up

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
an

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,080
entire ecosystem that is looking to

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,080
really drive forward um and there was

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,600
definitely business partners in the area

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
that were also looking at this like you

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,679
know

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,760
we see this is a very promising

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,039
technology but

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,760
we need to help bring this into a

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:21,039
vendor-neutral entity to really drive

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,280
and get that larger adoption

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,960
2019 open mainframe project we brought

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,320
feylong in

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,520
and what was really interesting as they

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,440
formed their initial

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,720
tsc which stands for technical steering

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,320
committee

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,720
they didn't have somebody from ibm that

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,200
led it they had co-chairs from suse

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,880
and velocity software which was very

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,280
interesting and it was a very

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,640
you know tip of the hat um to knowing

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,600
that you were

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,160
that project is really driving towards

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
getting

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,240
a diverse set of organizations involved

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,600
and with that

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,600
they've been working on building an open

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,640
cicd infrastructure and development

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,039
environment

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,080
um so this code can continue to be built

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,280
out

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,640
we're around 2020 we're seeing even more

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,720
organizations

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,080
start to take part um leverage the

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,080
technology and work to push

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,240
um things upstream um and

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,280
it's become sort of this interesting hub

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,799
of innovation

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,559
and we're even seeing some of these

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,640
vendors that might have

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,840
went off and built their own solutions

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,760
in this space

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,200
uh they're actually starting to rebase

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,360
and they're starting to look at feylong

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,320
um as the base of work so it's really

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,320
really fascinating

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,480
so cobalt um cobalt's been in the news

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,000
quite a bit um

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,120
and uh you might recall from uh back in

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,760
april um there were some state governors

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,919
that uh got on the air and and said hey

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,039
we don't have cobalt talent to

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,400
maintain some of the infrastructure that

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,960
is being

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,640
uh very over stressed due to the coven

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,760
19 pandemic

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,280
um and the the thought of the time was

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,280
oh geez there's all these

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,559
tools being written out there there's

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,000
all this cobalt code

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,480
out there but there's nobody to maintain

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,880
it so

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,120
we got together um you know we pulled

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,120
together as a community here and we had

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,039
you know ibm and several other vendors

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,400
really you know come to the forefront

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,480
here and say you know let's try to do

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,520
something as a community here

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,039
to um to really tackle this let's not

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,760
take this as a term of offense that

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,200
cobalt

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,480
there's something wrong with cobalt but

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,799
you know let's come together a community

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,320
because these organizations need it

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:35,440
um and furthermore it wasn't just

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,720
important to have a flash in the pan but

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,120
was really important

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,000
is how do we create cobalt

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,360
sustainability how do we make sure

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,039
that the next time that this comes up

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,559
that they're still not the same problem

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,600
if nobody knows where to find a cobalt

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,320
programmer

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,799
right it changes sort of that that whole

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,039
game

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,039
quite a bit and so we're not having all

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,039
these skills in isolation so

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,200
can we enable that next generation can

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,240
we get a new set of people

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,000
um cobalt skills so they can um be ready

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,840
to jump in here

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,840
so we innovated and we innovated very

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,760
quickly um you know within the fact

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,120
within this hitting the news to the time

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,400
we had an announcement

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,400
out there was about a week just to give

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,320
a really good sense of context and

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,120
there's a couple ways that we focused on

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,720
here

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,520
one is we launched a cobalt programming

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,799
course

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,720
um as a pro open source project um which

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,840
was proposed by ibm and number other

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,520
organizations in april 2020 and

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,039
was really really interesting about this

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,919
project is

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,760
um it was accepted by the technical

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,520
advisory council and sort of soft

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,280
launched the code hadn't got there but

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,960
started to make its way onto hacker news

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,400
and things like that

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,960
as we were getting up the github

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,880
repository to put the code in

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,039
we didn't even have all the code up and

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,520
we were already starting to get

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,559
you know hundreds of stars on github

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,960
from it and people

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,559
already beginning to fork it um and we

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
haven't even announced where the code is

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,960
gonna be

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,840
like that's how early on and how much

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,320
excitement was out there

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,000
um and uh to date you know we've had you

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,679
know over 1700

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,080
people star this on github they're

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,840
watching this with over 300 forks

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,520
um and this is in a short amount of time

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,280
i mean this is you know

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,880
literally since april so this is just a

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,880
few months

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,159
and a growing base of contributors and

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,000
just tons of people

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,440
that are actually using this coursework

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,120
and they're building and they're

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,640
going through it and they're learning

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,400
cobol

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,000
and we've even seen more innovation

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,159
happening on that course work to

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,440
support different ides and you know

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,919
different technologies

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,600
um so it's been a really really amazing

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,120
um feat there

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,760
the second thing that we thought of is

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,200
you know our hunch was his talent was

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,880
very much out there

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,640
so how can we connect the talent to the

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,240
need and

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,080
what we provisioned out there were

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,039
collaboration forums and technical

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,440
forums

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,000
around cobol and particularly one we

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,039
called calling all cobol programmers we

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,159
said look if you're

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,640
if you're cobalt talent and you're

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,520
available um for hire even volunteer

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,480
work

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,039
put your name here um we had almost a

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,600
thousand

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,400
individuals sign up for that within a

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,640
week

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,679
um and to date we've had over 1700

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,200
individuals

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,760
make themselves available um either for

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,000
hire

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,919
or for volunteer work and these aren't

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,960
people towards the end of their careers

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,559
um these are um people

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,159
mid-career beginning career they're

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,240
people from different nationalities

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,799
different genders different races

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,120
different backgrounds different ages um

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,559
it's a really really diverse group

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,640
and i think it opened a lot of people's

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,840
eyes of what was going on the cobalt

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,440
world

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,960
and also since then we've also launched

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,400
a cobalt working group

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,240
which has brought together people from

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,919
academia but also different vendors in

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,200
the space as they're looking towards the

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,960
future of cobol

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,600
and how we can maintain how this

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,320
community can maintain sustainability

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,600
because this is going to be a

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,559
cornerstone you know of our technology

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,360
life cycle

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,360
for a long time

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,880
and we talked about this very much

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,880
earlier here the mentorship program

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,159
and you know i won't i won't believe it

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,200
too much here but

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,320
um i think we've seen a huge interest of

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,360
students

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,799
wanting to get involved in mainframe and

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,320
you know one of the numbers that i don't

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,120
throw in this slide and i probably

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,320
should

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,840
is that each year we have had you know

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,120
somewhere between

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,240
a 40 to 60 percent growth in applicants

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,000
for this program there is tons of

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,600
interest of students wanting to get

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,559
involved in mainframe and this

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,080
mentorship

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,840
has been a great way to get that going

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,440
um and what's actually really

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,520
interesting is not only is the work very

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,440
meaningful i mean it's making

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,159
upstream contributions to many many

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,080
large open source projects

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,760
but it's also went back into

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,279
universities where we have virginia

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,039
commonwealth university and western

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,159
university of ontario

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,760
which has uh used this program in their

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,760
class work

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,960
so they're you know training and working

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,320
and getting students familiar with the

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,400
mainframe there

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,080
and the back end of this is these

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,760
mentees that are coming in this program

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,520
they're staying in the mainframe world

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,919
um and they're employed by

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,919
you know organizations like ibm suse um

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,520
adp but you know also a ton more

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,240
business partners out there so it's

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,279
really really been a fantastic story so

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,520
i mean i think the

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,120
the genesis of this here is you know

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,760
we're seeing innovation

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,799
thrive and you know we as an

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,000
organization

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:43,279
um we provide the infrastructure um

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,440
we as a staff have great guidelines and

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,400
great expertise of how you grow open

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,279
source

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,520
um and you know we let this natural

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,039
collaboration happen and and we're here

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,279
to provide that space and we've just

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,400
seen it kind of been time and time again

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,880
and you can learn a little bit more

00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,440
about um the processes of how projects

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,360
come in

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:06,080
um at the web at the link below there

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,279
so it's not just supporting mainframe

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,760
centric

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,640
projects but we're also looking at

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,919
beyond

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,600
um that just hosting projects here

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,279
one of the big things and and this is

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,760
actually something um

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,520
that has been going on you know for over

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,960
two decades now

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,640
for some of you might remember an

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,960
organization called the uh open source

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,399
development labs osdl

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,240
it's a predecessor organization of the

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,679
linux foundation but it had an early

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,159
partnership

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,919
with mayor's college of providing

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,360
infrastructure for these open source

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,399
projects that wanted to support

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,080
mainframe

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,679
well that's carried through today here

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,120
and we actually have a much more formal

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,640
program

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,640
that is wrapping it as a part of our

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,120
empatus project

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,279
where we help provide projects broad

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,880
open source projects infrastructure

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,480
connecting them to developers making the

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,799
market aware of them

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,240
um you know so these projects can

00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,760
support the mainframe

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
and they can support it as a first-class

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,760
citizen and you know just some of the

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,720
projects below are just a few examples

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,000
of ones

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,480
that we've worked with over the last

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,120
several years but that's just really

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,720
it's really a great way that the open

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,480
mainframe project is able to help give

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,080
back to these communities it's not

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,520
just that they dump code on and say hey

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,240
support mainframe this is what you have

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,880
to do

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,760
but they look to make positive impacts

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,960
upstream

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,679
with all of their contributions even

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,440
as i've i've talked with linux kernel

00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,039
maintainers they've even said that

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,320
the contributions that they get from the

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,960
mainframe community are some of the

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,200
strong the

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,720
the best contributions from a technical

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,679
quality standpoint

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,440
um that they see and i think this is a

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,080
fine testament to the great

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,760
level of technical skill and discipline

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,960
that we see

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,960
you know out of this community

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,320
another huge piece that we really want

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,200
to focus on is letting people know who a

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,120
real mainframer

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,480
is and i know that's sort of a funny

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,440
thing to say

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,440
um you know off the cuff like that but

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,080
you know so often people have thought

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,520
um mainframer means somebody their end

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,559
of their career

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:13,039
um perhaps um you know

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:15,440
uh you know a male perhaps white

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,279
that's not really the case at all we

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,760
started this podcast series a few years

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,840
ago and with the idea that

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,880
let's highlight who mainframers are

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,399
and let's do it from a very diverse base

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,760
you know so people knew in their career

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,600
or older in their career people from

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,679
different backgrounds races genders

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,679
ethnicities locales

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,919
um you know different roles within the

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,159
mainframe both go to developer but maybe

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,520
also in the leadership roles as well

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,440
and the big thing that we really want to

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,840
dig into is why do people decide to

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,120
have a career in mainframe like why why

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,840
did they do it

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,520
what draws them to it why do they why do

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,960
they continue to have a career here and

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,320
where do they see it coming and what

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,799
advice would they give

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,480
to others coming into this this is

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,480
recorded as a podcast it's on your

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,760
favorite podcast app whether that's

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,640
itunes

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,679
spotify stitcher you name it it's on

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,279
there

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,880
and you can also find the recordings on

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,240
our website in the transcripts as well

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,440
it's a really really great series if

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,200
there's nothing else

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,799
i would encourage you to start there

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,799
and kind of check out that podcast

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,320
series

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,640
and we spend a lot of time just making

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,279
sure there's an open collaborative space

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,640
around mainframe here you know certainly

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,080
we have the community forums which we've

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,039
spoke to as before which sees a lot of

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,440
vibrancy

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,039
we have a slack channel where all of our

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,559
projects communicate and collaborate

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,320
with one another

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,240
and we also have just launched um our

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,840
annual event open mainframe summit we

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,799
just did it last month it was a huge

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,480
success

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,559
we really brought together the open

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,760
source on mainframe community

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,399
um for the first time really ever um

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,679
and we saw great feedback some great

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,000
collaboration

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,760
um and a lot of new networking and

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,720
relationships started from that point

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,559
there

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,200
and this is a real focal point for us as

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,200
a foundation

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,679
so by the numbers you know we're five

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,000
years oops we're five years into this

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,039
and with almost 40 or almost 40

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,600
organizations

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,880
supporting the 15 hosted projects in

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,240
wordikin groups

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,440
the outcomes have been over 40 mentees

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,720
over well over 100 students and 200

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,840
280 plus probably 300 plus now

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,039
project contributors um driving forward

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,000
this ecosystem

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,799
um it's really been an amazing and it's

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,320
all thanks

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,080
um to not only the people in the

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,200
community but also the organizations and

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,000
logos that you see

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,360
here that believe in the work that is

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,440
happening in the open mainframe project

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,840
and focus on that that continued growth

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,960
and drive

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
you might be asking yourself how do you

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,519
get involved well there's a lot of

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,720
different ways

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,919
um it's a very open participation and

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,880
you know certainly getting involved in

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,240
the community discussion and

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,240
collaboration

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,080
both virtually as we will likely be

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,320
doing for quite some time um

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,840
but also at events when those come back

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,000
together

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,279
definitely engage and find us we always

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,720
have

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,159
we're always at all the open mainframe

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,840
summits and we try to get a great events

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,320
like all things open as well

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,880
um you know to really show support but

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,600
also

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,880
um network with everybody out there um

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,600
15 projects

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,799
um participate or if you have a project

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,279
that you think would fit really well

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,760
here

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,600
um come bring it here the technical

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,960
advisory council accepts new projects

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,200
all the time

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,880
and if you're an organization that sees

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,480
mainframe as an important part of your

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,440
business

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,880
consider corporate sponsorship and it

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,519
showcases stewardship

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,159
and it really helps make this community

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,760
move forward

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,279
so if you want to learn more about open

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,480
mainframe projects a lot of different

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,720
ways here

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,960
first head to the website

00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,880
www.openmainframeproject.org

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,039
you can find our newsletter i would

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,600
encourage you to sign up for it

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,799
we usually get at least some note about

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,000
every month

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,360
talking about some of the great things

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,200
that are happening in our community and

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,640
ways to get involved

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,360
so certainly use that as a first

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,880
starting point two

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,240
discover our projects we just talked

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,480
about that again i'll harp on it again

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,880
they're all here

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,600
openmainframeproject.org

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,000
projects they are all open transparent

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,360
they

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,679
anybody in the community can get

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,960
involved with them and just learn more

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,519
so by all means jump right in there um

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,960
and uh you know see what's interesting

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,480
and we also talked about

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,480
um you know getting involved as an

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,600
organization and if that is something of

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,080
interest

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,159
you know you can learn more um the about

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,840
join page you can email membership at

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,559
and you can talk to me and we can do it

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,039
through all the things online as well

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,880
so with that i want to thank everyone

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,240
for coming um i know this is the end of

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,080
the day here so this is

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,840
the last thing that kind of is between

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,559
uh you and

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,320
uh i would say normally if we were in an

00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,519
in-person conference this is between you

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,559
and the exhibit hall

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,559
um um social but maybe this is between

00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,519
you and dinner um or you and something

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,039
else so

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,359
um i want to thank you for sticking with

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,560
us here and uh definitely

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,480
come check us out and uh happy to

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,480
answer any questions although i don't

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,240
really see any in the q a here so i

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,919
think i must have answered

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,480
just about everybody's question which is

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,480
a good sign

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:31,599
i have a question go for it

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,280
this actually um interested me a lot and

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,000
the reason is because

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,639
i've i've heard a lot about you know

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,839
government

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,280
having issues and and some

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,040
universities having uh code that they

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,079
have to

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,320
um that they're having

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,240
to port or they might want support or

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,200
probably not just maintaining

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,119
so i was wondering how does the open

00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,960
source part of this or does it

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,560
relate to government and

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,119
larger institutions who just have

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,359
mainframes and have not gotten enough of

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,720
them

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,800
you know it's a great it's a great

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,280
question um

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,160
and it's really kind of interesting

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,680
because you know

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,680
a lot of sort of i think the underlying

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,520
we alluded to is you know that so much

00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,800
this technology has been out there and

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,440
just sort of humming along in the

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,720
background and doing its job which

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,359
you know if you say that's that's that's

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,480
a good hallmark of any technology

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,000
is it just does its job and

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,280
it doesn't create a lot of fuss it

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,720
doesn't create a lot of attention it

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,119
just does it

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,480
um so i think as we're sort of like

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,640
looking at the intersection with open

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,599
source i think what what is happening in

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,160
organizations

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,200
is there's just so many different ways

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,599
that applications

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,040
and data are being managed and being

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,119
delivered

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,960
you know not just cloud but we're seeing

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,119
edge computing

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,960
we're seeing different sorts of

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,680
infrastructure and hardware being put

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,800
together

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,200
much of this across different locales um

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,560
you know the average organization is is

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,880
seeing you know their data

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,160
um in many many many many many different

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,160
places and

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,079
mainframe just happens to be one of them

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,640
but the real challenge an organization

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,320
runs into is how can it help pull some

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,200
of these data streams together

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,640
um to drive value um for them internally

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,599
and also for their customers

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,440
and what we have seen is open source

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,240
ends up being that glue because this is

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,240
a very

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:33,520
common problem that is across everywhere

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,280
um and uh you know

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,119
that is that i think is we're starting

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,960
to see is sort of the new driver

00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,560
out there you open source and you

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,000
learned a lot about at this conference

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,560
and and many others

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,720
is becoming the glue that pulls together

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,680
an organizational's digital strategy

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,800
their application

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,280
strategy their data strategy um and

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,079
having mainframe now become a citizen in

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,400
there

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,760
all of a sudden makes this architecture

00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,520
not only relevant

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,119
but on the flip side and we talked about

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,079
in the earlier part of

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,880
this architecture having some very

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,320
unique properties here of security

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,839
um and performance and availability and

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,560
safe scalability

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,599
that cannot be done on any other

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,640
platform that are

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,800
can't you can't even do in the cloud um

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,000
if you need applications that can that

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,119
need that

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,839
sort of level um of

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,200
service you can float them right to a

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,320
mainframe and you can manage it just

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,160
like you do for the rest of the

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,720
organization

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,920
so it's really it's really helped an

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,440
organization i mean you know you hear

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,800
things like microservices and i think

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,200
like that's probably one of the greatest

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,720
things

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,240
you know for mainframes out there is

00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,599
because you can flirt the services that

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,960
make sense in a mainframe there you can

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,760
float the ones that make sense on an

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,280
edge

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,880
node to there the full the ones that

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
make sense in the cloud and over there

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,040
so

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,720
there's really just a lot of different

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,800
areas that

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,079
you can push your applications there so

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,920
yeah i think open source is just this

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,280
enabling technology that is just

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,119
pulling everything together and now a

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,839
mainframe is right there

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,040
as a citizen is a part of that hopefully

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,040
i got somewhere close to answering your

00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,280
