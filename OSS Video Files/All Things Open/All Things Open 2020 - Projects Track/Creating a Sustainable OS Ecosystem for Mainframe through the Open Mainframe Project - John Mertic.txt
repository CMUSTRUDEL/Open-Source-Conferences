Abstract: The Open Mainframe Project was established in 2015 with the aim of pulling the various efforts of ensuring mainframe is a first class citizen for open source into a unified focus. Since that time there has been an uptick in not only new open source projects on mainframe, but also broad open source project supporting mainframe.

In this talk, Open Mainframe Project Director John Mertic will talk about the impacts of mentorships, supporting open source projects, focus on creating a more diverse and inclusive mainframe community, and tooling created to grow and sustain the open source projects on mainframe.
