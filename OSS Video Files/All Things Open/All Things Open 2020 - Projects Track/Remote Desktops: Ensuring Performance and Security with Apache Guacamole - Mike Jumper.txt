Abstract: Due to the pandemic, organizations have had to support a fully remote workforce with little time, and many remote desktop deployments were rushed. The first priority was access, with security and performance taking a temporary backseat.

Now, however, itâ€™s time to ensure end-users have a reliable, high-performant experience and that access is secure. Mike Jumper, Apache Guacamole PMC chair and CEO of Glyptodon, will provide a technical guide of best practices to deploy, configure and maintain Apache Guacamole to ensure a safe and snappy remote desktop experience. Topics will include:

- Reverse proxy configuration
- Authentication extensions
- Multi-factor authentication
- Back-end hardware requirements
