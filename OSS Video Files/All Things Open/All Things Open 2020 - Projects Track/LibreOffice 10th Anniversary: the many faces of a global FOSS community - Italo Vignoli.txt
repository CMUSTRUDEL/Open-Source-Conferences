Description: 
	Presented by: Italo Vignoli, The Document Foundation/LibreOffice Project
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Projects Track

Abstract: LibreOffice was announced in 2010 and will celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2020. During these 10 years, the global community has grown from a small group of volunteers - mostly based in Europe - to a large and diverse group of free software advocates active in most countries. The presentation will discuss the challenges faced by the community during its incredible growth over the past 10 years.

LibreOffice was born as a desktop office suite for Windows, macOS and Linux, and is now available in the cloud as a Saas solution. So, the community is focused not only on development and related tasks as QA and UX, but also on other key activities such as end user documentation and marketing. In addition, there is a specific focus on fundraising, as the project is not backed by a company but is completely independent. The historical overview will be based on software releases, adding facts and figures about the project. The objective is to provide a better understanding of the LibreOffice community to people who have followed the evolution from outside, through announcements and events. To complete the talk, an overview of what can happein in the future.

	00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,880
so

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,960
libreoffice was born slightly more than

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,440
10 years ago because it was

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,000
september 28 so it's

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,039
just one month more than almost one

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,119
month more than

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,640
10 years but the

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,559
it's important to remember that

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,239
in the year 2000 sun announced

00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:37,520
openoffice.org

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,239
and then in 2010 the open office the

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,800
door community announced libreoffice

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:47,840
um why i'm remember in those two days

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,280
because uh this is the history of a

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,160
project that uh goes back

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
quite a long time so the first version

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,760
of

00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,039
star writer was released by marco

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,320
berries a german student at the time

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,840
in 1985 and

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,280
become an office suite over time

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:16,479
with people developing it in

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,479
out of hamburg in germany so

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,280
in after the the

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,640
star office the product the german

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,680
product

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,079
first become very popular but then

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,960
had to face the competition of microsoft

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,479
office

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,159
and started to have some issues so

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,200
at the end of last century

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,520
sun approached star division

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:50,000
and decided to buy to acquire

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:53,439
the entire company and is and the assets

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,399
because they

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,079
needed first they needed a software

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,040
capable of running

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,119
on their spark machines so an office

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,399
suite capable of running on

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,679
on some computers as otherwise

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,280
every sun employer to

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,400
have a some work station and a laptop

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,000
with uh with office on it

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,360
so this was the uh

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,480
the trigger but then

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,800
the sun

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,120
realized that it could by donating the

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,400
the source code to the open source

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,040
community

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
it could be possible to create a

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,120
community

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,200
around that software because

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,879
it was feeling an empty space in uh

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,800
in the market so a free office suite

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:56,480
where the community could contribute

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,319
especially in in terms of localizations

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,360
and make it available

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,720
in a high number of languages

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,640
so over time we

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:13,040
uh in in 2009

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,159
and here in this one which is from

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,519
swedish research it's easier to

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:24,159
see the dates in 2009 but it was

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:27,440
finalized in 2010 oracle acquires a sun

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:31,200
and it was clear since day one

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,720
that open office was not

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,000
a strategic software for oracle

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,879
so the open office community that the

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,720
what we can call the leaders of the

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,080
community

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,120
they met behind the scenes and worked

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,040
hard during 2010

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,480
to fork and create an independent

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,280
project

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:03,120
the fork happened on september 28 2010

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,319
we chose the name libreoffice

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,000
for a number of reasons including the

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,080
fact that

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,360
it was one of the few domains available

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,239
in every geography without having to go

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,239
and buy

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,239
expensive names around

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,240
and we started the project what happened

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,840
is that

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,680
in 2011 um

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:38,479
oracle uh we can say

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:41,520
um heavily sponsored by ibm

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,720
donated the open office code to

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,960
apache software foundation to create

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,320
apache open office

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,400
ibm uh didn't like the community to

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,680
control the source code

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,880
so they basically wanted to fight

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,160
libreoffice and they did it for uh

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,479
three years when it was clear that their

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,840
project was not successful they

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:12,240
completely abandoned apache open office

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,240
so apache open office today is

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,199
not develop actively as much as

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,080
libreoffice

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,360
what we did when we when we forked we

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,479
basically

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,400
switched from the umbrella culture

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:32,240
where sun was inspiring protecting and

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,120
in some cases blocking the community

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,440
to a mixing bowl where all the members

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,120
of the community could contribute

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,199
and not only contribute but lead

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:49,120
if based on meritocracy

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,800
this is the text of the announcement

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,240
and as you can see the community of

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,120
volunteers developing

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,039
and promoting openoffice.org sets up an

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,800
independent foundation to drive the

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,800
further growth of the project

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,280
basically what we did we realized that

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,479
the

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,520
innovation at open office

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,720
was at serious risk because there was a

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,080
risk of abandon

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,840
and what happened afterwards confirmed

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,120
our

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,360
our ideas and

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,440
we took control of the code and we

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,319
relaunched the innovation

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,759
we we have developed the project over 10

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,160
years

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,759
libreoffice is now available on

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,039
different platforms

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,199
not always with the libreoffice name but

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,680
always based on the libreoffice

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:46,639
technology which is the

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,960
engine behind all the different products

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,000
this is what happened the six months the

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,880
what happens the

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,800
ten months before and the ten months

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,440
after the fork uh

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,199
the pie on the left is ten months before

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,720
as you can see

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,440
you have uh 66 by the open office

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,280
division and 16

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,400
by sun then there was nobel contributing

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,240
and other companies but the

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,360
uh over uh

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,080
80 percent was done by a single company

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,599
basically by a single company

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,360
after the fork the situation was a lot

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,720
more balanced

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,680
we we managed to

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,919
uh maintain this diversity over over the

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,039
years of course there are

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:44,160
times where the diversity is higher in

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,520
times where the diversity is uh is not

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,800
as

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,680
much as we would like it to be

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,039
but in any case we have been attracting

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,080
new developers

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,840
on a regular basis since uh

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,680
that the day of the fork and

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:07,199
so we basically were able to announce

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,120
libreoffice 3.3 because we used

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:14,160
the same numbering scheme of open office

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:19,520
at fosdem 2011 so it was

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:22,000
late january 2011. and when we announced

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,599
we also announced our roadmap that was

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,599
time-based

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,680
with two major releases every year

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,240
basically synchronize with the linux

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,519
distributions

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,080
because that is our

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,719
one of our reference market this it is

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,200
true that the majority of

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:48,640
our users are on windows but

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,680
we provide libreoffice

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:56,160
to linux distribution as

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:59,519
they are downstream and therefore

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,600
we we prefer to respect

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,360
the schedule of linux distribution

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,880
because that was

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,080
what was more important for us

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,279
in addition we have monthly or

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,120
bi-monthly buckfix releases

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,440
uh for instance tomorrow we will

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,519
announce uh

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:26,959
647 uh and which is uh will be the last

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,959
minor release of the 6-4 family

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,760
so far we we have never missed a single

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,959
major release in a few cases

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,720
we slipped the minor releases few days

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,160
or a couple of weeks

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,160
because of security

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:49,040
issues that we wanted to solve before

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,640
getting to the user so this

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,440
is the announcement of the document

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,160
foundation this is the on page

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,279
the first one is a little bit looks a

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,560
little bit naive

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:03,600
today but

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,560
uh is a very important for us because is

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,839
a german non-profit

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,760
which is protecting

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,839
the spirit of the free office

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:23,120
suite and the free open source

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:27,519
software the founding principles of the

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,560
the foundation

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:34,800
we use a copyleft license we

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:38,480
started with lgpl

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,560
and we added mpl we don't have a

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,160
contributor agreement

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,440
we are based on meritocracy

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,440
our community the the governance is

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,040
expressed by the community so you can

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,880
become a member of the document

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,920
foundation and if you are a member you

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,120
can

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,760
elect and be elected and

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,640
we have we are vendor independent

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,560
because

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:07,440
we have a threshold

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,040
no company can have more than 30 percent

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,160
of the votes

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,240
in any of the two main bodies which are

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,640
the board of directors and the

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,880
membership committee

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,880
of course this vendor independence

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,959
sometimes

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,920
is under discussion because there are

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,160
companies

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,320
that contribute heavily that would like

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,200
to see themselves

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,959
more represented but i think that we

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,560
have to protect our

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,959
principles of course our main asset

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,120
are the developers we we started with

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,959
many developers and we have increased

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,920
them

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,320
actually open office at the time of the

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,040
fork

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,160
was considered to be very difficult uh

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,200
as a source code to navigate

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,440
so that the senior developers did

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,079
they invented the easy access so they

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,079
basically

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:08,240
found a small hacksaw

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:12,160
that put together could

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:16,399
get to a completely new feature

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:21,120
or a code

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:24,480
cleaning or code refactoring

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,480
easy acts are simple and accessible task

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,800
they've allowed many developers to start

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,160
working on the libreoffice code of

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,320
course

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,680
there was a huge mentoring effort by the

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,279
senior developers

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:43,040
here is michael mixer

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,600
a well-known developers it was a novel

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,800
before

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,240
then it was at souze and then and now

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,800
is at collabora productivity

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:58,880
mentoring new uh younger one

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,760
this is the number uh of developers the

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,560
progression of developers up to

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,279
developer

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,760
the december 2012 as you can see

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,639
we had an impressive number coming on

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,839
october 2010

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,440
around 18 new developers this base of

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,720
course on the enthusiasm of the

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,839
announcement

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,959
but then we managed to have new

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,279
developers

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:30,240
basically every month up to today

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,880
we at a certain point we started we we

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,040
stopped counting them because

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,720
it doesn't mean a lot to count them

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,199
after 10 years

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,120
uh what is important is to see that

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,240
there are comments on the

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,000
source code we

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,000
developers also started to

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,800
clean and refactor the code so for

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:57,279
instance

00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:00,839
there was a complete rewrite of the

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,560
d-make build system and

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,760
now uh building a libreoffice is a lot

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,040
easier than it was in the past

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,480
um we added and this uh

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,480
the chart goes up to 6.0

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,120
again uh when you have 30 000 unit tests

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,760
um adding them is important but of

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,160
course it

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,040
shows that we are adding them regularly

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,519
so

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,240
um sometimes we are not updating these

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,920
charts

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,530
just because now i think we have

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,760
demonstrated that we are uh

00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,839
[Music]

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,440
we can be trusted in term of uh

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,839
development

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,519
so we there was a growth or unit

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:51,440
uh there there is a system

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:55,279
for uh to test load crashes

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:59,040
and import and escort crashes

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,160
uh there's there are tested for

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,120
automatic testing here you see

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,120
test on calc

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:13,040
also we translated german comments to

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,920
english as i said before

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,760
openoffice was born in germany and at

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,680
first it was not supposed to become a

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,000
global project

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,880
so developers were commenting the source

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,560
code in

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:30,480
german which is doesn't make it

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,600
uh to come to too user-friendly

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,759
for people that are not speaking german

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,920
and are used to uh

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:46,000
source code commented in english so we

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,560
basically translated everything and

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,639
and these are the commits uh by

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,120
organization during the last two years

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,880
as you see we have collabora volunteers

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,079
quite a large chunk

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,079
red hat cib

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,920
muni tdf there are several people

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
committing there may not be

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,399
full-time developers but they are doing

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,199
quite a lot of activities

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,320
munich also the city of munich and there

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,040
are quite many other companies

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,000
these are the same git commits if you

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,320
look at them

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,720
march 2018 february 2020 of course

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,320
you have summer and christmas uh like

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,560
for everyone

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,560
developers are reducing their activity

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,079
uh in term of quality we use

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,680
automatic uh tools like

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,720
coverity scan and i think that

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,399
in regards with coverity scan

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:54,320
we did something really significant

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,480
because we went down to a defect density

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,320
which is

00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,519
0.00 and something

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,639
as you can see we have on this

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,639
on september 12th 12

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,360
this is at the time more or less at the

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:12,559
time of

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:15,839
7.0.1 or 7.0.2

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,319
the source code 6 million over 6 million

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,160
of lines of code analyze and

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:25,199
one outstanding issue found by

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:29,520
coverity scan of course coverity

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:33,200
is not solving bugs

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,919
but is helping to spot weak points in

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,160
in the source code and just as a

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,880
reference

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,320
libreoffice is at zero as you can as you

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,440
you see

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,760
average proprietary software is at 0.7

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,480
and average free open source software is

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,600
at 0.65

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,600
so these are

00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:01,039
this is a summary of data since 2016.

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
then we use the fuzzing tool uh one of

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,679
the most known

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,280
is google os fuzz but we use

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:12,480
others as well and they help us

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,640
in spotting especially

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,960
security and vulnerability security

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,480
issues and vulnerabilities

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,280
before they can reach the user we

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,679
uh crossing fingers we have a very good

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,799
track record in this term

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,000
so far we have been

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:35,039
able to solve all vulnerabilities

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,600
before they were released to the market

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,280
so

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,760
within the grace period

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,480
when the vulnerability is announced and

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,600
when

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,760
it is is announced internally and then

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,960
is announced to the public

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,720
in general what we have achieved we have

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,919
reduced the footprint

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,480
but what do we if we want to summarize

00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,640
you have

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,480
we have paid down a substantial

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,080
technical debt

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:08,640
open office was a very good product

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:12,799
but for a number of reasons

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,559
was not keeping up with the same pace of

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,039
the market

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,679
so although it was a good product uh it

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,039
had some

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,480
issues and we have been able to solve

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,640
most of these issues for instance we are

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,760
able to write

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,039
microsoft office proprietary office of

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,640
an xml file

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,640
i'm i'm using the proprietary

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,120
term with uh for a reason and we will

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,559
get to this uh

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,320
later on of course we have a very strong

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,520
community

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,799
uh this is the situation of us on ask a

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,559
libreoffice

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,919
we are now considering an evolution to

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,120
this course

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,240
uh to for supporting uh

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,440
the users and these are baczilla issues

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,080
by status

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,320
also march 2018 february 2020

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,919
we provide if you are curious about the

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,440
updated numbers

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,159
you can go to

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,520
dashboard.documentfoundation.org

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,720
and you will find all this data

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,360
public and we are improving

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,600
this data and providing additional data

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,360
because we are still not happy

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,960
how community contributions are

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,200
are calculated

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,039
um these are commit these are community

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,039
contribution by numbers

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,400
according to the dashboard but for

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,240
instance and i will

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,039
mention that later all the

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,200
translators most of the translators are

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,240
not here and we have a very large number

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,480
of

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,520
people active in localization so as you

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,559
can see

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,240
we have around 70 core people

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,679
uh doing 80 percent of the work

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,960
we have around 180 regular ones

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:12,320
doing around 15 percent

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,000
and then we have 700 people more or less

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,600
casual ones

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,400
doing uh five percent uh don't be fooled

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,520
by numbers

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,640
that five percent of casual ones

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,919
can be a security patch which is

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,520
provided on

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:32,720
demand basically because we have

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,520
people that is not

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
actively developing libreoffice but is

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,120
helping us

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,919
in solving uh security issues

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,240
and this is a the geography of the

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,600
libreoffice community

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,120
dark green is where we have members

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,159
like green is where we have the

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,720
community but on we don't have

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,720
members

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,840
it's important as you of course as we

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,400
realize uh

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,880
africa is the area where we are uh less

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,400
represented we are making some efforts

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,720
there

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,440
to attract more people and to get in

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,640
touch with more people unfortunately

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,039
the current situation with the pandemics

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,799
is not helping us

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:26,000
and we we were supposed to be

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,679
i was supposed to be with you face to

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,080
face today

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,320
but of course uh this uh is now

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,120
impossible so i hope

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,320
next year or if it's not next year in

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,880
two years

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,159
to be with you and uh have a beer

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,520
together

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,799
and chat and discuss face to face

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,240
as i was saying we have a huge native

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,240
language community

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,880
with localization teams we have 145

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,000
active languages and 119

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,280
shipping languages libreoffice

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,799
is by far the software available in more

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,080
languages

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:09,280
more than any other

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,640
foss software more than any other

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,720
proprietary software we wanted this to

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,520
be recognized by

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,200
guinness world record but they told us

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,760
that this

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,840
is a niche achievement probably they

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,919
ignored the fact

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,880
that in the world that there is there

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,159
are around 160

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,760
languages and we are the only software

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:39,440
that is able to reach

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,360
most of the people in the world

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,039
and provide to most of the people in the

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,840
world uh

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,200
the software with their with with a user

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,919
interface

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,919
and in many cases a dictionary in their

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,919
native language which is extremely

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,320
important

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,279
these are very quickly these are the

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,400
pictures of

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,400
our different

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:07,760
conferences we

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,559
of course this year the conference ended

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,919
uh last

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:15,600
saturday uh in

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:19,200
in 2019 we had the first continental uh

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,320
conferences so in tokyo for asia

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,760
and in assumption paraguay for latin

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,200
america

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,720
our conference was in almeria in 2019

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:34,480
and we even had a bus with libokon

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,480
with the libocon sign this year the the

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,679
conference

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,120
was supposed to be in germany nullberg

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:46,559
but it was a virtual event

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,600
let's now switch to

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,960
something where libreoffice is is a key

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,240
product

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,159
standard and interoperability we all

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,200
know that

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,400
interoperability is a challenge

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:06,080
we most many people use

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,720
proprietary formats for interoperability

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,880
they think that they have solved the

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,559
interoperability challenge by

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,679
adopting microsoft office format

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,520
i will show you that this is just an

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,880
illusion

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,919
those formats are extremely bad and are

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,840
built to

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:33,440
basically do not allow interoperability

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,440
and they are

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:42,400
designed for lokin uh

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:44,720
this is uh you see the is a sticker from

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,440
free software foundation on the left

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,960
side

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,600
and on the right side there is a

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,159
fantastic manual from microsoft how to

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,720
lock in your clients

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,880
is i don't know if it's still available

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,760
on the on the network

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,240
but it was available i have downloaded

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,559
if you are

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:08,559
interested in it i can send you the pdf

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:12,000
so our answer to interoperability

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,520
is open document format of course it's a

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,039
challenge

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,919
open document format has not the money

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:26,320
of microsoft behind it

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:29,760
but is a wildly superior standard format

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,840
this is what uh odf allows you

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,799
to have an interoperable file format

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,000
that

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,120
makes the file completely decoupled

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,919
from the software

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,400
so when it comes to document format you

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,559
have a pseudo standard

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,320
dot dot x it doesn't make a lot of

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,679
difference

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:56,880
doc xls and ppt are legacy ones

00:26:51,679 --> 00:27:00,000
they were a binary representation of the

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,120
what was in the working memory of the

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,559
computer

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,600
but doc xs xlsx and pptx

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,159
are not very much different and then you

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:15,600
have open document format

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,600
which is the the the three

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,360
extensions are od for text ods for

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,520
spreadsheet and odps presentation

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,720
let's make a few examples so you can

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,600
better understand

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,720
what i was saying so let's imagine that

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,080
you have libreoffice at shakespeare

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,399
and from 2017 to 2020 if you

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,440
write to be or not to be that is the

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,880
question

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,919
you will get always get this

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,159
paragraph of course this is the meat of

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,880
the file is not the entire file

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,240
but i and i happy to show you the entire

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,159
file

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:58,159
but this is uh the meat it is uh

00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:01,440
human readable it's easy to understand

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,480
and the references are clear let's say

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,360
that

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,799
microsoft office is a shakespeare in

00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:11,720
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:16,720
in 2018 2019

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:21,600
2020 with office on the desktop

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:24,880
and then 2020 with office 365.

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:29,360
as you can see there's no

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,880
homogen consistency no homogeneity

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:37,279
basically the format changes

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:40,480
there are no communication for the user

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,600
uh to to tell when the format is

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,480
changing

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,799
there is no versioning on on the file

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,480
the only information you have is the

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,320
version of the software that has

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,840
produced the file but not the version of

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,840
the standard

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,440
and let's make another example with

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:04,799
colors so of course our brain

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:08,000
sees red and the computer sees ff000

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:12,320
libreoffice independently from the

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,760
application is always format color

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:19,200
etc office open xml

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:24,559
as fancy xml

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:28,080
tagging as a very creative schema

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:32,640
which is one of the reason uh

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,880
for the huge size of the description

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,760
basically they had they reinvented the

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,440
wheel for

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,559
every um potential standard

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,399
open standard that could be used and

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,760
they implemented the closed

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,600
standard so they had of course to

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,120
describe everything to describe the

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,159
schema

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,440
and also to describe what

00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,960
was in was supposed to be deprecated

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,399
uh by 2010

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,559
and has not been deprecated as of

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:11,919
2020 which means that

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:15,600
we are still using a non-standard

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,880
proprietary format with a

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,520
very bad description

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,279
very difficult to implement even for

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,799
developers

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:29,200
and what is uh also

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,480
hidden is the cost of inadequate

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,279
interoperability this

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,200
is an a document from the nist

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,120
is the cost analysis of inadequate

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,120
interoperability in the u.s capital

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,760
facilities industry

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,760
to make it short i have the document if

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,480
you are interested i'm happy to send you

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,480
the document

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,120
what it tells uh is that in a single

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,080
industry

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,600
is a very big one of course but in a

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,640
single industry

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,640
the cost of interoperability is

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,919
alpha a billion dollar per year

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,399
i repeat is alpha billion dollar per

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,240
year

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:16,720
500 million dollars

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:20,320
that are used to rewrite the documents

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,440
because the original cannot be accessed

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:27,200
because of interoperability faults

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,480
and also the complexity as a

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,320
as a side effect and the side effect is

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,640
that uh

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,799
the number of vulnerabilities is

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,279
extremely high

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,279
this is a research

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,279
commission in 2011 by the german

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,360
government to symantec

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:54,799
as you can see ppt doc xlsx

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,200
xls rtf pdf

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,240
these are the documents used for

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,279
targeted attack

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,880
so for malware and this is

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,559
uh kaspersky in 2000 early 2019 so they

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,640
made a research

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:14,559
in the q4 or 2018

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,000
and they discovered that 70 basically 70

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,519
percent of full

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,360
attacks were carried by an

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:26,000
office document so there is not just

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,960
a problem in interoperability there is a

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,559
problem in

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,679
security and people continue to use

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,640
this format which is less secure

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,480
less robust less interoperable just

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,039
because they've been using it for the

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,080
last

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,039
20 years um of course

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,600
the resistance to change is a big issue

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,000
but

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,799
people should understand that in this

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,279
case

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,919
the chan the change is definitely for

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,919
the better

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,760
last few slides the libreoffice versions

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,679
available

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,519
uh there is a desktop version from tdf

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,679
long-term supported version from

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,600
collabora and cib

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:12,559
online versions from tdf collaborate and

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,559
an android version from collabora ios

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,840
and apple store from collabora

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,840
and windows store from cib so basically

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,360
as i was saying before libreoffice is

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,919
available on every platform

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,399
and all this product in some cases they

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,919
don't carry the libreoffice product

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:35,840
on android you should look for collabora

00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:39,120
mobile or collabora online

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,320
but they are totally based on on

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,440
the libreoffice engine uh

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,159
last announcement libreoffice seven

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,519
these are the main new features so the

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,399
f1.3 support

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,440
this stand a real standard makes

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:57,360
progress

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,519
by declaring the version of the standard

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,559
skill graphic engine and gpu

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,919
acceleration

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,960
and this is an ongoing effort of

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,480
improved

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,960
microsoft office compatibility we have

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,040
also aligned to the last version of

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,119
files we cannot declare

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,119
the version we are aligned because we

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,800
don't know which version we are aligned

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,320
to we we know

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,119
that these formats are produced by the

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,480
last version of microsoft office

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,240
um user bases libreoffice user base

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,839
estimate

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,000
we estimate to have around 200 million

00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,240
users

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,520
more or less 100 are unique users

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,399
another 100 million are

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,800
using also another office suite can be

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,879
of any kind

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:54,399
so online a proprietary another

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,040
free office suite this is based on the

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,480
fact that

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,920
libreoffice has basically 100 of desktop

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,200
linux

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,079
10 of desktop windows users and 10

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,800
of desktop mac os users but as there are

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,920
some

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,119
duplication we uh we

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,000
we decreased the number by 20

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,839
to the 200 million users i was telling

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,800
you before

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,800
what we are working at uh educating the

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,640
enterprise is about getting professional

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,480
support for libreoffice

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,040
it's amazing that most enterprises

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,640
using libreoffice are not giving back

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,839
anything

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,240
um i would say 95 percent of the

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,839
donation that keep the project

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,440
uh that

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,240
maintain the project are from

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,240
individuals

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,280
so we should educate the enterprise is

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,400
about

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,280
giving back they can buy an lts version

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,280
they can

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,000
pay developers to solve bugs

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,320
they can pay developers to to create to

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,880
develop new features there are many

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:11,280
different ways we are

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,160
accelerating our investment on the

00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,880
certification

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,440
program we already have a certification

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,760
program

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:23,839
there are around 50 developers and

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:27,760
20 to 30 people certified for

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:31,040
migrations and trainings because

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,480
being certified allows people

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,960
to enrich their cv

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,119
and potentially make money with

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,400
libreoffice

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,320
and of course educate people to help

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,520
migration from microsoft office to

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,520
libreoffice

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,119
based on professional support we have

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,960
published a

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,240
migration protocol and a training

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,359
protocol they are

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,200
available for everyone on on our website

00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:02,400
and they are reference documents

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:05,760
for everyone so this was my last slide

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,119
thank you so much for listening i will

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,560
stop sharing

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:14,079
so that you can see my face uh i mean

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,079
you you are not going to

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,359
this is not a big scene my face is not a

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,800
big advantage but at least

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,839
i mean you know who you are speaking to

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,839
or you are talking to

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,000
i don't think i see any questions in the

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:41,760
people is is too shy in north carolina

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,440
i have a question sure so you were

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,240
you were talking about corporations yes

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,720
uh you don't have that big a hit right

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,160
there

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,480
are you seeing any trends by the

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,079
corporations to move toward open source

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,520
products generally like libreoffice

00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,720
uh we have many uh you know we have many

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,320
users in the enterprise area the problem

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,880
is that

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,800
we as we don't invoice for a for a

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,400
license we don't know

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:16,079
who they are unless they show up

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:19,680
so for instance in europe we have uh

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:23,520
the third largest italian bank

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,359
we have the french government

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,920
which is a public administration but

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,320
it's a large organization

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,440
we have the italian ministry of defense

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:37,760
we have different regions in spain

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:42,079
we have corporations in

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,480
in different countries in in europe

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,079
we know that there is a very large bank

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,079
i cannot unfortunately

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,119
i'm not allowed to share the name but a

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,760
very large one

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,400
in the states that is using libreoffice

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,440
on

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,599
more or less 40 to 50 percent on

00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:03,839
of the of the desktops

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:07,040
so we have many of them in south america

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,599
there are others in asia

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,040
there are for instance the government of

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,079
taiwan

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,680
is entirely or almost entirely on on

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,119
libreoffice

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,000
and on odf there are several cities in

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,000
japan

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,680
and several large corporations in japan

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:32,160
there are companies in indonesia who are

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,160
using libreoffice for all their needs

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,680
when we know them is because either they

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,839
interact with the community and we are

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,000
extremely happy

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,640
i can make for instance the example of

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,720
an indonesian company

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,240
the indonesian company they they are

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,400
making shoes

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:56,880
their name is sepatu fans

00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,920
and they for they they use libreoffice

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,400
uh they are not a such a large company

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,720
so

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,119
they they don't have the economic power

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,880
also because of the indonesian

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:12,160
you know gross domestic product but they

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,480
what they're doing they are sponsoring

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,480
the local community so they're basically

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,720
they're giving the local community money

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,440
for events

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,880
and this is already i mean it's uh it's

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,599
what we need

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,560
we don't we are not asking uh people to

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,960
go bankrupt

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,480
to buy libreoffice if they cannot do

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,240
this

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,520
but for instance giving money for events

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,000
uh they the indonesian have just

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,000
done a localization what we call a

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
localization sprinter

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,599
for libreoffice seven so to to localize

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,160
and there were different students in

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,599
different schools around the country

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,200
and the the the sepal funds

00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:00,240
gave them uh money

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,880
to pay for connectivity to pay

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,400
for people that had no computer they

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,480
basically

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,480
could rent the computers i mean

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,960
indonesia is not like the states or

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,640
italy where everyone has a computer the

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:20,560
the country has areas

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,480
where it is really poor so

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,079
the difference is astonishing in some

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,240
cases but

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,960
this is what we are looking for you know

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,240
we we don't want people to

00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,960
to give us money if there's no reason

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,160
but let's say that if you use

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,599
libreoffice on

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,400
100 000 desktops i think

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,839
that you should pay some money because

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,359
this is a replacement

00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,720
for 100 000 licenses of microsoft office

00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,079
and we all know

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,720
how much money that is

00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,160
for instance the italian ministry of

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,200
defense

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,119
they have decided that they have

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,680
40 percent of their 100 000 desktops

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,160
with a long-term supported version

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,079
because the other 60 percent

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,480
is not used on a daily basis

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,520
they basically they are soldiers so they

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,359
are not

00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,720
supposed unless they are in an office

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,640
they are not supposed to

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,400
to type write documents or to make

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,880
spreadsheet or presentations but

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,800
sometimes they have to write a document

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:32,240
so uh if the if this is an occasional

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,319
user they use the free version if it is

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,880
a full-time user they have a paid

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,599
version

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:42,640
supported and this is a fair balance

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,119
they're paying quite a lot of money to

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,000
one of the ecosystem companies and i

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,599
think

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,079
you know there are many ways

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,960
we could work with these companies the

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,839
first thing is that they shouldn't be

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,560
shy about getting in touch with the

00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:02,079
community

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,040
as you can see we are normal people

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,240
maybe uh you know we we need glasses to

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,119
look uh

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:13,839
when we are older to to read but this is

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,839
something that happens to everyone

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,280
what do you think italo will drive

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,000
people in the direction

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,319
of maybe contributing even let's say

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,319
maybe contribute a developer to

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:32,880
help out we have seen a

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,119
big increase of interest with with a

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,280
pandemic

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,280
for instance the number of down we had a

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,079
around between 25 and 40 percent more

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,599
downloads

00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:51,599
on a month by month uh

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:55,200
if you think about uh work from home

00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:59,440
uh of course there were people that

00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:03,119
had to stay at home almost on a

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,920
on on a very short notice so not able to

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,640
go

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,400
and buy a product and to so they had

00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,480
they had a computer at home

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,440
basically they downloaded libreoffice

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,800
they could uh

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,079
attend this in some countries we are

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,000
working uh

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:23,119
with the ministry of uh education

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,359
for this uh it's

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:30,880
uh that i think we are seeing uh

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,839
the interest is growing of course uh

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,520
we all know that the culture of uh free

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,400
open source software is not as

00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,440
widespread

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,400
because basically we don't

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,680
invest in communication as much as the

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,720
proprietary

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,200
companies invest and in some cases even

00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:52,640
if we invest we are not as good as

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,079
they are in terms of professional

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,960
capabilities

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,440
so i think there is an opportunity but

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,480
we

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,599
should really work more together

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,480
and i'm really grateful to people like

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,640
you that

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:11,760
you are accepting our talks because

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,960
it's important then then we reach

00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,160
more people we explain that there's

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:22,079
nothing to be scared about

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,960
getting in touch with us and uh

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,040
doing something for the benefit of the

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,960
community we have uh

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,359
many people in the states contributing

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,480
we there is a professor in

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,800
i think is in pennsylvania somewhere who

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,920
is

00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,280
writing manuals for uh

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,319
us professors manuals of libra of

00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,240
libreoffice

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:48,800
according to the let's call agreed

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,319
habits in the united states they may be

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,920
different from

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:57,040
what we know in europe or uh in in other

00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,160
continents so it's uh that there is a

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:03,280
huge ground to contribute

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,079
and thank you

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,680
i have one final question to close do

00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,800
you have any

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:13,599
do you have any plans for um

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,160
like a community events or or i don't

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,520
know if it's called the hackathon

00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,720
where where a lot of people come

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:24,240
together maybe give exposure

00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:28,079
we we do them regularly in

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,240
europe asia and south america

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,119
we find it difficult to do them in the

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,520
states

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:38,560
i have to be really uh

00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:42,079
because first

00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:46,240
you're quite a large country

00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:50,079
general and it's not so easy

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:52,480
to uh to organize that but

00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,760
in the past i remember we we talked with

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,079
todd

00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,000
to organize something but then you know

00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,880
we have limited bandwidth in term of

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,880
manpower so

00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,160
we we unfortunately we don't have a huge

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,280
community in the states because we have

00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,400
many people

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:14,079
maybe the community is big but they

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:17,839
are 500 miles from each other

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:20,160
so it's it's not easy to while with 500

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,480
miles i get to palermo in italy so you

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,880
know

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:28,240
it's a completely different story uh

00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:31,040
we basically live all together a country

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:34,079
that lives all together

00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:37,119
so rome milan to rome

00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:40,160
is less than 300 miles and

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:43,119
this is what we consider you know

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:46,000
north and center and palermo is another

00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,640
300 miles and we consider it south

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and if you look at maine and florida

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,200
it's probably

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,680
a thousand miles

00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:59,839
so it's it's a challenge i can imagine

00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,480
well thank you so much italo this was

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,960
very eye-opening for me i was not aware

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,720
that these products existed now i am i

00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,720
will certainly go look at them

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,720
i would also like to thank everyone for

00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,839
attending i want to thank
