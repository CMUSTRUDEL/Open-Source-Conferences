Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Projects Track

Abstract: LibreOffice was announced in 2010 and will celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2020. During these 10 years, the global community has grown from a small group of volunteers - mostly based in Europe - to a large and diverse group of free software advocates active in most countries. The presentation will discuss the challenges faced by the community during its incredible growth over the past 10 years.

LibreOffice was born as a desktop office suite for Windows, macOS and Linux, and is now available in the cloud as a Saas solution. So, the community is focused not only on development and related tasks as QA and UX, but also on other key activities such as end user documentation and marketing. In addition, there is a specific focus on fundraising, as the project is not backed by a company but is completely independent. The historical overview will be based on software releases, adding facts and figures about the project. The objective is to provide a better understanding of the LibreOffice community to people who have followed the evolution from outside, through announcements and events. To complete the talk, an overview of what can happein in the future.
