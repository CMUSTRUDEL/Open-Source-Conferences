Abstract: “Do What You Can, with What You Have, Where You Are.”— Theodore Roosevelt

Salesforce.org is the social impact center of Salesforce. We are a unique business unit dedicated to creating solutions for nonprofit, educational, and philanthropic organizations so they can have greater impact.

This talk will use the case of the volunteer built and supported Open Source “Ombudsman Cloud Care” application to illustrate how Salesforce.org uses open source technologies not just to build our products, but also to empower our community of collaborating non-profits and educational institutions with a sustainability program we call the “Open Source Commons”.

A Navy Ombudsman is a full time, unpaid volunteer liaison between the command and the sailors’ families. As Mary Crozier says: “It is almost impossible to fully describe how important they are to the families, and explain their value to the Navy at large. Ombudsman are the unsung heroes, and our angels on earth, who keep us all (command, sailors, and families) connected.”

Ombudsman Cloud Care was born out of the long-term needs of Ombudsman but is also specific to the era of COVID. In fact, the tragic and high profile case of COVID on the USS Theodore Roosevelt lead Mary Crozier to assemble a “Tiger Team” of volunteers to build an open source and free-to-use Salesforce Application that could support military families.

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,720
mention quickly that anyone interested

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,640
in salesforce should base their

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,159
purchasing decisions on products

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,240
and services that are currently

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,640
available not necessarily what will be

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,240
in our presentation today

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,159
okay so now that we have the legal stuff

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,200
out of the way let's dive in

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,520
what is salesforce well

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,079
salesforce it's a it's big but it's a

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,960
customer relationship management tool or

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,240
crm providing a shared view of customers

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,960
on one integrated

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,680
online platform and salesforce brings

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,319
companies

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,440
non-profit organizations and educational

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,360
institutions

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,959
and their constituents together into the

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,520
digital age

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,040
but salesforce was founded on three core

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,360
innovations which is

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,480
cloud or multi-tenant technology

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
subscriptions

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,560
and our focus on philanthropy through

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
the one one one model

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,920
the one one one model means donating one

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,760
percent of our time

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
one percent of our equity and one

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,879
percent of our product

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,640
which over the years has amounted to

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,560
very impactful figures

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,319
but giving back is not just a perk of

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,959
working at salesforce it's part of our

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,360
culture

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,200
and a driving force behind why many

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
employees join the company

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,239
and our employees get to give back via

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,920
volunteering

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,920
where salesforce employees are given at

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,879
least seven paid days of volunteer time

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
each year

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,560
uh from volunteering at a school to

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,200
building houses in remote parts of the

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,360
world

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,599
uh we employees are encouraged to use

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,400
our vto to make the world a better place

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,480
in whatever way we choose um we also

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,280
have skills-based volunteering or pro

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,720

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,319
greatest assets our technology and our

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,120
organizations transform and then via

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,080
employee giving or employee inspired

i'm excited to tell you about our case

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,600
management tool

ombudsman cloud care it's an app

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,880
especially for

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,240
military ombudsmen and we like to say

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,800
it's a new

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,199
tool for a new era i think you'll

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,039
understand why soon

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,960
as i continue i'd love to hear in the

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,680
chat if you have a connection or a

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,199
family

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,600
member currently serving in the military

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,960
so let's talk about what an ombudsman is

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
and how important they are to the

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,800
command families

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,400
and most of all why they need this tool

00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,720
the most important thing you need to

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,120
know

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,479
is that a military ombudsman is a

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,479
volunteer

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,560
who serves as a liaison between the

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,639
command and the families

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,479
some of their responsibilities include

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,800
providing and connecting families to

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,479
resources when they're in need

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,960
engaging with the community so that

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,720
families are aware of their services

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,759
and being a reliable source of

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,800
information from the command

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,560
before we talk about the technology

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,560
i'd like to first share a bit about

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,720
myself as well as provide a little

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,280
background on the app's origin

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,960
as you know i'm a sales force consultant

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,720
and i'm also proud to share with you

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,000
that i had the opportunity to serve

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,880
in february well before anyone in our

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,039
region was created

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,280

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,840
should the worst case scenario occur

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,120
say multiple parents of young children

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,319
needing to go to the er

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,560
all at once we had little to no support

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,039
for the impending needs of families in

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,039
crisis

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:17,840
from here on i'll refer to the uss

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,840
theodore roosevelt as the tr

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,680
in addition to lacking local support we

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,680
were not prepared to manage what could

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,759
possibly be a significant increase in

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,639
families needing direct ombudsmen

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,720
support

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,280
it wasn't long maybe a couple of weeks

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,360
before our worst fears became a reality

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,360
the tr's four ombudsmen were using

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,880
various organizational methods and

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,440
communication methods

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,039
that were not helping the situation

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,680
concern became alarm

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,120
as late march rolled in and the covet

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
crisis really picked up

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,080
and we still had no one to turn to in

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,160
fact the resource we normally turned to

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,319
had closed up their doors due to covid

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,560
and stopped answering their phones

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,599
as you can imagine with a carrier of 5

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,080
000 sailors and

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,639
fear of coronavirus on board there were

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,800
many

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,240
many more family members than normal who

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
were desperate to communicate with their

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,759
ombudsman team

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,160
i'll share that it had never occurred to

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,400
me prior to these tragic events

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,800
to ask how the ombudsman maintained

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,199
shared and supported their cases

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,440
to learn that they managed by pen paper

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,440
and shared email was astounding to me

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,680
the crisis brought with it an explosive

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,320
increase to the ombudsman's workload

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,880
these volunteers remember they aren't

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,719
being paid to do this job we're suddenly

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,880
dealing with a 750 increase in man hours

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,159
and a fifteen hundred percent increase

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,440
in personal touches

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,600
like phone calls and emails to make this

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,680
slightly more relatable imagine working

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,640
another sixty hour job

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,160
on top of your current one we could tell

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,200
even then that this increase

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,279
wasn't going to last just a week or two

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,360
these numbers are averages from over

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,600
three months

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,440
one day after fielding another stressful

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,560
call from an exhausted and overwhelmed

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,680
ombudsman

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,240
i wanted them to have a better way i

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
asked

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,200
would it help if you had a tool for case

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,240
management where you could all

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,880
collaborate on cases in one secure place

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
they responded with an enthusiastic yes

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,440
definitely

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,440
and i knew that by utilizing my skills

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,000
in salesforce i had the opportunity to

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,839
help them

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,120
in a new way wow thanks mary

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,880
we'll be able to follow along with

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,800
mary's story in a few minutes but let me

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,279
take an opportunity to share more about

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,519
our culture of open source at

00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,360
salesforce.org

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,680
and the tools that mary soon learned

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,880
were available to her

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,200
open source development is in the dna of

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,200
salesforce.org

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,320
in our nonprofit and education cloud

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,760
products

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,760
there are these are just some photos

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,240
from the earliest community meetups what

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,120
we call

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,120
community sprints you may know them as

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,000
more of a hackathon type event

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,440
back in around 2010. in the early days

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,519
there were only a few people working on

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,399
the earliest versions of our open source

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,079
products

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,760
and we've gone from a few scrappy

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,200
engineers building one nonprofit

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,920
fundraising tool called the

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,519
nonprofit success pack to a full-fledged

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,079
range of products being used by more

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,360
than 46 000 non-profits across the globe

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,560
today

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,920
and i'll share a little bit more about

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,399
what our community sprints look like

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,200
today

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,640
a bit later in the presentation like i

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,360
mentioned on the last slide

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,399
open source is in our dna salesforce.org

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,160
currently has six

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,880
different open source products for

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,279
non-profit and educational customers

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,040
including fundraising grant management

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,760
program management higher ed

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,680
and k-12 as well as volunteering and

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,279
this makes it possible for our generous

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
community to collaborate

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,040
and improve upon the products in a

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,959
trusted and transparent way

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,880
and to build innovative custom open

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,120
source solutions like mary has

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,640
that complement our products since the

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,760
very beginning we've watched our

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,440
community contribute

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,839
incredible solutions back into the

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,440
community just like mary

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,360
and we built some pretty cool tools to

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,959
make all this collaboration happen so

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,839
let me pass it on to david and he can

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,839
share more about that

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,839
thank you corey building open source

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,839
products and all the more so fostering

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,399
an open source community around those

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,640
products

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,800
requires that we have a robust set of

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,320
tools to make collaboration and sharing

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,440
possible

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,839
throughout the years we've built the

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,760
nonprofit success pack eda which is our

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,839
education data architecture

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,160
and other open source applications we've

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,760
also built a suite of tools

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,959
that are designed to support building

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,240
apps collaboratively on salesforce

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,920
we call these tools the cumulus ci suite

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,600
they're built around a core framework

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,120
called qmilci

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
and they've been steeped in open source

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,560
collaboration from the beginning

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,320
we use them to build our products

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,000
including the nonprofit success pack and

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,680
others you might be familiar with

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,360
and we also share those tools with the

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,800
community as free and open source

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,800
software themselves

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,200
not just to support the the community

00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,920
around npsp eda volunteers for

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,320
salesforce

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,079
outbound funds and others but also to

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,240
jumpstart development of further

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,839
community driven products that enhance

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,279
what's available to nonprofits and

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,600
educational institutions on the

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,480
salesforce platform

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,320
today cumulus ci suite tools are used to

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,920
build both open source and commercial

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,920
products at salesforce.org

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,720
they're used by partners and isvs that

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,920
are part of the salesforce.org ecosystem

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,360
and they're used by community

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,959
contributors who build their own

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,920
applications and their own tools on

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,200
salesforce

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,399
and who work with the products that

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,880
we've created and shared with the

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,880
community

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,160
our tools are really designed to create

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,560
space

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,800
for seamless collaboration and sharing

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,320
on the salesforce platform

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,760
you can if you're familiar with other

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,680
technology stacks you can think of the

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,839
cumulci suite as filling

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,680
a number of roles some of which are are

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,320
broadly analogous to tools like

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,440
make or setup tools and pip in the

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,000
python ecosystem or npm for javascript

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,079
but we also cover a broad swath of use

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,480
cases and support user roles that start

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,240
at

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
with developers and testers at the very

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,519
beginning of product development

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,680
and carry through all the way to

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,720
delivery into the hands of end users who

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,560
are going to

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,120
go out and achieve their important work

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,320
using these products

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,800
the core of our tool is chemical ci

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,440
which we think about as a framework for

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,440
defining

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,079
portable automation automation that

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,240
builds a tailored salesforce environment

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,480
in which a user can achieve work on an

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,360
application

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,800
once that space has been built out qmlci

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,200
offers further tools for

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,680
developers for testers but also for

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,600
community members and product managers

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,839
and other users to collaborate in

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,360
building an application

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,519
and once some work has been achieved in

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,320
those environments kmlci integrates with

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,240
github

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,240
and with the salesforce api to manage

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,880
pull requests continuous integration

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,959
builds

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
and package releases so the automation

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,000
that we create using qmilci

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,320
spans across the whole product

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,519
development pipeline and each user role

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,600
that plays a part in that pipeline

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,279
on top of cumulative we've built four

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,360
user experiences

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,720
the first is cci our command line

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,440
interface that's used by

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,160
product developers by testers and others

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,560
a second

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,320
meta ci is our continuous integration

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,120
app that's designed just for salesforce

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,680
products and runs on heroku

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,760
a third is meta deploy our customer

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,279
facing web-based installer solution

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,920
which you'll see a little bit more later

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,199
in the context of ombudsman cloud care

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,639
and the fourth is mateco

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,639
a web application that we're still

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,240
developing that makes it easy for

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,160
non-technical users to create

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,839
contributions to a project and

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,399
participate in the development life

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,720
cycle

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,079
even if they don't come from a

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,160
development-oriented background

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,600
all these applications are free and open

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,720
source

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,639
and what i think is one of the most

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,880
exciting applications of these tools

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,399
is supporting the open source commons

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,279
which is one of our key programs that

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,760
corey will introduce

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,760
thanks david the open source commons

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,800
program was created to provide these

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,600
types of tools

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,920
as well as resources um we can kind of

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,959
think of it as an incubation framework

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,720
of sorts

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,279
to our community to make open source

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,279
development easier and more equitable

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,240
we want all members of our community not

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,920
just developers to be able to contribute

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,639
i'm so excited to work for a company

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,480
that has a program vision like this one

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,720
open source commons is a community of

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,639
mission driven individuals

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,480
working together to solve the world's

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,320
most challenging problems

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,160
we do this by actively listening to each

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,240
other we educate each other

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,000
we bring our passion our experience and

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,279
our technical know-how to projects that

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
can be replicated

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,320
and then shared throughout the

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,639
salesforce ecosystem and

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
we purposely work to remove barriers to

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,320
entry so that everyone can be a part of

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,000
this vision

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,680
i really love this slide because you can

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,959
see the amazing faces of some of our

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,040
community members

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,199
over 300 people joined us for our

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,240
community sprint events this year alone

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,920
even digitally but we had only so much

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,920
room on the slide

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,040
we feel our values are just as important

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,880
as our vision

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,720
we want all members of our community to

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,600
feel like they can make a meaningful

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,759
contribution

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,000
regardless of their technical skill

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,360
their age their education level or their

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,079
background

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,320
we increase impact by empowering teams

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,160
of individuals to create solutions that

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,000
serve a larger community

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,000
and they scale to improve the lives of

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,920
hundreds or thousands

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,720
and with innovation we believe in

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,079
technological innovation as a multiplier

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,560
open source commons reduces

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,720
inefficiencies especially in teams

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,600
duplication of effort and barriers to

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,360
sharing

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,120
this allows teams to collaborate and

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,839
develop scalable and repeatable

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,160
solutions for the salesforce platform

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,839
and of course inclusivity as mentioned

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,839
we welcome all contributions

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,680
every voice is crucial and no

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,440
contribution is too small

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,040
solutions are most effective when

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,160
informed by diversity

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,320
and inclusivity great ideas come from

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,560
unexpected or quiet voices and from

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,640
questioning certainty and expertise

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,240
in fact we have an unofficial mascot

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,039
named sprinty who you can see on the

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,280
screen here

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,760
our events are so inclusive even a t-rex

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,280
is welcome

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,280
but most contribution work actually

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,839
happens during these open source

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,839
community

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,000
sprint events we host each year in the

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,199
united states and europe since about

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,039
2015.

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,280
they're the heart or the family reunion

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,959
of open source commons program

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,120
which may have been apparent from the

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,799
images on my prior slide

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,559
attendees get to spend two days working

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,640
together to brainstorm and develop

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,919
solutions for a variety of use cases

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,160
whatever they want

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,320
solve for gaps and product offerings

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,600
create or improve documentation

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,160
and have organic conversations that fuel

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,360
future open source projects and this

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,120
year we've had to go for

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,799
fully digital of course but our

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,559
community continues to show up

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,960
and has been working on nine different

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,200
projects to get them ready to contribute

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
our next big virtual event is in january

00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,520
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,240
and we're excited to include the

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,440
ombudsman cloud care team in that event

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,760
now that you know a bit more about the

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,919
open source community we have at

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,520
salesforce.org

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,840
let's go back to mary and continue the

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,160
story of how ombudsman cloud care came

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,160
to be

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,280
speaking of teams i'll jump back in with

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,960
a brief story of how our team developed

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,400
initially i thought and this was

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
pre-crisis mode

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,640
this will be a great project for me to

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,960
help with i can do this totally on my

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
own

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,799
but i quickly realized this was not the

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
time to be tinkering

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,280
at the first sign of impending crisis i

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,000
started reaching out to my network

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,039
i ended up meeting michael kolodner a

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,880
non-profit consultant and salesforce mvp

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,120
within a few weeks we brought in shelly

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,120
to be our ombudsman liaison

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,120
she exemplifies the caring and nurturing

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,720
nature of who you'd want looking after

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,080
and speaking out on behalf of our

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,320
ombudsmen

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,080
as the covet crisis came to a head i was

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,400
involved more and more directly helping

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,720
the command families behind the scenes

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,240
we soon realized the need for more help

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,000
especially if we intended it to be

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,919
available to many other commands and

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,799
their ombudsmen

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,120
we needed more technical expertise and

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,960
as you saw from david's slides earlier

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,160
there are some release engineering tools

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,799
involved in packaging

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,720
that we just didn't have experience in

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,480
our tiger team grew to five and is

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,280
stronger because we brought in different

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,520
skills to the team

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,240
so let's talk about case management and

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,480
what that means for military ombudsmen

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,559
ombudsmen are volunteers as i said and

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,880
they have zero budget to spend

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,600
and they're only authorized to be given

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,559
paper

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,559
pins and a phone as mentioned previously

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,400
the ombudsman had some organization and

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,799
efficiency problems that they couldn't

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,039
solve easily using these simple tools

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,360
right in the middle of a crisis so we

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,039
started with three primary objectives

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,919
for the app

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,440
we empower them via collaboration tools

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,640
instead of texts

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,520
emails group messages social media

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,600
groups

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,120
they can now correspond with each other

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,400
on a case from within

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,720
their own secure system in addition

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,600
they can share and store attachments and

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,720
keep a record

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,240
of all communication specific to that

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,640
case

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,159
we granted them situational awareness by

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,320
giving them the ability

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,159
to hand off to each other seamlessly

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,559
because everything about a case

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,679
happens within a case as well as the

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,880
capability of

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,679
updating command as necessary

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,440
lastly ombudsman can be highly efficient

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,240
thanks to automations

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,559
standard email responses can now be sent

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,320
to the most commonly asked questions

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:43,280
not requiring direct ombudsman contact

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,840
we didn't stop there though as with many

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,520
jobs

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,000
there's the dirty work that has to be

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,720
done and to be an ombudsman you must

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,880
submit monthly reports it's one of the

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,600
more time consuming duties and certainly

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,159
not why they signed up for this position

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,880
this simple task in salesforce used to

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,960
take them

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,840
days to compile now the information is

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,720
all in one place and already in a report

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,720
ready to be sent

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,960
so great we've built this

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,120
solution now what how do we get this

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,440
into the hands of more ombudsmen

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,600
as i said it was time to grow it was

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,600
time to start thinking bigger

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,280
michael being an active member of

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
salesforce.org community

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,520
brought up the idea of reaching out to

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,240
the open source commons team

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,159
we debated our options my biggest

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,640
concern having been through the recent

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,559
tr

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,000
crisis was mostly centered around

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,559
security

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,080
understandable given everything i'd been

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,159
through and my tiger team

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,240
showed an extraordinary amount of

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,679
patience as i came to terms with

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,159
sharing the project publicly in the end

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,159
though

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,480
choosing to join the open source commons

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:59,039
community was in fact helping create

00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,960
a more secure solution excuse me

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,360
ultimately it was the right call for

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,880
three major reasons

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,000
security technical assistance

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,000
and most important validity this is no

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,280
longer our little pet project we're

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,440
peddling in addition the open source

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,320
commons program gave us the valuable

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,799
resources

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,679
we wouldn't normally have access to like

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,799
guidance through

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,120
the salesforce security review process

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,679
training as well as hands-on assistance

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,880
with the salesforce packaging

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,799
a logo designed just for our project

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
and what we're really excited about is

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,840
getting to bring ombudsman cloud care to

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,480
the next community sprint event in

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,080
january

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,880
there was obviously no better way to

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,720
move forward than to ask for help

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,320
we connected with corey here from open

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,080
source commons team

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,000
who joined our efforts and embraced our

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,039
initiative with her support and

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,720
encouragement

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,240
our team grew with the additional

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,760
technical help we needed

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,400
which you will hear more about in the

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,480
coming slides

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,480
as mary mentioned there are many amazing

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,760
benefits to joining the program

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,600
we provide resources for our

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,280
community-led open source projects like

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,840
the ombudsman cloud care app

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,360
to help them succeed and be sustainable

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,280
but for anyone interested in more of the

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,520
technical behind the scenes elements of

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,760
what our program partnership entails

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,200
i've put a process flow here so you can

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
see the responsibilities of the

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,360
community team in green

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,200
and what we do at salesforce.org and

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,720
orange so you can see how an app like

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,200
mary's can go from an idea

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,440
to reality and in the hands of ombudsman

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,120
by partnering with salesforce.org

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,039
so next let's hear from david who will

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,240
show us how an ombudsman can install the

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,039
amazing open source

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,039
application today

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,520
thanks corey so today we're really

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,679
excited that ombudsman cloud care

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,520
is a full-fledged application it's

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,520
available and it's discoverable on the

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,000
salesforce app exchange which is the app

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
store

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,279
for the salesforce platform for

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,360
administrators to bring new

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,799
functionality into their orgs

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,320
for anyone to install it's it started as

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,640
this little community collaboration but

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,960
today it's available on an equal footing

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
with

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,880
the largest commercial offerings and

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,200
it's been vetted and security approved

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,360
as

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,559
mary alluded to so that our users can

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,600
have confidence that they're that

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,039
they're using a solution that will

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,960
protect their data

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,799
and of course it remains free and open

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,440
source and development continues on the

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,000
solution

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,600
in the open on github and is available

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,600
for engagement from the community

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,480
we use metadeploy which i mentioned

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,799
earlier as part of the cumulci

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,480
product suite to offer this custom

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,559
product installer to ombudsman

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,400
that harnesses the same kind of portable

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,880
automation that the occ

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,120
team mary and her colleagues use as they

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,640
build the application themselves

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,320
our installer delivers the embodsment

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,320
cloud care package but it also

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,840
automates setting up the sophisticated

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,000
configuration that was designed by the

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,159
occ team

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,440
by handling these these getting started

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,120
tasks we can bring

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,039
the setup time for an individual

00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,679
ombudsman who's getting started with the

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,320
tool

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,080
down from multiple hours and needing

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,000
specific sales force expertise

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,520
to just a few minutes with little to no

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,200
manual effort

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,279
this makes it easy for an ombudsman even

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
one who's brand new to the salesforce

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,440
platform

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,279
to start working a fully configured

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,039
salesforce work with ombudsman cloud

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,720
care and best practice configuration

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,320
right out of the box

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,159
and one of the things that i think is

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,760
really valuable about this delivery

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,960
solution is that it's open source from

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,960
ends to end

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,240
the package is open source the web

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,159
installer is open source

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
and the automation is also open source

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,799
so ombudsmen who feel

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,640
inspired can not only see what they're

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,400
consuming and using to do their jobs

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,080
they can also become participants in the

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,919
future

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,520
so let's let's shift back over to mary

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,279
to hear more about the future of this

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,679
solution

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,080
yeah so what does the future look like

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,360
well together with salesforce.org and

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,520
open source commons

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,520
we have the power of community through

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,159
participating in community sprints like

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,760
the one i mentioned coming up in january

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,440
individual community member

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,679
contributions

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,360
and unlimited growth potential with the

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,240
technical

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,120
assistance required to keep expanding

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,080
our reach why is that important

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:18,400
even after our app has launched well the

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,760
navy alone has 1474 ombudsman serving

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,640
commands at this time

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,320
and they all deserve to have this tool

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,200
ombudsman from other branches of the

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,000
military have

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,440
also expressed interest and last but

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,159
certainly not least

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,120
our ombudsmen using the app right now

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,360
are regularly

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,480
adding to their wish list they've seen

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,000
the light

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,840
and they want more so as i come to a

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,840
close on the story of our app

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,400
i'll leave you with we're more than just

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,320
an app this is a mission

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
we've already made significant upgrades

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,000
which i'm excited to

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,720
share they include for the military

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,520
families

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,200
who quite literally demanded a better

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,679
system for communication

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,720
a community help portal where they can

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,440
submit a case

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,039
directly to the ombudsman we also wanted

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,039
to keep our ombudsmen happy

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,360
we all know that user adoption can be

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,600
the failure of any new cool tool

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,559
so an ombudsman training program was

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,320
necessary

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,480
it introduces ombudsman to the

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,960
technology and they leave with a new

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,080
skill to add to their resume

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,000
last but not least did you know military

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,200
spouses have a 24

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,919
unemployment rate an exciting aspect of

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,720
our initiative

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,960
is that all of our command orgs get a

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,640
team of sales force military admins

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,600
composed of veterans and military

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,480
spouses

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,279
certified in salesforce they're ready to

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,080
help them through

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,520
training sessions and open office hours

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,440
these new admins have their

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,279
certification in salesforce

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,240
but they're in need of work experience

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,520
as they transition either back to work

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,919
or into the tech field to date

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,760
we've had four military spouses who've

00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,960
been able to leverage their experience

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,320
with this initiative

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,760
into offers of employment corey thank

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,880
you again for your support

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,640
and over to you thank you mary

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,399
so much for sharing your story with us

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,799
today i continue to be

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,559
so inspired by what you all have built

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,039
um i know it's been an incredible six

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,440
months

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,120
um and i'm happy to have had the chance

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,480
to really get to know you in the team so

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,000
thank you

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,000
we're almost done with our presentation

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,159
today um we'll have lots of time for q

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
a i think but before we jump in i just

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,679
wanted to share a little bit more about

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,360
some of our other open source commons

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,520
projects

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,520
like i mentioned earlier we have nine

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,760
active community teams just like mary's

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,840
who are hard at work on their own ideas

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,279
some are apps like mary's but others are

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,520
quite different

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,279
a couple i'll highlight today is the the

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,919
uh or a few actually would be the summit

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,320
events

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,760
app um they're an events app which

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,679
started at the university of st

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,600
thomas and they're about to go through

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,000
the same security review process the

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,760
ombudsman cloud care app did this summer

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,039
and they plan to be available for

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,440
installation uh later this spring

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,679
um we have a team called diversity uh

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,799
equity and inclusion who started at our

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,399
philadelphia sprint event in 2019

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,080
uh they're doing incredible work in

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,000
partnership with us to

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,440
increase diversity at our community

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,360
sprint events

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,520
and last but certainly not least the

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,840
npsp videography team

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,760
who is our longest running active open

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,480
source commons project

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,039
they got their start at the 2017 chicago

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,440
sprint

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,960
and they write their own scripts record

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,960
all their own voices

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,159
and perform all video production to

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,480
create short how-to videos for the

00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,880
salesforce.org

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,679
non-profit open source products they

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,760
have over

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,120
50 videos up on their youtube channel

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,880
right now

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,799
to learn more about our other projects

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,520

sfdo dash community dash sprints like

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,520
you see on the screen here

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,760
well we hope you enjoyed our

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,640
presentation today um but before we dive

into the q a

00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,679
um we wanted to make sure you had some

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,880
resources so you could learn a little

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,679
bit more about what we talked about

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,960
today

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,720
um i would recommend you take a

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,000
screenshot of the slides so you can save

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,760
them for later

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,039
just remember bitly links are case

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,880
sensitive um

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,559
but um i'll keep this screen up while we

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,480
transition to questions so if you have

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,520
any please enter them in the chat or

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:21,120
raise your hand um and or unmute

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,840
to ask away okay do we have any

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,840
questions sherman

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,600
well let's see

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,840
david do we have any i do see some chat

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,840
here

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,380
okay someone else should unmute because

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,840
i'm the only one talking

00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,320
[Laughter]

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,520
yeah we heard from uh irina in the in

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,960
the chat thank you for

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,200
for coming arena that you're interested

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,919
in grants management with uh

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,120
a non-profit and curious about our our

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,080
products corey can

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,600
um maybe give our arena some pointers in

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,120
the right direction to good resources

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,080
about grants management

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,320
yeah absolutely um probably the best

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,600
thing to do would be to go to the

00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,039
salesforce.org website

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,640
where you can actually look at the

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,159
different products that we offer for

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,320
nonprofits

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,600
and there you'll also find the power of

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,000
us 10 program

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,880
information and that's the program i

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,120
mentioned before

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,320
where we actually donate 10 sales force

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,519
licenses

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,279
um to qualified nonprofits so if you are

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,880
um a non-profit and you don't have

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,559
salesforce today you can

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,559
you can look into getting it for free we

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,200
have a 30-day trial as well where you

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,600
can

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,760
get a full implementation of salesforce

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,880
and our nonprofit cloud products

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,760
um and play around for a month um so i

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,840
definitely recommend going there

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,360
we have a great question from shelly in

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,600
the in the chat as well

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,880
what are common misconceptions people

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,480
have about open source

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,320
events do you want to speak to that

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,880
corey that's a great question

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,440
yeah um i think one of the problems that

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,720
we see

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,120
with um open source community in general

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,760
is

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,279
kind of a lack of trust and a lack of

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,200
sustainability

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,000
um so you know we've all probably heard

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,039
of apps

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,720
that you know have we've installed or we

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,720
know someone who's installed maybe a

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,559
year ago or we're utilizing it or a

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,279
feature or functionality

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,039
outside of the salesforce world and we

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,039
go and try and install it

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,240
but it doesn't work or we're getting an

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,080
error or

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,279
you try and reach out for support on the

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,039
github

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,440
repo where you log in issue and you

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,039
never get a response

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,120
that's the primary problem we are trying

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,919
to solve with the open source commons

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,880
we want to create um teams that are

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,159
sustainable

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,240
that turnover can happen that the people

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,080
that install the app or utilize the

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,360
features and services will always be

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,200
supported it can always be trusted

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,880
so that's sort of something that we're

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,679
trying to battle against

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,279
um also with events themselves

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,080
specifically

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,440
that you have to be a developer right i

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,600
think

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,440
i'm just gonna probably actually i'm

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,559
gonna stop sharing because i like seeing

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,480
everyone's faces

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,880
um let me just transition my side is

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,519
that okay normal i'm gonna stop sharing

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,399
there we go hi um but you don't have to

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,799
be a developer

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,679
um and as we mentioned in our sort of

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,799
strive for

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,279
equality and equity um in our events

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,600
is you can show up to one of our events

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,720
and not really even have an idea of

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,159
what you want to work on you definitely

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,480
don't have to be a developer

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,279
you could work on writing you could work

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
on

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,559
you know testing something you could

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,200
work as a thought leader you can

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:51,039
contribute your personal experiences

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,159
um so we actually have a really wide set

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,840
of skills that

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,840
people in our community bring to our

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,679
events and it makes them

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,360
much better for it um so great question

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,640
david would you like to add anything i

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,679
know you've been to a few of our events

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,039
before and you're

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,720
very well versed in the open source

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,480
community i have

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,399
i think i really just want to emphasize

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,879
that last point that you brought up

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,079
cory that there there can sometimes be a

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,440
perception that

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,839
open source well it's in the name it's

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,200
about code code that you can see that

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,000
you can share that you can collaborate

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,200
on but always

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,599
with that that core identity that you

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,800
can

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,679
write or read or test code and sometimes

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,040
that's true

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,879
but i think one of the things that we

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,399
work very very hard on

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,000
is opening up the space around code for

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,000
open source participation or

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
participation in the spirit of

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,679
open source and making that available

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,440
now for folks who are not deeply

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,560
familiar with the salesforce platform

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,480
there's often two broad tracks that

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,320
that folks who work in our ecosystem

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,240
fall into on the one hand there are

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,000
administrators who work primarily with

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,839
on platform

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,440
point-and-click tools that are every bit

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,640
as complex in their way as code but

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,200
which don't involve

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,400
writing code as such on the other hand

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,920
there are developers who are more

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,560
traditional

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,680
writers of apex and javascript or python

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,520
in my case

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,839
code one of the things that i think is

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,520
so valuable about our open source sprint

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,720
program and some of the focuses that we

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,000
put in that program is bringing those

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,520
two tracks together

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,200
helping them to collaborate giving them

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,200
the tools to collaborate

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,800
without putting up a wall between the

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,200
different classes or

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,359
kinds of contributions putting everyone

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,160
on an equal footing as contributors

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,640
yeah and just to add to that before we

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,280
went

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,520
you know covid world and we had to stop

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,800
meeting in person we had actually added

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,000
a full day's worth of

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,920
on-site training in these open source

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,160
tools before our events

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,079
with the sole purpose of bringing you

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,040
know what is continuous integration

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,280
tools

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:54,079
not normally you know used by admins or

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,240
admins intimidated by them or

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,839
non-developers being intimidated by them

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,160
and we really wanted to bring them and

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,720
just say hey it's not as complicated as

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,200
it sounds

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,320
you can do this you can contribute to

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,720
open source

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,760
using continuous integration tools and

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,240
succeed

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,079
um and so michael claudiner who mary

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,760
mentioned on her team

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,359
has um for the first time started using

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,400
these tools over the last six months

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,400
with the help of

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,680
another community member nick who really

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,400
sort of mentored

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,880
um and helped out with the team so we're

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,599
seeing

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,920
the ability for admins or declarative

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,480
developers non-code developers

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,440
really be able to drive into you know a

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,880
cli type

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,560
interface where they never thought they

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,280
could before um

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,480
and i'm super happy about that really

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,480
inspired by our community for diving in

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,520
um we do have another question in the

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,280
chat

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,280
um are there opportunities to volunteer

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,640
for non-profits as it pertains to

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,960
salesforce

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,040
um yeah absolutely um

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,240
there's a a really big non-profit

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,000
community um

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,240
if you have a salesforce org you can

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,599
actually log into the trailblazer

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,200
community it's called

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,440
if you wanted to get a free developer

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,359
org you can access it

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,839
that's the primary community where

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,560
everyone talks and chats and shares

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,760
information

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,119
and learns and often you'll see

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,040
non-profits

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,200
sort of posting for jobs sort of thing

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,079
looking for help

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,000
it's sort of a double-edged sword um we

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,680
generally don't recommend those

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,119
just getting into development just

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,000
getting into coding

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,520
using a non-profit to get experience and

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,040
upskill themselves because of the

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,400
negative benefits it can have on a

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,960
non-profit

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,240
but if you work with a non-profit and if

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,920
they have a

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,000
you know a couple simple requests that

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,280
you're confident you can deploy that you

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,400
can test well

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,480
yes they can be um a great place to

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,880
start to volunteer your time

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,920
um just be careful don't try and do too

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,920
much or

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,040
um the nonprofit will just suffer at the

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,359
end of the day but

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,400
great question don't forget too that

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,160
nonprofits have

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,079
lots of many nonprofits have lots of

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,800
volunteer needs that could be salesforce

00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,000
adjacent but not necessarily doing

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,599
development on the platform

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,520
for example if you've got a nonprofit in

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,040
your community that are users of the

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,560
nonprofit success pack and maybe

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,800
volunteers for salesforce

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,160
they might need help with data entry

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,280
they might need help running an event

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,280
and logging in

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,119
attendees those are things that you can

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,599
do for them to help you gain familiarity

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,160
with

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,800
the salesforce non-profit ecosystem as

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,880
as a user and get a feel for

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,079
what these nonprofits use and what they

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,800
need to

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,560
help yourself understand the background

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,400
of how they work and what their pain

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,320
points look like on the platform

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,720
yep and if you just want to learn more

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,560
about the salesforce platform in general

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,160
as well as our nonprofit cloud and

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,000
education cloud products

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,280
there's free learning you can do it's

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,520
called trailhead

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,640
and if you google salesforce trailhead i

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,240
can't remember if i put it on the

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,880
resources slide or not

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,520
you can walk through a point and click

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,640
user

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,640
interface of learning um with trailhead

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,000
to learn all the things about salesforce

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,720
it's quite incredible

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,160
um it helped me get my certification um

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,560
four or five years ago now

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,000
um and we see a lot of people posting

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,680
about it on twitter and

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,079
getting their certifications from it so

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,160
it's it's pretty cool

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,160
lastly if i can add just one more

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,520
resource for those who are

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,480
we're looking to find salesforce

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,880
experience make connections find mentors

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,720
check out your local community groups um

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,960
i've i've been to community groups as

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,560
both a participant and a speaker in

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,320
lots of cities across the united states

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,520
i've even done virtual talks with folks

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,880
outside the u.s

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,320
they are uniformly incredibly welcoming

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,640
including welcoming to folks who are

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,160
very new to this ecosystem so

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,920
um the website i think is it's

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,680
troublesome communitygroups.com that's

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,119
where you can find your local sales

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,839
force community

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,800
many cities will have an admin group a

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,720
developer group

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,000
often a non-profit specific group as

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,800
well check them out

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,160
they're they're almost without exception

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,920
fantastic people

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,520
um you can make great connections there

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,480
and learn a lot

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,240
yeah and norma's actually uh posted a

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,480
question here um asking if we're about

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,520
to do or if we're planning to do virtual

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,040
training

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,800
um before our january event

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,640
so i'm going to look to david because

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,160
your department really runs those

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,720
trainings but

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,319
to generally answer the question we we

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,440
put it on pause when we had to really

00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,599
reconfigure

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,960
you know in-person events to digital it

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,480
was to be

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,079
totally honest something we never

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,119
thought would work um

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,960
we always did in-person events um

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,560
and our community really came out and

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,200
supported us and surprised us

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,839
and we've actually had almost more

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,640
success

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,720
doing these projects virtually and

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,680
events virtually than we have in person

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,720
which is

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,599
incredible um so while we haven't yet

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,839
planned a specific training for

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,720
community on the cumulus ci suite of

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,079
tools

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,760
there's nothing but our own sort of

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,400
you know licking that cookie to get it

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,960
done so to speak so

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,960
i'll look at david and and he can say uh

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,720
whether or not we'll do it or not

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,800
well if it's if it's up to me i'd be

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,480
happy to do it um we certainly have to

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
have to talk about scheduling and all of

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,319
that

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,319
uh but it's something i really enjoy

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,920
doing in the meantime

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,240
if you're interested in training
