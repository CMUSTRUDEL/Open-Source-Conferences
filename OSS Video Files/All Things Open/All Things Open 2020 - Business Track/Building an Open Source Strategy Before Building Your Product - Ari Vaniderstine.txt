Title: Building an Open Source Strategy Before Building Your Product - Ari Vaniderstine
Publication date: 2020-12-16
Playlist: All Things Open 2020 - Business Track

Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Business Track

Abstract: For many companies, an open source strategy is a way to give back to the community or to raise awareness about a product. But what if you built your open source strategy alongside, or even before, your product?

This talk breaks down this seemingly backwards strategy of building alongside the greater developer community and gives the audience guidance on embracing open source even before releasing a product. We'll look at Embark Studios, a Swedish game studio, which has been making a splash in the Rust community and in the broader open source community. The talk will take a deep dive into the strategy behind their new approach to technical platform development and their decision to embrace open source on day 1.

	00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,400
so hello everyone

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,480
uh this is actually my first time

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,559
attending all things open either as an

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,719
attendee or as a speaker

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,279
so i'm really excited to be here uh i'm

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,160
joining tonight from frigid sweden

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,000
where the sun set several hours ago and

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,439
it's hovering around freezing

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,359
but hey at least i didn't have to get

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,039
any jetlag to talk to you all today

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,439
so today i'm going to talk about my

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,559
experiences with building products

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,840
and building open source strategies so

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,440
first let's talk about

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,040
products it's really easy when you're

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,760
building products to narrow your

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,760
thinking

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,520
to thinking about your product and your

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,559
users in a vacuum

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,360
and not thinking about anything else but

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,399
your product your platform your company

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,879
your engineers

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,120
and even you and me we all exist

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,239
together in an ecosystem of developers

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,680
and technologies for this talk i'm going

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,840
to be calling that the developer

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,400
ecosystem

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,920
the developer ecosystem is a vibrant

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,320
interconnected system

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,360
of different programming languages niche

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,520
communities

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,880
open source projects platforms and

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,920
services

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,080
and the different parts of this

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,960
ecosystem much like a biological

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,000
ecosystem

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,680
depend on each other to thrive the

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,799
products in tech that i'm using to talk

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,320
to you right now

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,280
would not be possible without this

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,400
thriving developer ecosystem

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,960
within this vast ecosystem your product

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,479
or your tech is probably not unique or

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,240
special there's probably many others

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,520
doing the same thing

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,520
but your relationships with the

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,720
community and how the connections that

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,040
you have to other projects

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,119
developers and organizations those could

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,119
be

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,119
so in this talk i'll tell you about my

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,040
company's approach to open source

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,640
and why you should consider taking your

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,200
product development

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,840
from outside of the developer ecosystem

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
into

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,680
the greater developer ecosystem speaking

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,119
of

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,360
that little dot on the developer

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,280
ecosystem is me

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,759
my name is arie and i'm a developer

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
advocate by day and a d d in video game

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,640
nerd by night

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
i've been programming for around seven

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,480
years but for the last few years i've

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,560
been focused on developer relations

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
and product management for platforms and

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
products that are targeted toward

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,040
developers

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,760
right now i'm working at embark studios

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,280
embark is a stockholm based game studio

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,480
we're making a pretty cool game which

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,319
you can see some of my colleagues

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,319
testing here

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,480
but our long-term mission is to blur the

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,480
line between playing and making

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,080
to do that we're building tools that

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,959
enable everyone to create games

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,080
but we haven't released any of that yet

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,319
what we are known for

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,519
right now is our support of the rust

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,160
programming language

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,000
and its open source community and for

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
being pioneers for rust

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,959
open source and game dev and i'll get to

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,959
that later

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,239
these are just a few of the rust open

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
source projects that we've released

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,040
already

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,599
ranging from physics to dependency

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,599
management

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
last year we became gold level sponsors

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,120
of the blender foundation

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,959
a free and open source 3d modeling

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,920
software which we also got the entire

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,120
studio switched over

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,720
to use we also hired two engineers

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,879
to work full time on open source

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,080
projects and we support many others

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,080
through monthly sponsorships

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,159
all of this work is the result of our

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,360
decision to build an open source

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,159
strategy early on before releasing any

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,760
products to the world

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,599
this may seem a little bit backwards

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,200
especially to someone like me who

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,519
works in developer relations usually

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,680
with finished products

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,519
but we have an ambitious vision to

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,200
change how games are built

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
and we think the only way to get there

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,239
is to start with a strong open source

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,080
strategy

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,920
we simply can't do this on our own

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,799
as an example after we started with an

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,400
empty hard drive in late 2018

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,239
our projects have already grown to

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,519
depend on over 500

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,360
different open source projects i'll get

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,040
back to embark later

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,959
first let's talk about products

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,280
so in your typical early product teams

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,600
you're going to focus on hiring product

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,040
engineering and design folks to get a

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,280
first version of your product out to

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,880
market as quickly as possible

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,560
but i mentioned i work in developer

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,040
relations so let's look at how that

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,680
usually fits in

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,840
developer relations or devrel usually

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,520
acts as an interface or a communication

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,919
line between your company

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,000
and the community and here i am vastly

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,199
oversimplifying what community means

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,040
but that is a whole other talk by hiring

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,639
some devrel folks for your product

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
you'll have technical people who can

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,800
help out your technical users

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,720
in an ideal world that devrel team will

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,600
also bring back insights and feedback

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,639
from users

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,160
which can help to improve your product

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,080
but all of this usually doesn't happen

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,639
until after you have a product

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
and those users otherwise who are you

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,520
relating

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
with

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
so in devrel there's some problems that

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,840
are pretty easily solved like which

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,160
events to attend

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,919
which sticker manufacturer to use or

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,520
which languages to write your tutorials

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,639
in

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,840
but these are some of the hardest

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,400
problems i've come across in developer

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,479
relations

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,479
how do we build a community of people

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,360
who care about what we're doing

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,800
and keep them engaged how do we get them

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,479
to give meaningful feedback on our ideas

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,080
and how do we build long-term

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,919
collaborative partnerships

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,919
with different people and organizations

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,880
so when thinking about these hard

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,240
problems

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,080
what if we could get a head start on

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,919
them what if we

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,039
tried to tackle these hard parts first

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,639
before building the product

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,199
if you add developer relations or

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,720
community roles early on

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,440
you could develop your product with its

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,120
place in the ecosystem already in mind

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,400
and while helping that ecosystem and

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,479
community itself grow and thrive

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,160
all well you're collaborating helping

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,080
and receiving help from other people

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,440
in the ecosystem so if we do this

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,680
strategy right

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,440
in theory we can start our product on

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,600
day one with better insights

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,800
and establish community open

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,960
communication lines

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
and potential partnerships all ready to

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,520
go that sounds great to me

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,639
makes my job a lot easier so how do we

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,400
do it

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,560
let's talk about building an open source

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,160
strategy which is like a playbook

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,360
for how your company will engage with

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,360
the developer ecosystem

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,120
when you're building your open source

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,880
strategy there's a few questions you can

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,360
ask yourself

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,639
firstly how are you supporting the

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,560
developers and maintainers that are

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,560
working on open source

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,240
maybe you're sponsoring projects or

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,560
allowing your engineer's time to work on

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,560
issues

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,240
second what are you giving or

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,400
contributing to open source

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
are you releasing all of your code are

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,680
you writing posts or white papers

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,360
or otherwise sharing your knowledge

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,840
and finally how are you communicating

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,080
with all these other actors in the

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,199
ecosystem

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,880
are you participating in open

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,759
discussions or maybe offering up your

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,759
business use cases

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,120
now i could go really deep into the

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,840
ethics of open source

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,479
and i know this is a really hot topic

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,000
today

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,599
but i want to briefly touch on two

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,639
principles to think about

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,720
as you're answering these questions

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,120
first how can you make sure that you're

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,840
giving before taking

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,759
a lot of companies use open source but

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,360
very few contribute back in meaningful

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,360
ways

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
and the second how can you support

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,960
existing solutions

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,960
before building your own now i don't

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,199
believe we need one project to rule them

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
all

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,160
for every use case but historically

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
businesses are very bad at building

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,479
something in-house

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,240
when they could have funded or

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,919
contributed to a solution that already

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,360
exists

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,000
so those are things to think about as

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,919
you're developing your strategy

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,879
as an example let's look at embark's

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,400
open source strategy

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,560
our strategy is brief and it's just

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,080
three parts

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,759
the first one open source by default

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,199
this means that for everything new we

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,360
develop

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,800
we consider if for when it can be open

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560
sourced

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,240
so every time we develop something new

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,479
that's reusable

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,560
not tied to proprietary stuff and will

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,080
be maintained for the foreseeable future

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:43,120
we just make it public the second part

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,399
is leading the conversation as i

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,200
mentioned we're working in a lot of

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,279
spaces like

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,040
open source game dev or the relatively

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,120
young rust programming language

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,720
where there's big problems and no clear

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,560
answers

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
we want embark to drive open

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,920
conversation and collaboration around

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,120
these problems and act as a bit of a

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,440
thought leader

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,279
so we do this by building open projects

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,240
communities and actively inviting people

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,240
to collaborate with us

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,440
and the final part of our strategy is

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,120
strategic support

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,480
we give back to developers who are

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,320
making great things

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,160
and we strategically invest in projects

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,519
and developers that are working towards

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,440
our goals either directly or indirectly

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,200
this can involve monetary sponsorship of

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,200
individuals or projects

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,519
hiring contract work to work on specific

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,680
tasks or allocating our own engineering

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,440
resources

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,279
we strongly believe that companies that

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,240
professionally use and rely on open

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,320
source software

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,440
have a responsibility to support

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,440
developers and maintainers of it

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,640
also our strategy is publicly available

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
there's a link in the slides that i'll

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,839
share later

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,839
but it is on the embark studios github

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,800
so at developer relations conferences

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,720
where i can normally be found

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,880
there's always at least one talk about

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,560
how hard it is to measure the impact of

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,680
devrel

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,800
so if it's hard to begin with in normal

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,320
circumstances

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,240
you can only imagine it gets harder when

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,320
you don't have a product yet

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
all of your pirate metrics acquisition

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,040
activation retention

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,040
those don't work

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,440
we're focused on these really important

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
but also really qualitative results like

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,560
building long-term relationships and

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,560
collaborations

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,920
and these aren't as easy to track on a

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,000
dashboard as

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,839
acquisition or retention but i cannot

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,839
stress how important they are

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,279
so let's give you the results

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,560
and i i could go on and on about how our

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,000
strategy is great

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,560
but i'll let it come from the community

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,079
first image is one of my favorite quotes

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,279
about us and it came just after we

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,480
announced our sponsorship

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,399
of the blender foundation it reads

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,079
embark studios is an established

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,399
supporter of open source software

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,680
with a blog post extolling the virtues

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,600
of open source tools

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,040
and an online portal dedicated to its

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,560
own open source projects

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,920
i was really excited about this because

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,440
it was only a few months after we

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,959
started working with open source and

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,880
already we were getting

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,640
a lot of recognition others use

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,079
fewer words to express how they feel

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,519
like this reddit user

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,839
but nevertheless they follow every

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,360
single project we release

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,959
and there's lots of people who've told

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,240
us about

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,480
how much they appreciate what we're

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,519
doing in the community

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,519
and this has an impact

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,959
the biggest theme that i've noticed

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,680
is how strongly we've been able to build

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,240
up a reputation in the community

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,160
every time someone utters game dev along

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,320
with either rust or open source

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,320
in the same sentence it seems that

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,680
embark is always brought up

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,839
people are excited to see what we're

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,079
building in the space

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,839
and i am so excited to show them

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,839
sometime soon

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,120
so summarizing the results we've got

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,959
this company image

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,800
as a recommended employer for rust

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,240
engineers we've been able to hire

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,560
great talent from the open source

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,680
community and we want to build our

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,480
workforce

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,240
out of these great open source engineers

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,160
we've also got this brand association

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,079
with game dev open source and rust

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,160
and people actively watching what we're

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,600
releasing

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,200
we also have an understanding about the

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,360
landscape from actually being

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,800
in it so those hard problems that i

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,639
mentioned earlier about building

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,959
community and feedback loops or finding

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,000
long-term partnerships

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,760
those seem a lot less hard now and when

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,160
we do release something

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,160
we are set up to succeed because we've

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,600
already established those links

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,600
into the rest of the ecosystem

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,680
so to wrap up you and i

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,680
along with your company my company and

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,920
countless foundations organizations

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,120
projects and individuals

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,519
are all part of an ecosystem

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
and if you want your product to thrive

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,600
in that ecosystem

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,560
you need to understand how you fit into

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,560
the greater landscape

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,480
and if you're like me and you haven't

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,880
yet released your product

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,560
my advice to you is to put that strategy

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,200
first

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,800
don't make open source an afterthought

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,639
don't silo yourself

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,560
when millions of developers are already

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,320
working together on any problem you can

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,560
imagine

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,920
grow your product inside the developer

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,000
ecosystem

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,079
and you can help not only your product

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,480
but the ecosystem as a whole

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,480
thrive

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,839
let's all innovate build and thrive

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:49,600
together

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:51,680
thank you

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,680
