Abstract: For many companies, an open source strategy is a way to give back to the community or to raise awareness about a product. But what if you built your open source strategy alongside, or even before, your product?

This talk breaks down this seemingly backwards strategy of building alongside the greater developer community and gives the audience guidance on embracing open source even before releasing a product. We'll look at Embark Studios, a Swedish game studio, which has been making a splash in the Rust community and in the broader open source community. The talk will take a deep dive into the strategy behind their new approach to technical platform development and their decision to embrace open source on day 1.
