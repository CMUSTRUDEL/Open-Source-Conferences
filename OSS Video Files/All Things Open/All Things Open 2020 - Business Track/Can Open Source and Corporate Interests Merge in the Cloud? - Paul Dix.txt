Abstract: InfluxData is the creator of InfluxDB, the leading time series platform. Customers like Cisco, NASA, PayPal, and Tesla use InfluxDB to harness the explosion of time-stamped data.

In this session, InfluxData CTO and co-founder Paul Dix will discuss and share best practices for how startups can manage differing corporate and open-source interests and talk about the choices InfluxData has made - and learned from - along the way. One of those choices was to build an entirely new multi-tenanted, multi-cloud offering as the core of their future product and commercialization strategy shifting focus from on-premise enterprise software to a cloud delivery model.

At a time when public cloud giants’ intent with open source technologies are under increased scrutiny, the strategies for open source startups’ business models becomes even more critical. The power of the open source community to drive innovation is unsurpassed by any proprietary software solutions and Paul can discuss how InfluxData plans to continue to win commercially while making open source and a cloud offering the critical components of their product strategy.
