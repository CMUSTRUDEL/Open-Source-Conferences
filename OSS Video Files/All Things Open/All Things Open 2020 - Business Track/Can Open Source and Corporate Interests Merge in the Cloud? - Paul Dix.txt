Title: Can Open Source and Corporate Interests Merge in the Cloud? - Paul Dix
Publication date: 2020-12-16
Playlist: All Things Open 2020 - Business Track
Description: 
	Presented by: Paul Dix, InfluxData
Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Business Track

Abstract: InfluxData is the creator of InfluxDB, the leading time series platform. Customers like Cisco, NASA, PayPal, and Tesla use InfluxDB to harness the explosion of time-stamped data.

In this session, InfluxData CTO and co-founder Paul Dix will discuss and share best practices for how startups can manage differing corporate and open-source interests and talk about the choices InfluxData has made - and learned from - along the way. One of those choices was to build an entirely new multi-tenanted, multi-cloud offering as the core of their future product and commercialization strategy shifting focus from on-premise enterprise software to a cloud delivery model.

At a time when public cloud giants’ intent with open source technologies are under increased scrutiny, the strategies for open source startups’ business models becomes even more critical. The power of the open source community to drive innovation is unsurpassed by any proprietary software solutions and Paul can discuss how InfluxData plans to continue to win commercially while making open source and a cloud offering the critical components of their product strategy.

thanks for

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,759
those of you who are in the talk um

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,080
so this session was originally titled

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,440
can

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,679
open source and corporate interests

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,480
merge in the cloud but i've renamed it

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,199
to this

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,119
can open sourcing cloud vendors coexist

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,199
in peace and harmony

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,960
it's mostly about open source

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,080
infrastructure software vendors

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,880
so think databases messaging systems

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,960
ci cd deployment testing cluster

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,559
scheduling and a whole lot more

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,559
basically it's the suite of software

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,399
tools that developers use to create and

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,879
deliver applications and services to

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,320
their

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,320
end users so

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,320
this is based on my experience building

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,360
a business around the open source time

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
series database

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,160
in fluxdb so i started influxdb the

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,840
project and i started a company called

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,320
influx data

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,719
around that has been basically turning

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
this into a business so i'll talk more

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,960
about that in the latter half of this

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
talk

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,799
but in the beginning i wanted to talk

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,080
about what we've seen in the industry

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,520
over time so uh

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,280
so three and a half years ago i think

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,320
just like april of uh

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
2017 uh i gave a talk at another

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,080
conference

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,360
and the talk was titled the open source

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,560
database business model

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,799
is under siege uh

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,600
and basically the idea was uh that

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,960
that the the open source businesses and

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,520
open source vendors

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,960
they were under siege by cloud vendors

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,880
and specifically

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,399
uh the cloud service providers aws

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,960
gcp and azure and then

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,880
in that talk i laid out uh different

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,119
open source business models

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,640
uh so this these are like the business

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,840
models that i came to that open source

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,520
vendors would traditionally use

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,799
uh consulting professional services

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,520
support subscriptions

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,640
oem uh closed source production tooling

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,040
and monitoring

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,000
open core where you ship a proprietary

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,840
forked version

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,520
of the open source and then finally

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,879
software as a service

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,920
now uh i think the models in the red

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,120
are really the only legitimate ones uh

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,720
and they're mainly the ones they're

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
being impacted the most by the cloud

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,840
vendors

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,280
right if you're paying for a cloud

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,080
vendor's managed service

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,360
you don't need uh support or production

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,200
tooling and monitoring

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,640
you just get that from the cloud vendor

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,560
themselves

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,319
so i gave that talk in 2017

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
uh and i thought it'd be interesting to

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,800
to see how things have played out in

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,800
that time

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
in the time since that uh so i went

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
through and i dug up like some blog

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,280
posts from some of the big

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,920
uh open source vendors uh and

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,040
let's take a look at what happened so

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,800
these are kind of like roughly in

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,519
chronological order

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
in february of 2018 elastic had this

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,080
blog post from shy

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
called doubling down on open um and

00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,760
while

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,519
it's saying they're doubling down on

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,519
open what they were doing is

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,200
they're taking some projects that were

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,120
previously closed source

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,319
and they were rolling them into the

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,560
elasticsource

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,360
open source repo but they were doing

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,519
that under

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,760
a totally new license called the elastic

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,959
community license

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,360
which ostensibly was trying to limit

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,879
uh what cloud vendors could do with the

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,239
software basically what

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,519
anybody who would use the elastic

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,720
software to create

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,159
a service might be able to do

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
and they were going to release more and

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,239
more software basically under

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,120
this community license was the idea

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,400
soon after redis labs uh you know the

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,440
big vendor behind

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,560
that has been supporting uh redis uh

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,040
came out with an announcement that

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,760
uh there they have would have extensions

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,439
to redis

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,280
they'll be licensed under their own

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,200
community license and then there was

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,159
this big uproar in the community

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,360
and then uh the co-founder and cto came

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,760
up with this post

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,879
about redis core still being a

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,040
permissive

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,720
three-clause bsd license uh and that

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,840
will continue to be so

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,760
but the the truth here is the real news

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,000
of the story was that redis labs was

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,479
going

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,919
to put more and more software not under

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,600
an open source license

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,520
but instead under a restricted

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,680
community license that doesn't qualify

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,560
as open source

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,759
mongodb famously switched their license

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,680
from a gpl

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,960
or a agplv3 to um

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,400
to a license called the sspl they were

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,720
trying to get it admitted

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,759
into the open source initiative and that

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,680
did not succeed

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,800
this was in october of 2018

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,560
confluent the company behind kafka also

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,880
made their own announcements

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,080
announcements uh so this is in december

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,600
of 2018

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,360
uh so they were basically coming out

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
with their own community license and

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
they would be releasing

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,160
uh a bunch of new software under that

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,479
license

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,840
and not under an open source license so

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,479
the thing that basically happened

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,039
is that the biggest open source vendors

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,400
actually

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,800
pivoted to the point where they're no

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,840
longer open source they went either

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,080
closed source

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,199
or they went source available and the

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,680
funny thing is

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,320
the blog post that each of them wrote

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,120
kind of

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,560
put themselves forward as being open but

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,360
what they were fundamentally doing was

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,960
they were being less

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
open they were going away from open

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,360
source licenses

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,800
um you know as as tyler durden and fight

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
club said

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,840
sticking feathers up your butt doesn't

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,520
make you a chicken just because you

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,560
claim it's open source doesn't mean it

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,199
is just because

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,759
people can see the source code does not

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,160
make it

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,800
open source source available is not open

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,400
source

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,720
it just means other people can see that

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,320
code so

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,759
let's look at what the what the cloud

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,039
vendors did and specifically we're going

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,319
to look at amazon

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,759
um so in 2019

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
you know there was a there was a flurry

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,479
of activity around each one of these

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,919
projects right

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,000
so first on in january of 2019 amazon

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,639
announced document db with mongodb

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,759
compatibility so it's basically their

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,639
closed source offering

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,560
but it is compatible with the mongodb

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,840
api

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,199
uh so then they also announced

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,000
in what was it march of 2019

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,080
uh they have the open distro for

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,120
elasticsearch which they claim

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,479
is not a fork of elastic but

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,560
basically they're creating a new

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,319
distribution they're gathering

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,759
new code around it they say they'll do

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,000
upstream

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,800
you know pushes of code but they're

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,479
essentially

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,319
forking elasticsearch they're

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,280
potentially forking the community

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,400
as well as the code base itself but all

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,919
the code they're releasing

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,759
is actually under an apache 2 license so

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,199
their title to this blog post keeping

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,720
open source open actually

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,960
rings true to me because that's actually

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,199
what they're doing

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:05,120
um so in may of 2019

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:08,240
uh aws launched basically

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,599
kafka compatibility for messaging their

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,840
messaging service

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,800
uh so again they're taking a popular

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,039
open source project

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,120
at least the api of that thing and

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,919
they're releasing a service that is api

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,520
compatible

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,000
that's based on a closed source sas

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,000
offering

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,960
and then aws announced

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
elastic cache for redis with high

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,880
availability so this

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,080
is basically the redis clustering bits

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,960
but offered up

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,560
uh in aws as a service they had already

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
been offering redis

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,560
as a service for a while but now

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,440
offering these clustering bits as a

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,440
service

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,759
is more and more of a competition with

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,759
redis labs the primary vendor behind

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,960
redis

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,360
so the the interesting things

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,919
i think about those open source vendors

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
announcements and amazon's announcement

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,800
is that

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,280
they were both about being more open aws

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,759
message was also about being more open

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,440
and even though i'm in the open source

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,960
vendor camp if i'm being critical and

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,440
honest about things

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,240
amazon's argument feels more correct to

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,400
me

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,440
they're offering services based on open

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,160
apis

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,919
and open software if you're one of the

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,919
open source vendors

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,120
in one sense you kind of put your

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,440
community

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,560
and the cloud vendors in a united front

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,479
against you

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,160
both the cloud vendors and the users

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,640
want openness and freedom

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,080
in their software and open source

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,800
vendors coming out with community

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,360
licenses

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,240
are basically limiting that freedom open

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,039
source to me

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,560
is ultimately it's about freedom so let

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,560
me talk about

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,480
what developers like about open source

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,640
and why i think open source is really

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,600
about freedom

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,120
so first is the ability you reuse that

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,399
code in new projects

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
if you have permissive open source

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,480
licenses you don't even have to take a

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,240
project wholesale you can just take

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,920
libraries from that project or bits from

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,800
that project that you think are good

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,720
use them in a new project right postgres

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,560
is a great example like the postgres

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,200
parser and different parts of postgres

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,440
code base

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,360
have been used in countless other

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,120
derivative database projects

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,040
some of which have been open some of

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,040
which have been closed in commercial

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,399
uh it's all over the place so i think

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,360
that code reuse

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,880
in other new projects unrelated to the

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,160
original open source project is

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,240
really powerful thing obviously there's

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,040
the ability to fork existing projects

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,800
if you as a user or a developer don't

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,600
like where a project is going or you

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,040
don't like

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,279
what somebody's doing with it or what

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,800
some other vendor is doing with it

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,640
if you have freedom you can fork that

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,519
project you can develop your own version

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,839
of it

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,279
based off that fork you can create

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,120
something new completely

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,080
like derivative works essentially it

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,680
doesn't stop that from happening

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,440
i think the other thing about open

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,640
source projects that i like

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,800
is that the apis are basically open

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,680
and the nice thing is if these things

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,680
become popular

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,279
they become kind of de facto standards

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,279
and that means you can take this with

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,720
you across different cloud vendors

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,240
because you can use the software in

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,519
different cloud vendors

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,519
you can take it with you across

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
different jobs right if

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,760
if open source has wide adoption if a

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,279
project has wide adoption

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,120
there are many many companies that will

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,920
use that software and you can change

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,519
jobs and use that skill set and

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,200
ultimately you can build

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,040
a business or a service for other

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,680
developers to use

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
and it's this last bullet point that i

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,720
think is actually

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,000
more important than anything else by a

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,800
wide margin

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
if people can use software to enrich

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,360
themselves

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,160
it will become much more popular it will

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,959
drive all sorts of activity

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,399
outside of the software in fact this to

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,079
me is the very definition

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,560
of a platform a platform is only that

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,120
if the economic activity that surrounds

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,680
it

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,160
outstrips the value captured by any

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,720
single

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,320
vendor developers like platforms

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
particularly popular ones

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,440
because they can build their careers on

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,480
them their expertise in

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,880
popular in a popular platform translates

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,120
to

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,320
opportunities and better pay and

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,920
basically a more secure life

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,160
so developers demand this kind of

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,600
freedom right

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,120
limiting the freedom means fewer

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,160
developers will build their business on

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,079
your software

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,560
in addition to demanding freedom

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,040
developers demand value convenience

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,600
which is why cloud services based on

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,880
popular

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,720
open source apis get so much traction

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,880
the cloud vendor response to all of this

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,399
has been entirely predictable

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,440
what they what they're going to do is

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,560
they're going to do what their customers

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,399
are asking them to do

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,880
which is provide them with managed

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,720
services based on open apis

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,000
open source sas is basically the

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,240
marriage of

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,680
freedom and convenience and the cloud

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,959
vendors are just going where their

00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,079
customers are telling them to go

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,800
so ultimately infrastructure software is

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,639
becoming

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,800
a commodity and this you know part of

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,760
this is the economics of cloud vendors

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,800
basically cloud vendors make absolutely

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,000
great margins

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,720
on network compute and storage

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,760
it's because they can buy this hardware

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,240
and operate it

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,920
and deploy it at scale so they get it at

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,560
better price they get better economies

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,560
of scale than anybody on the planet

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,399
infrastructure software basically just

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,000
drives more usage for those

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,560
underlying resources i think one example

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,360
of this

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,440
is evidenced by google trying to

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,240
basically commoditize the entire like

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,279
cloud platform api by coming out with

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,360
kubernetes

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,360
open sourcing it and then releasing it

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,279
into a foundation which

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,639
ostensibly they do not control there are

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,639
a bunch of other vendors involved in

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,240
that foundation

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,920
so in response to i think the open

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,639
source vendors having more community

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,880
licenses

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,839
and more restrictive licenses my

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,560
prediction

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,959
is that source available projects will

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,519
have

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,279
significant open source competition in

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,360
the coming years so basically all those

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,120
vendors i was just talking about

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880
those projects will have significant

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,800
open source competitors

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,240
i'd say within the next five years it

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
doesn't mean they won't be continue to

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,959
be successful

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,120
i'm just saying other projects will

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,040
arise and the truth is

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,200
if other developers and other companies

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,959
don't do this

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,959
the cloud vendors will because they'll

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,959
do anything to drive the adoption

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,000
of their underlying compute storage and

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,000
network resources

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,760
so here's how it played out for us

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,480
basically what what we did so in

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,760
2016 uh influx db was basically

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,800
completely open source

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,880
and what we announced was that uh

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,320
future versions would have high

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,360
availability and close

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,800
and and clustering as closed source

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,079
software basically that was going to be

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,600
a commercial offering

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,600
that we would offer that we would have

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
so basically we became an open core

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,399
company

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,639
so we forked the open source project and

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,360
created a commercial version of it

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,160
now this was definitely the right

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,959
decision for us

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,320
at that time we needed a way to turn you

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,920
know the popularity of our open source

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,320
project into a business

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,399
uh which we didn't have at that point

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,560
and that move

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,000
basically created significant like

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,160
commercial uptake

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
right away right so while we basically

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,320
had commercial success

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,680
in those three and a half years but at

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,600
the same time

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,120
i would say there have been more

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
competing projects that have come out

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,279
because

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,639
we've done you know less of our code out

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,040
in the open and

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,360
i think we've ultimately gotten less

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,720
adoption for influx db than we otherwise

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,079
would have had

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,639
so what makes me say we got less

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,320
adoption i mean we have

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,920
hundreds of thousands of influx db

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,279
servers that we know of that are running

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,279
around the world

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,320
and to many people that would sound like

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,160
a very successful

00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,399
open source project however if i'm being

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,880
intellectually honest there's something

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,199
that i would have expected to see

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,079
that hasn't yet happened if influx db

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,519
were really really popular

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,120
and that's how i would have expected to

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,000
see hosted competition

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,880
i would have expected to see aws offer

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,519
influx db

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,399
as a hosted service to their customers

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,320
and then google

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,639
and azure and everybody else to follow

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,279
suit and that we haven't seen that

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,440
largely we as a vendor are the ones who

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,800
are offering hosted influx db

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,759
now there are other bits of the platform

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,720
that the open source

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,600
that the cloud vendors have adopted but

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,399
not the core

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:43,759
of the database itself

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,839
so going to

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,880
the the platform the open source and the

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,839
sas trying to tile these things together

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,160
basically in this new environment i

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,560
think sas is really the only real option

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,560
for

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,399
open source infrastructure vendors

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,320
support subscriptions

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,600
closed source production monitoring

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,519
tooling

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,519
those things are for on-premise

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,800
customers and that business is in

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
structural decline

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,399
and for those who still go with it

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,800
they're likely going to want to

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,600
own and operate those things themselves

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,240
and

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,839
build their own expertise in-house on

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,519
that open source software

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,079
so really like sas i think is the only

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,120
option that you have as a vendor and

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,199
what that means is

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,160
you need to have significant closed

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,959
source software

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,440
in your sas solution that provides you

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,320
with

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,639
some sort of competitive differentiation

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,519
so

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,560
for our part we've spent the last two

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,320
years

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,160
building out an open source cloud

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,360
product this is basically the new

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,680
version of influx db

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,360
version 2.0 it's available in all three

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,040
major clouds

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
however the open source bits are

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,519
actually completely separate

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,199
from the cloud service there are some

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,759
libraries that are shared between the

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,639
two

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,040
but our open source influx db2 project

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,040
is very separate and very different

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,079
from the cloud product that we offer and

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,079
i actually think this is

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,839
less than ideal i think in an ideal

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,000
scenario

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,079
you'd be running your open source bits

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,839
in production

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,600
which means you'd find and fix bugs

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,799
you'd fix performance regressions and

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,559
you make improvements

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,120
and generally you build more build more

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:25,600
reliable open source software over time

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,600
as your sas product matured

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,280
so this is my

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,280
my next prediction which is that i think

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,320
sas infrastructure projects with open

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,799
apis

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,640
and open source exhaust will be the

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,240
future business model of open source

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,840
vendors

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,760
and people with source available

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,039
licenses i do not consider them to be

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,360
open source vendors anymore

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,280
even if they had their roots in open

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,880
source

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,320
and this is how this has already started

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,000
to happen like many people already

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,360
starting to abandon

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,679
the open premise on sorry on-premise

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,880
managed by the customer models what

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,640
they're doing is

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,799
they're creating open source software as

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,400
the exhaust of basically essentially

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,200
creating a sas

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,799
product that they offer and in the

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,360
course of like creating that product

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,720
they

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,160
open source bits of it that they think

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,679
they can open source that other people

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,000
might be able to use

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,200
yet they'd still withhold some sort of

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,600
value in the sas

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,600
offering

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,840
so basically i think it's going to be

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,039
sas first open source

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,240
exhaust after that

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,880
and the open source software will

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,720
basically

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,320
only be valuable to the vendor the open

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,559
source vendor if it drives

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,799
visibility for them and ultimately if it

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,880
drives adoption of their api

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,960
and the api adoption will actually only

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,440
happen if that software is actually open

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,559
source

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,799
but also if the open source thing is

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,799
useful it has to ultimately be useful on

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,799
its own for people to want to adopt it

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,280
so what will the cloud vendors do

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,679
they'll do what their customers are

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,160
asking for right they're going to

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,480
deliver

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,320
managed services based on open source

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,240
and popular apis

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,640
if you don't want them using your source

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,280
code don't open source it

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,720
however if an api is popular enough

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,679
they'll look to offer a competing

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,400
version of it

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,679
even if it's not open source because

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,240
that's what their customers are asking

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,840
for

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,640
so what that means is if you're

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,559
producing an infrastructure tool

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,080
whether you're open source or not you

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,039
almost have to produce it

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,720
for each cloud vendor at least each of

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,440
the major cloud ven

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,240
vendors otherwise you risk having one or

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,880
more of them

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,400
produce the same thing and potentially

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,520
open source it to

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,520
make it a commodity

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,080
so really i guess what the main question

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,840
here is like

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,840
will cloud service providers and open

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,000
source vendors collaborate

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,120
and you know they're already doing this

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,120
at the edges

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,400
so for example we have a data collector

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,840
called telegraph

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,520
it's a very popular open source project

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,320
that we that we make

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,520
and it actually lie it's an entity

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,640
that's kind of separate

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,320
from the other parts of our stack uh

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,320
and we've actually already taken

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,280
contributions and collaborated with

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,600
microsoft

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,320
and we're now working with aws to try

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,880
and bring in

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,400
some of their contributions which

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,799
essentially

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,240
means that telegraph can be used with

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,320
aws even

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,240
in cases where aws is providing a

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,520
competing service to what we're doing

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,280
and the reason we're doing that is

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,600
because we want this

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,520
open source project to be successful and

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,799
we want it to have broad adoption

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,120
because we think that broad adoption

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,760
will be held beneficial you know for

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,640
us in addition to the cloud vendors and

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,799
i think

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,919
kubernetes is kind of like a great

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,840
example of this

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,520
right like all the cloud vendors are

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,240
actually contributing to it

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,600
and i would think i think maybe google

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,799
benefits a bit more because they

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,600
probably have the best

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:06,400
most mature cloud offering of kubernetes

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,640
but they're still collaborating on this

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,159
and

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,919
ultimately i think developers win

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,960
because you get an open api that's

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,400
available across clouds

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,960
so but then the other thing is like if

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,159
your service is driving a bunch of usage

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,960
they may want to partner

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,559
and google and azure in particular seem

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,679
to have been doing this more and more

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,679
with with other vendors but i think aws

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,600
is also doing this as well

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,240
but all of this basically means that you

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,640
have to provide a first-class

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,000
sas service a first-class service on the

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,840
different clouds

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,679
any gaps that you have in your service

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,559
will lead to their users and their

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,240
customers

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,679
asking for those features directly from

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,159
the cloud vendors

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,280
who will be more than happy to deliver

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,400
that software to them

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,400
if enough people are asking

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,200
so for us like i said we've

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,720
spent the last few years developing like

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,039
this sas

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,559
product um and we've also been doing

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,760
open source along the way

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,320
but the core open source database uh

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,960
experience has not evolved as much as

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,400
our cloud platform by far

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,919
so um essentially for our future open

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,679
source development

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,000
we're we're going to try and bend even

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,600
more of it to this strategy so we have a

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,960
new project that we're going to be

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,360
i'm going to be announcing on november

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:32,000
10th but the idea is this new project

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,559
will be open source but we're going to

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,640
offer it

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,480
as a sas product as well now this open

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,200
source project will be dual licensed

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,880
under mit and apache 2 so permissive

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,120
open source license that provides all

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,280
those freedoms i was talking about

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,480
it will be a complete and useful project

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,280
on its own

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,400
uh at least that's what we're hoping for

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,039
um

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,960
but ultimately this project will require

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,640
more code and other

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,799
services and stuff like that if you

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,159
wanted to operate it as a cloud service

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,000
either on your own

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,240
or as a company providing it to

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,120
customers

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,679
and one of the things we did with this

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,520
project

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,000
is we wanted the architecture of the

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,240
software to mirror the business goals

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,080
of the of the the project itself

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,520
so what that means is

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,440
the the software is actually made of

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,120
multiple different pieces one of these

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,000
pieces is open source and some of these

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,799
other pieces

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,640
are closed source and that's by design

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,919
right the separation of concerns is

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
actually part of the

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,640
infrastructure software design but it

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,960
also mirrors the business design

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,919
and one of the things that we really

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,960
wanted was

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,600
we wanted to run the open source bits as

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,200
is in the commercial sas platform so

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,799
what that means is

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,320
those open source bits are actually just

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,760
exhaust like these are things that we

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,320
would have had to build

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,000
build anyway to deliver the sas platform

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,760
that we want to deliver

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,520
and the fact that we can open source

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,520
them is is a bonus

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,120
so what that means is if this new

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,840
project is successful which i would

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,200
expect to take

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,720
time for it to build up that success uh

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,720
i would ultimately expect to see

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,279
competitors adopt that software

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
and use it in their sas products and

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,200
that's by

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,760
design however those competitors will be

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,360
doing it

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,440
probably long after we've already been

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,880
doing it because most people don't want

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,679
to adopt and base their business

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,520
off of a brand new project so they'll

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,360
only be doing it once the software has

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,240
already been proven popular and proven

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,400
successful

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,559
and we've been running a sas product

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,400
behind it for a while

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,400
so let's go back to those other vendors

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,080
is this competition actually harming

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,120
those vendors that were previously open

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,880
source

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,320
right the vast majority of their

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,240
communities were built

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,760
while what they had was essentially pure

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,480
open source software

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,760
right and then some enterprise offerings

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,600
and stuff like that but they still had

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,640
the open source core

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,960
uh but then they got the hosted

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,559
competition through the cloud vendors so

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,000
only two of these companies are publicly

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,760
traded at this point and i use this kind

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,039
of like as a proxy for whether or not

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,480
they've been harmed

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,240
so this is elastic stock price

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,600
since they went public which you can see

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,760
is kind of a roller coaster

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,880
but ultimately like if you had invested

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,679
in the ipo

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,000
uh you know what was this a couple of

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,880
years

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,640
ago you'd be at like 1.8 depending on

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,960
the exact timing of

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,080
when you put in and when you took out so

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,200
not too bad

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,960
uh given just a couple of years so it

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,240
seems that elastic is still continuing

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,440
to thrive

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,240
despite the fact that they're getting

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,600
this competition

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,279
and here's mongodb so there

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,640
obviously their license was hepl

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,080
beforehand and then they switched to

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,400
this new license

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,120
but if you had put money into mongodb

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,320
back

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,919
when they ipo'd was this like three

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,960
short years ago

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,320
you'd be it nearly five times your money

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,600
almost

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,039
so ultimately i think the important

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,600
thing to note about open source

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,720
is that it's not a zero sum game having

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,919
the cloud vendors

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,080
adopt open source and particularly

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,960
use the the project names and use the

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,600
apis

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,400
as part of their services kind of

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
expands

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,000
the size of the community and expands

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,600
the user base

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,440
of that open source software and for

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,840
infrastructure software

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,679
that's really the most important thing

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,520
is that you get that broad adoption so

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,600
the developers can feel comfortable

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,960
building expertise on those things so

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,320
they can then

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,880
go work with that software

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,880
professionally

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:53,840
