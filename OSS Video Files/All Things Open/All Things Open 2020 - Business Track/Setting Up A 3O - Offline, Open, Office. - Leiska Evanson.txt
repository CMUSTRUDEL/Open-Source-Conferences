Abstract: Cloud infrastructure has revolutionised the speed with which companies can spin into existence - but cloud doesn't work well for companies that face infrequent Internet access, foreign exchange strictures or reliability challenges.

In this talk, I will go through a few Open Source projects that can be cobbled together to build a working business infrastructure that can withstand the occasional Internet disconnection.

Some projects featured:

- GnuCash/Beancount
- Libre Office
- Mail-in-a-Box
