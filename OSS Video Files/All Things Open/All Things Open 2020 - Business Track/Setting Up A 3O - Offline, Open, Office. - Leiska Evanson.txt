Abstract: Cloud infrastructure has revolutionised the speed with which companies can spin into existence - but cloud doesn't work well for companies that face infrequent Internet access, foreign exchange strictures or reliability challenges.

In this talk, I will go through a few Open Source projects that can be cobbled together to build a working business infrastructure that can withstand the occasional Internet disconnection.

Some projects featured:

- GnuCash/Beancount
- Libre Office
- Mail-in-a-Box

my name is lisa evanson

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:14,480
and what we're doing in a quick world in

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,960
session is going through building a 3-0

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:24,720
and open offline office

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,720
so since at least 2005

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,000
the tech industry has been pushing us to

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,040
go to the cloud and we've responded

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,680
we've done that many companies are using

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,360
a stack

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,320
that looks a lot like this

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,559
to handle all the back end things that

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,760
you usually don't want to handle

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,199
accounting payroll

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,960
collaboration all the things that

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,719
you don't want to have to think too much

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,239
about

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,559
icloud has been great

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,680
but there are a couple of things it

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,080
doesn't address

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,199
for a number of people in the world such

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,880
as

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,600
lack of access to stable internet

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,640
lack of access to power consistent

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,640
reliable power

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,920
the payment options many times

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,159
cloud options require a credit card

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
and there are a lot of people around the

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,560
world

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,640
that do not have a visa they do not have

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,560
a mastercard

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,000
and there are very few alternate options

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,040
for them to pay for

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
cloud services

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,439
there is still a strong perception of

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,880
inadequate security and inadequate

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,640
privacy with cloud setups

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,079
if you don't want things shared don't

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,119
put it on the internet it's something

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,840
that's been drilled

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,840
in people's heads for quite some time

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,079
and then there's also a sensible lack of

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,960
control

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,360
when things happen to your cloud server

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,560
that's

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,520
thousands of miles away from you

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,399
you can just do things to get back

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,800
access

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:18,400
you can't control what's happening

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,000
and these are concerns for people

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:26,160
who would prefer something more local

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,800
who need flexibility for their office

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,120
and how they use it and more importantly

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:37,680
how they pay for it

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:40,879
and how they customize and control it

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,920
the sort of businesses that i have

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,440
dealt with that look at

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,200
an open offline office a lot of them are

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,080
minimally external facing businesses

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,560
they mainly sell the whole sales they

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,360
don't

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,040
interact with the public that much so a

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,159
lot of farmers

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,879
they're micro or small businesses a

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,000
number of artisans

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,360
or what i call intimate businesses they

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,760
deal with things that

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,080
they don't they want to make sure no one

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,239
else gets access to

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,200
small doctors rural doctors

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,000
a local accountant or a local lawyer a

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,400
little small

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
lawyer

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
so we say we want to build an open

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,879
offline

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,519
office for these people but we need a

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,959
couple of

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,239
tools we need

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,959
i would say primarily

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,360
reading comprehension skills because

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,959
you're gonna spend a lot of time on

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,400
forums

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,799
and reading manuals to get these things

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,599
to work

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,360
of course all around i.t skills

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,400
networking

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,360
hardware you need to

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,799
be able to put together or repair basic

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,680
repairs to a computer

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,879
and setting up a home network in some

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,000
cases a nice

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,400
land network depending on clients needs

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,079
because sometimes they have devices they

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,040
need to connect but they just don't need

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
to get on the internet

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,240
and you know we need patience

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,639
we're starting at 4-3

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,600
for some of these people and it takes

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,080
time to

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,400
get them up and running and often people

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,080
will have the patience

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,639
once they know in the end that they get

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,440
the control and the flexibility

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,560
that they want

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,759
basic things you will need

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,360
still you need some internet access

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,479
it may not even be consistent but you

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,840
need to wait to get some internet access

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
to do these setups

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,759
things you should always consider backup

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,360
power

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:10,160
whether it's the ups or some sort of

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,720
renewable energy set up that can be used

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,880
i am based in barbados so fortunately

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,000
solar is a consideration

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,000
for my clients

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,440
and things to consider is

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,840
if you can't get access to

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,160
where you are are the places where you

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,479
can share access with others

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,360
are there incubators that you can apply

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,280
to

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,280
are there government supported or

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,560
otherwise supported

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,560
business working phases co-hosting

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,440
spaces that you can use

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,320
where you can then set these things up

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,000
or

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,639
get them set up and then take them

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,639
offline

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,560
another consideration for some of these

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,759
people

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,880
is the cost of hardware and even

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,080
getting some of this hardware depending

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,440
on the person's they

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,199
either can't afford it or if you have to

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,199
import it it's going to take

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,960
really long and cost a lot more so

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,240
getting parts getting networking gear

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,440
even we're getting things for repairs of

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,840
all-in-one systems and laptops

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,560
all of these things i found ways around

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,720
by

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,800
going to companies who are sometimes

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,160
they've got depreciated equipment and

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
they need to get it off their

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,000
hands and they are willing to sell it

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,440
either very cheaply or even

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,319
give it away in some cases and depending

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,160
on what your business does

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:53,199
there's also government agencies options

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,400
estate sales thrift shops

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,919
even the odd garage sale

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,080
but the one thing that i would say

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,080
you do spend some cash on

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:12,400
hard drives hard drives

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,639
are paying to repair it

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,240
and it's what everything you're gonna do

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,120
is gonna reside on so

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,160
sometimes it's just best to splurge what

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,240
little money you have

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
on getting a good hard drive

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,240
and this broken laptop this is a okay

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,800
for the sort of people i'm talking about

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,440
laptops actually solve a lot of problems

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,319
because they come with batteries which

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,080
is your

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,400
backup power they can often work with a

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,319
lot of small more portable solar

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,520
chargers and again like i said i'm in

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,639
barbados

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,240
so that's very helpful a broken screen

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,879
is not a problem most of them have a

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,000
video

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,919
out so you can attach it to a monitor

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,240
and you've got your cell phone announced

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,240
to a nice little desktop system in some

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,879
cases

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,599
and they often have the benefit of

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,039
having

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,520
ethernet wi-fi and

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,639
in some laptops you can then put in

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,120
mobile

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,400
data solutions so you can put in the

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,919
same card

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,560
and we fortunately have 4g

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,160
in a number of parts of barbados so

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,160
that's helpful

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
when sometimes nothing else can work

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,879
because you just can't run a cable

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,879
or fiber

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,000
all right so you've gotten your hardware

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,959
what do you do next well next we're

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,320
going into

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,680
repair and assembly so you

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,880
this is where your hardware skills are

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,880
going to come in you're fixing and

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,480
assembling the pc's

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,160
sometimes it might even be a network

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,920
attached storage unit

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,040
which i've seen some people use

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,920
and you're doing any basic networking

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,560
if you have the ability to do that

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,600
networking or you need it

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,720
one of the tools that i have used

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,480
is direct boot and nuke

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,040
now i know i said you should splurge on

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,880
hard drives but the reality is sometimes

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,920
there's just no money for it

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,040
especially for people starting out

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,320
these very small businesses

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,720
so directly is great if you have

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,800
older hard drive and you want to clean

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,920
it off this open source project

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,880
has been around for a long time and

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,839
it is one of the best things to use now

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,839
i don't think

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:41,040
the open source non-enterprise

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,920
version handles

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
solid-state drives but in most cases if

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,040
you're going to be

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,839
using older hardware you're probably

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,959
getting a

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,959
normal hard disk drive

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,480
step 2 installing the operating system

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,519
so now we're looking at ubuntu linux

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
which i have found

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,600
has been the most comfortable

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,040
for people to use

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,040
after setup and you've got desktop and

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,240
server options

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,200
you can download this just like um

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
d-band that i spoke about before what

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
you would do

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,600
is you put these on a usb or

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,000
burn it to a cd depending on the age of

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,519
the hardware that you're using

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,920
and plug them in boot up the hardware

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,120
and install it from there running and

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,800
then installing

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,760
ubuntu now you have the desktop and

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,200
server versions

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,440
and for all the hardware you may only be

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,440
able to use up to i believe version

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,440
18.04

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:58,160
in step three you're installing software

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,640
now that you've got the computers up and

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,640
running

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,640
with operating system on it and a nice

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,959
clean hard drive

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:10,560
we are looking at two main packages

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:14,399
libreoffice and new cache

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,120
both of these have been open source

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,399
projects that have been long running

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,240
well supported

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,440
so well supported i think it's the 10th

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,360
anniversary of libra office actually

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,079
and they offer great interoperability

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,240
with a lot of what already exists so

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,360
libra office can handle

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,519
most microsoft office documents that

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,880
come across your way

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,600
new cache can handle qif files

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,880
and imports that you make csvs you might

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
be importing from your

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
bank account

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,920
best thing about new cash though is that

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,920
it does

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,240
invoicing and billing you can set up a

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,120
basic invoice and billing through a new

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,760
cash

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,959
and check for the team now check for

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,639
anything might seem to be something that

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,920
should be obsolete but there's still a

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,200
lot of places

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,040
where a check offers you

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,839
their best flexibility and that sort of

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,839
cash can help

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,920
another little project that i have also

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,040
used

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:28,880
is being count which is that you

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:32,480
github.io it's managed by martin blaze

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,760
and it's a python package so you can't

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,800
install it with pip or you can just do a

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,839
git chrome

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,959
of the package it also has a web

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,600
interface called fablab

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,680
so this is the web interface the example

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,120
web interface that we're looking at

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,480
this creates a plain text general

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,880
lecture

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,920
so you are saving your accounting

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,240
information

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,600
in a particular syntax which is very

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,040
easy to learn

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,360
and it's plain text

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,240
it's no heavy enough no heavy files or

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,800
anything like that

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,240
and that's great when you're offline you

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
can just put it on there the web

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,720
interface

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,160
it starts up a little local web server

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,399
and you're just going to local host

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,320
and pulling up the web interface and

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,800
using it that way if you don't want to

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,600
edit your text files

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,519
and as you can see it provides a lot of

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,720
ways for you to look at your financial

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,480
information

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,560
and it allows customization so

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,959
one of the things with cloud items is

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,959
that they still have a lot of

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,079
templates they go by it can be hard to

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,720
customize

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,680
for certain industries especially

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,199
outside

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,480
of the normal regions of college

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,279
use with usck europe

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,720
so this allows people to customize their

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,440
general ledgers

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,440
as they need

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,760
and so you might say okay this is the

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,120
basic home office setup

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,760
for uh open source offline office

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,760
complete

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
except we kind of forgot about email

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,760
especially for those

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,079
intimate businesses that i spoke about

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:25,199
using the normal gmail package

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,320
using even

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,760
microsoft email

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,880
that doesn't work for them because

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,760
you don't want anything at all

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,399
really reading it but email is also

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,440
really hard to set up

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,360
we're going into a black hole here

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:52,079
just aside from the amount of storage

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,079
that email usually requires

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,560
we're looking at security we're looking

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
at

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,839
networking now because you are talking

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,279
about

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:08,800
how to set up your network to avoid

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,920
breaks in the internet in my case in

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,440
barbados we

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,560
are an island so we have two

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,519
off island waste

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,920
to the general internet by any point in

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,000
time

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,279
a ship can come along or an earthquake

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,519
can happen

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:30,720
and those two cable seat cables are cut

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:36,000
and we will only have a network

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,839
on the non-island wide area network

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
you're dealing with in some cases user

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,240
management

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,920
if it's not just you maybe you have a

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,160
partner maybe you have

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,120
a few more people now you've got to deal

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,480
with user management

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,680
and i can tell you right now the

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,040
package i'm going to suggest

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,839
we will not be using it as intended

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,920
it has a specific use but we will not be

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,519
using it as intended but it's still

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,480
really great if you are going to take

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,759
that time

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,040
and so that package which sets up your

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:19,440
mail server web server file

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,880
server collaboration with security

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,000
is is a terrific package done by joshua

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,720
tauber

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,680
who is also one of the founders and

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,040
co-creators

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:35,519
of govtrack.us

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,639
this package is mail in a box.email

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,399
so it installs all these things next

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,360
cloud which is your file server

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,880
collaboration

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,079
server your calendar your contact

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,199
management

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,399
engine next so you have a basic web

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,000
server

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,040
round cube so you can just pull up your

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,320
web you don't need to

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,040
have a client you can just use your web

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,320
browser

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,680
to get to your email post fix that again

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,319
that's a mail server

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,079
let's encrypt it also installs a few

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,240
other things i think it includes

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,240
fail too bad as well

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,760
and all it is is a batch script

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,199
so you're just typing in one line it's a

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,199
bash script

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,880
and it works now caveat this is ubuntu

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,720
specific

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,440
right now so and i think it's again up

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,559
to 18.

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,919
hey hi less car uh sorry for

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,679
interruption

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,240
sorry for interrupting you have like

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,039
your one minute over time so if you

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,160
could like just round up in one minute

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
that would be very great

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,840
well i'm i'm about to finish up so about

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,960
one minute

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,360
okay thank you very much

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,160
thank you so and that that is the

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,840
advanced

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,160
home office completed because now you

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,160
have

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,039
your libreoffice new cash or b

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,559
account and you have your email set up

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,760
so now you're complete right

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,480
oh not quite and i'll tell you why

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,440
because just as ari said in her talk

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,919
before

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,039
you've got to look for ways to give back

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,760
to the open source community

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,840
we're using these products every day we

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,240
have a responsibility

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,440
to give back whether it's by giving a 10

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,280
minute talk

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,720
on some iffy connections

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,559
on what you use and why or

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,240
helping with code or just giving

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,039
feedback to the developers so they can

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,039
make it better

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,679
