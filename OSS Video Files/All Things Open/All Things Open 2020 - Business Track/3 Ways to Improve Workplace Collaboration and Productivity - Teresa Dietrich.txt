	00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,200
so welcome everybody

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,880
um uh as we said we're going to talk

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,080
about how to improve workplace

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,360
collaboration and

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,720
uh and transparency um let me first

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,039
introduce myself

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,119
um i am the chief product and technology

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,519
officer at stack overflow

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,760
i manage a team that spans nearly every

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,920
time zone across america's in europe

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,199
it was already 80 remote before the

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,960
pandemic hit and is obviously now 100

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,640
remote um so uh that's

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,480
that fortunately for us we haven't had

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,360
too much of a change uh

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,920
in the work habits but we have had it in

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,480
um

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,840
in with regards to what everyone's

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,719
dealing with

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
um so i've had over 20 years in the tech

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,800
industry

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,920
i started at aol uh in the 90s and

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,160
i have bel spent time at webmd

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,680
namely and just before stack overflow

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,520
which i joined in january

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,320
before that i was at mckenzie new

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,080
ventures working on a product incubator

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,080
outside of technology my biggest

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,360
passions are probably traveling and

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,880
reading

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,560
obviously none of us are doing a lot of

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,479
traveling right now so

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,240
definitely been picking up the pace on

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,880
uh on reading

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,520
a lot of sci-fi and fantasy to uh to

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,200
sort of

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,360
a bit of escape okay so let's dig into

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,119
what we're gonna talk about today

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,200
i'm talking about the true cost of

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,040
distractions in the workplace

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
and how you can improve collaboration

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
and productivity

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,119
while being aware and cautious of the

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,920
impacts of interruptions

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,640
so at the end of the talk today you'll

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,799
you'll know

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,960
the impact of destruct destruction such

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,479
as email chat pings and impromptu

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,880
meetings

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,880
recommendations for reducing distraction

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,759
and driving productivity

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,079
and three ways to improve company-wide

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,640
or

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,079
team-wide collaboration that both

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,079
individual contributors

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,079
and managers can implement

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,439
so first focus is your most valuable

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,599
resource

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,680
let's talk about the underlying problems

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,440
of distractions

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,680
you know the technology that keeps us

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,879
all connected has been around for over

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
20 years now right

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,640
instant messaging started uh over 20

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,879
years ago

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,160
but it's grown more mature as any

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,879
industry matures

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,160
it helps you solve the easy problems and

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,560
creates efficient

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,040
industry standard solutions that improve

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,599
productivity for everyone

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,120
that leaves the hard problems to solve

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,280
the big breakthroughs

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,160
innovations that create the next set of

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,160
opportunities for us all to work with

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,080
and growing into a mature space means

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,840
tackling the hard problems that no one's

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,640
been able to solve

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,000
and as you well know solving those hard

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,840
problems requires real

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,959
focus right uh sustained focus

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,480
and real attention and the space and

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,480
freedom to focus

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,840
is what i believe your company's most

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
valuable resource

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,319
focus is being stolen from all of us

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,239
every day

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,440
your technology experts and other

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,599
knowledge workers need

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,879
uninterrupted focus in order to enter

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,720
flow states

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,480
which is the mindset in which they bring

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,840
their full suite of skills and

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,879
experience

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
to bear on the issue as described in the

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,840
book

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,120
flow the psychology of optimal

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,040
experience

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,159
by me high cheek sent me high

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,879
being in this zone this flow zone allows

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,040
one to become

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,599
fully engaged and focus on the task at

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,440
hand it leads to better results

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,000
and greater greater happiness for the

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,159
individuals but it can only actually

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
happen when you have the opportunity to

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,360
fully focus

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,360
on whatever lies before you

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,680
47 47 is the number of times the average

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,239
person is likely to check

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,239
his or her smartphone today according to

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,799
deloitte's global mobile serv

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,239
consumer survey you know i think it's

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,920
interesting i'll be really interested to

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,239
see more data comes out

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,200
after the pandemic because i wonder if

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,199
we're on the screen

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,359
the big screen more and the small screen

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,199
less but we're still getting

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,639
uh plenty of uh pings and and whatnot

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,320
to pull your attention away from

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,639
whatever you're on

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,720
and just like our phone our chat and

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,639
messaging platforms at work

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,960
they're all taking away employees

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,280
valuable time and attention

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,280
and interestingly enough is there's

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,240
actually a biological incentive

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,240
that only makes this worse for us you

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,639
actually get a dopamine reward

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,040
cycle of constantly checking those

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
messages or notifications and responding

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,000
to them

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
right i think it comes from a sense of

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,199
like doing something we all have a

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,040
million things to do but

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,720
checking that message or looking at that

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,080
notification feels like you've

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,479
accomplished something

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,280
even if reality it's not actually

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,639
anything

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:11,039
valuable that's a priority for you

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:14,880
so think about that

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,560
six hours lost a day okay this is real

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,560
um there's actually a great i think

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,919
there's a new york times article

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,680
uh that highlights this um but another

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,840
you know another common disruption for

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,280
those in the office can simply be a tap

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
on the shoulder

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,639
for technologists they're thinking of a

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,160
whole lot of things at once solving

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,560
problems that require a deep

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,880
understanding of the whole system the

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
specific situation they're dealing with

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,440
and they're trying to keep lots of

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,440
information in their brains all at once

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,800
and a simple real tap or a virtual tap

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,520
right in the middle of their thinking

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,080
process can be disastrous

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,479
these pings ding shoulder taps have a

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,000
measured impact on your productivity

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,000
research from the university of

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,120
california and holdenbelt university

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,759
found that

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,639
workers can lose up to 23 minutes on a

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,039
task

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,720
when they are interrupted and

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,039
researchers at uc irvine

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
observed office workers in their natural

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,160
habitat

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
uh and found that on average they

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,360
switched tasks or interrupted about

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,199
every three minutes okay so if you're

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,199
interrupted about every three minutes

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,319
and on top of that it could take you up

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,919
to 20 minutes

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,000
to get back to where you were when you

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,720
were interrupted they could cost

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,840
individuals up to six hours every day

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,560
that's crazy

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
uh when i first read this i was just in

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,319
sort of disbelief but they

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,199
they put out the numbers and and show

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,400
you how how to get there

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,360
okay so uh this is a great

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,960
uh cartoon about why you shouldn't

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
interrupt a programmer

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,800
um and i think it sort of is a a great

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,199
visual demonstration of what we

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,000
mentioned before what i mentioned before

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,080
which is about like how deep into the

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,840
rabbit hole or how deep into problem

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,520
solving they are

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,599
and what happens when you then have to

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,360
go and um

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,960
you know they have to go back and start

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,440
all over again at the very beginning

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,840
here

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,520
right um so i thought i thought you

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,319
might enjoy that uh that visual

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,319
representation

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,520
so you and your employees feel all these

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,120
distractions and these interruptions

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,800
all these interruptions lead to greater

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
stress and anxiety

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,639
depending on the task productivity may

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,639
not suffer

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,240
but interruptions may actually cause us

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,639
to work faster

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,479
right so we feel more stressed we're

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,639
under greater time pressure

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,000
uh we feel frustrated that we never feel

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
like we're actually getting

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,520
the things that we want to get done

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,520
completed

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,360
it takes more time more effort to

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,440
complete the same amount of work with

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,560
interruptions in the mix

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,400
in the longer term uh enduring

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,000
uh regular interruptions which can be up

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
to 85 a day

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,479
can definitely cause decreased job

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,319
satisfaction and burnout

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,240
and i think a lot of us are feeling that

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,479
right now even if we're not in person

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,840
knowledge workers who are interrupted in

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,479
a counterproductive manner

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,599
are significantly more stress they have

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,400
higher levels of stress

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,720
frustration mental effort feelings of

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,479
time pressure and mental workload

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
and that's from a fast company article

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,199
if you want to dig in

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,120
a little bit more stress and anxiety

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,560
form a feedback loop which can cause

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,759
attentional problems

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,360
like difficulty concentrating right

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,039
without the ability to focus on what

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,599
you're working on you may forget

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,800
steps or not remember solutions you've

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,919
already found

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,640
right anxiety has been linked to memory

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,240
lapses

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,240
and if you're constantly forgetting the

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,640
information you're received

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,320
from chat messages that interrupt people

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,160
you may end up having to interrupt them

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,200
over and over again to try and get that

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,959
answer again

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,320
you also may be more likely through

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,120
skipping steps

00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,720
and actually cause problems just because

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,720
you're so distracted and stressed

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,480
and companies keep giving us more

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,240
opportunities for distraction

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,800
right instant messaging video

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
chats have raised significant amounts of

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
capital

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,920
as recently as investors expect the

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,040
number of employees working outside our

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,800
main offices

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,800
will be sustained or continue to rise

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,240
last year zoom and slack went public

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,600
which reinforced the view

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,760
that the market for business

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,480
communication is growing

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,000
data provided by pitch book data inc

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
shows that in each of the last four

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,839
years there are more than 100 financing

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,720
rounds

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,000
specifically on the enterprise

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,760
communication software business

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,279
enterprise collaboration as well as

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,640
communication software

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,959
continue to go at a rapid pace the chart

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,640
shows investments in 2017

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:57,360
at 3.3 2018 at 5.7

00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:01,120
and 2019 at 6.2 billion

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,519
okay so now we know what's happening

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,440
and is unlikely to change anytime soon

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,880
so how do we balance

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,920
uh the continued increase in disruptions

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,720
and software that

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,399
tries to pull our attention away well we

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,680
know that the need for collaboration and

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,320
meaningful communication

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,240
is required for teams and for the whole

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,880
organization to be successful

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,120
and especially with remote work how do

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,200
we balance it all

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,279
the promising market the investment for

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
tools and the flexibility to work just

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,440
about anywhere

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,040
is where we actually are today uh in

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
fact stack overflow as i mentioned

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,560
before

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,680
started as a remote work uh

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,079
culture uh and before this 50

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,320
of our uh the whole company and like i

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,399
said over 80 percent of uh

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,560
the engineering and product organization

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,839
were working from their home office

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,640
or in various places all over the world

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,480
um and it allows uh companies who have

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,959
this remote work culture to attract and

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,800
retain talent regardless of where their

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,800
geographic region is

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,760
and with these with the right tools we

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,959
can help communication and connectivity

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,480
however we're seeing all these

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,480
interruptions left and right

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,320
so let's look at the problem a different

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,880
way what really makes us miserable

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,560
is actually uh what makes us miserable

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,040
about these constant interruptions

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,920
is it actually destroys our control

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,640
right

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,320
our focus is no longer under our control

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,480
or our command

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,800
instead it ends up being at the mercy of

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,480
notification on top of notification on

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,079
top of notification

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,440
multiple applications chiming crying out

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,360
for our attention

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,040
and ringing wrangling them under your

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,519
control seems to be at the root of the

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,440
solution

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,360
our always-on culture means that work

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,639
contacts don't stay within the bounds of

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
the workplace

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,360
or the work time zones especially in a

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,600
remote and work from home situation it

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,839
becomes all too easy to answer slacker

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,279
emails after hours right so we're all in

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,360
meetings all day

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,600
and when we actually get the time to

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,240
focus and provide answers

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
we're now creating notifications to our

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,320
colleagues

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,040
um to and they feel uh

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,880
that they have to respond right so

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,560
freeing up just what's supposed to be

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,240
your free time

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,079
is um is like the very least the

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,240
bare minimum that we feel like we we

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,320
need to be able to do

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,920
so how can organizations offer industry

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,839
leading tools and technology

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,360
to improve collaboration while keeping

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,680
employees productive

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,839
and try and remove as much stress as we

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,839
can

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,880
so how do we fix it by giving your

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,680
employees or yourself

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,800
the ability to recover some measure of

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,639
control

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,480
over the focus of their week right

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,839
so first i'll cover some ways to

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
guarantee you and your two

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,920
teammates can get work done to drive

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,519
business results

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,000
there's a couple i'd like to highlight

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,639
for you agree on universal do not

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,800
disturb hours block out time that you

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,200
and your teammates are not available

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,000
and share these with key groups you work

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,560
with

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,959
this usually works best from the bottom

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,200
up who are the teams that work together

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,560
with their time zones and other sort of

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,440
constraints

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,240
how can they um how can they work

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,079
together

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,760
and create something that they can agree

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,800
on and then socialize it

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,600
with other key groups they work with

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,000
another item that i believe can really

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,959
help

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,959
is picking one must-do item for yourself

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,760
and sharing it with your teammates

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,920
right picking one and this isn't like a

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,440
small item on your to-do list but a real

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,279
focus for the week

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,639
one problem that you're really trying to

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,600
solve uh

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,560
and make progress on um it may be

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,199
uncomfortable

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,560
to try and pick just one but it helps

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,560
keep you focused

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,760
if you constantly get distracted you can

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,160
say is this

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,360
does this contribute to my must do item

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,680
for this week

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,000
uh we've also i've also recommended

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,600
posting this as your slack notification

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,040
so not only are you holding yourself

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,079
accountable but you can ask your

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,920
teammates

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,519
to help hold you accountable for this

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,519
maybe it's on your calendar

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,600
or any other tool that you have to

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,320
really socialize and put this out to the

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,680
rest of

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,199
your colleagues and teammates and lastly

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,240
know the end goal

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,079
it's really important for you to to in

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,800
your team to be focused

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,920
on what are the kpis or business goals

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,440
or outcome

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,320
for the project that you're all working

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,160
on together if something distracts you

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
again in holding each other and yourself

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,399
accountable you can say does

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,120
does this work help get us to the end

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,160
goal

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,160
if not you work to de-prioritize it

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,680
second i want to focus on building a

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,360
collaborative culture

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,279
we know the benefits from collaboration

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,639
are significant right but what are the

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,240
actual risks if you don't have a

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,920
collaborative culture

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,560
according to the project management

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,800
institute 57

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,959
of failed projects have to do with

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,360
ineffective communication

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:18,959
that's a lot right 57 of failed projects

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,680
one of the major uh contributors to the

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,320
failure

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,680
was ineffective communication so by

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,800
building a collaborative

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,880
culture everyone benefits

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,079
everyone feels like their work matters

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,199
they have meaning

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,560
and they have purpose deloitte's may

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,360
2020 article

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,959
belonging from comfort to connection to

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,720
contribution

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,079
states that people are looking for work

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,160
to give them a sense of personal

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,639
fulfillment and satisfaction

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,839
and these things are driven from a sense

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,440
of uh

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,399
wanting to belong belonging encompasses

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,759
feeling

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,399
feeling comfortable at work which means

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,639
being

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,000
treated fairly and being respected by

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,160
others

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,519
feeling connected to their teammates and

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,920
their colleagues

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360
and that their contributions are values

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,199
seeing how are valued

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,440
seeing how their strengths are helping

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,279
the organization achieve

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,160
bigger common goals belonging leads to

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,079
collaboration and collaboration leads to

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,959
a higher chance of success

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,880
because people are comfortable connected

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:29,199
and have real obvious ways that their

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,199
contributions are valued and have impact

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,279
so what are the roles or what are the

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,560
steps that we can take

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:40,000
to get there first

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,040
have clarity around rules responsibility

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and mission having everyone on the same

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,800
page

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,759
about roles or who does what on a

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,160
project

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,279
can help avoid communication pitfalls

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,560
and and

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,160
failed projects clarity around the roles

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,199
and the responsibilities

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,000
helps minimize constant questions

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,120
or impromptu meetings to determine who

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,760
owns something

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,959
or who's uh who's got it first who's

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,120
handing it off

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,720
or to have to impromptu develop a

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,199
one-off process

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,760
for that specif specific project to help

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,559
get things

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,240
moving again ensuring there's little

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,400
overlap

00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,319
responsibilities a clear process

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,480
and the ultimate goal or what i like to

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,199
call success criteria

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,880
is really important so then how does

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,320
this ladder up to the larger

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,160
organization

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,120
well you need to have a set of strategic

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,760
initiatives across your organization

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,000
to help enforce clarity for example at

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,760
stack overflow we have five strategic

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,760
initiatives or goals we set out for 2020

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,760
and we literally just had a uh the

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,000
beginning of a company-wide meetup

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,400
where we actually started with the five

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,559
new strategic initiatives for next year

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,600
that helps us go into planning

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,559
and coming up with what are the um what

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,000
are the specific

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,960
projects road maps that all come back

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,080
to those uh strategic initiatives and

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,120
the business outcomes

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,120
associated with them

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,200
so next we talk about buy-in and

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,440
psychological safety

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,520
everyone this comes back to control

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,559
right everyone wants autonomy in their

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,480
role

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,840
they want to have control over how they

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,039
work

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,360
they want to feel like they have the

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,000
ability to speak up when they have new

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,320
ideas

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,400
or innovative solutions to bring to the

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,480
table

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,840
we need to ensure employees feel trust

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,080
and confidence to build the

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,200
psychological safety they need

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,000
to express new ideas suggest new ways of

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,000
thinking

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,320
and to build the relationships they need

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,320
to solve the complex problems we're all

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,799
facing every day

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,000
a safe environment in which an employee

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,320
can speak up

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,799
with their ideas or solutions leads to

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,840
more productive collaboration time

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,520
this results into less one-on-one or

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,880
intimate brainstorming session that can

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,360
eat into your day

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,960
or your working blocks it allows people

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,600
to compose their thoughts or ideas

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,160
before they present them without fear of

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,720
interruption or immediate challenge

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,720
and it also allows uh us to have more

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,240
asynchronous collaboration

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,720
we all know that in person live is not

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,240
the only way to collaborate

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,360
research from google showed that a

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,679
well-organized team that collaborated

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,559
and an individual and had individuals on

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,440
the team who felt psychologically safe

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,679
were much more productive and impactful

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,120
it reduces the possibility of leaving

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,799
the company reduces the possibility of

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,760
the individuals on the team leaving the

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,679
company

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,799
increases the likelihood of using

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,919
diverse ideas or solutions

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,919
it helps bring in more revenue and the

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,840
teams tend to be twice as effective as

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,080
others and actually getting their job

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,080
done

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,559
equip employees with just the right

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,919
amount of information

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,760
um i think i think as a someone in a

00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,720
manager or leadership role

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,080
you know that right um employees can

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,480
only take so much

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,400
information as well as interruption and

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,799
we already know what the cost of disrupt

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,280
distraction is people need to work

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,320
longer periods of uninterrupted time

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,159
to do their best work so as a leader or

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,360
manager what you really want to do is

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,400
make sure that people have

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,520
the right amount of information to

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,520
uh and to to do the role that they need

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,880
to to give them that autonomy and that

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,640
control

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,039
um but not so much that they're

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,799
overwhelmed and they can't sort through

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,240
all the information they have to try and

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,200
get the information that's really

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,120
relevant

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,840
to the project or the problem that

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
they're working on

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,559
so how can we implement these ideas

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,159
as you know if you're an individual

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,080
contributor

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,120
well you know clarity around roles

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,720
responsibilities and missions ask for it

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,039
ask for clarity offer clarity to others

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,039
start having conversations right i think

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,480
it's really important when you

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,240
start a new team or when you start to um

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,799
maybe you have growth and you have to

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,159
split into smaller teams like in product

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,280
development roles

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,960
and you need to clearly carve out what

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,360
that team has ownership for

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,679
what they're responsible for what kind

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,240
of decisions they have autonomy to make

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,520
within the team without having to go

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,919
up or outside to get buy-in

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,720
um and i think that's really important

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,520
right

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,280
um and so you know you can start even as

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,559
an individual within your team here's

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,960
what i'm focused on

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,679
right what are you focusing on start

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,760
small

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,159
but you can extend that from yourself

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,159
within the team for your team with with

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,360
other sort of adjacent teams

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,280
to try and establish that

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,360
um and i think it's really important at

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,799
the end of meetings or collaboration

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,840
sessions that you sort of really clarify

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,360
ownership and next steps right so

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,559
beth you're taking on you know the first

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,000
action item you know

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,520
when are you going to come back to us

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,960
with an update or when do you think

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,919
you're going to be finished

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,840
just asking those questions helps um

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,280
create more clarity around others which

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,799
means you don't have to have lots of

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,039
follow-up sessions

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,600
or interruptions to try and get that

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,080
information after the fact

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,760
buy-in and psychological safety agree

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,240
with your teammates that you'll all be

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,320
open to each other's ideas

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,280
give each other the space and time to

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,919
compose their

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,720
thoughts or responses and it benefits

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,440
everyone

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,520
not just a few individuals we all think

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
differently we all work and communicate

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,039
differently

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,960
and so you know agreeing you know to be

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,640
that we're assuming best intent

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,799
agreeing that if someone asks for a

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,360
little more time or space to give it to

00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,679
them

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,400
is really important in sort of that

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,960
creating that psychological safety

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,720
you know at a call out on a document at

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,360
the start of the meeting or within a

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,400
discussion

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,679
thread right that says very openly and

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,720
very clearly

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,679
collaboration space all ideas

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,440
thoughts and perspectives are welcome

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,559
you can also establish a

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,280
tone for written uh communication so

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,440
there's

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,200
one person here uh that i work with a

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,760
lot at stack overflow

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,760
and uh she calls out whether it's

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,240
verbally or in a document

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,880
that she's gonna poke at someone's uh

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,320
idea

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,919
when she's going to challenge them in a

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,279
constructive way

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,559
her calling out that poke uh is meant to

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,960
be an indicator that there's no

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,440
malicious attempt in her challenge

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,520
she's just trying to open up to discuss

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,799
around the idea to understand

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,799
you know any the strikes or any gaps or

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,919
weaknesses in it so that everyone really

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,480
understands it

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,919
and that we've really explored uh any

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,279
idea to make sure that

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:07,760
we're that everyone's on the same page

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:10,000
so to recap there's real productivity

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,919
cost to losing focus and it's a major

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,120
impact to everyone's well-being

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,120
and our level of stress you can protect

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,840
your team's focus on a daily basis

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,960
by agreeing to universal do not disturb

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,200
hours

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,400
picking one must do a week and sharing

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,000
it widely

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,000
and making sure that everyone on the

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,799
team knows what the end goal they know

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,279
what success

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,520
looks like and you can implement

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,559
company-wide or team-wide approaches for

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,679
focusing on

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,679
uh for improving focus and collaboration

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,600
such as clarity around roles and

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,080
responsibilities

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,080
buy-in and psychological safety for your

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,480
team and work environment

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,840
and making sure that members of the team

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,760
have just the right amount of

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,320
information to be able to

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,279
have autonomy but not so much that

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,279
they're overloaded

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,799
so that's that's the talk uh i'm happy

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,440
to take questions i think we have some

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,320
time

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,200
i'm happy to take questions uh if uh if

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,440
you have any

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,080
or um want to reach out uh

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,919
asynchronously as well

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,159
yeah thank you theresa i think there are

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,159
some questions on the q a

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,240
do you want to look at them or i should

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,600
read them all

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,520
uh if you want to read them to me that

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,840
would be great

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,960
okay fine so uh the first question is

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,559
did much of your research come across

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,080
uh and um you may have touched on this

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,919
step away so okay do most of your

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,760
research come across meetings

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,159
versus should have been an email

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,000
yeah i think um we didn't focus on it

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,360
when we were doing the research for

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,120
uh for this specific talk but um

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,039
you know it's something that you know in

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,320
multiple organizations that i've joined

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,720
before uh

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,320
one of the sort of conversations that we

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,520
often have

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,720
is um you know what i call meeting

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,559
culture

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,480
and i think it's you know it comes back

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,679
to the larger distraction

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,919
right that we keep talking about um

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,200
but you know what i i think you know

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,080
what's really important is

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,880
is to come up with a meeting culture

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,120
right

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,279
and that can be everywhere from like you

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,640
know uh i once did one that was sort of

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,279
a decision flow chart

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,120
right what are you trying to accomplish

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,760
are you trying to get everyone on the

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,159
same page are you trying to inform them

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,840
are you trying to make a decision right

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,880
are you trying to get a group of people

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,919
to commit

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,400
to a plan right and then as a result of

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,240
that

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,760
you have suggestions about what you

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,000
should do um

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,360
like how like okay now you know what

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,120
your end goal is

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,559
and how should you how should you put

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,600
together a plan

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,360
you know to optimize for people's time

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,720
and also to make sure when you have a

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,320
meeting they're really engaged that

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,159
people come prepared

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,799
right so should there be agenda

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,240
beforehand should there be pre-work

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,000
rather than the pre-work actually

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,240
happening live in the meeting

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,440
where not everyone needs to be there for

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,760
it

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,559
and so i think there's a lot of things

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,520
that we can do

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,960
but i really like you know helping in

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,480
helping to answer that you know i think

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,440
we've all seen that like we've all

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,880
talked about

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,399
you know walking away from meetings that

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,679
we all were like yep should have been an

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,320
email

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,279
um and so i think thinking about it from

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,880
a larger standpoint of like what is our

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,360
team organization or company um

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,120
meeting culture and what like what are

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,080
the questions that someone should ask

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,480
themselves

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,720
to decide should this be an email should

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,039
this be a collaboration document

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,960
you know um should this be should this

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,240
be a meeting should this be a series of

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,159
meetings

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,320
i think is really important and i think

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,559
it's really important to

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,480
develop that meeting culture together

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,720
one so that people understand it

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,840
different points of view are reflected

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,480
and folks feel

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,039
ownership and therefore hold each other

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,159
to

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,159
whatever you agree to

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,919
okay thanks for the answer there sir so

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,960
um the next question

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,240
from rika she says um the largest

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,120
destruction

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,840
um when working in the office is the

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,200
open

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,880
open workspace the visual distractions

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,600
are nearly constant

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,159
i can't turn off or limit the people

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:36,080
sitting or working near my decks

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:40,080
how do you suggest we focus and produce

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,919
in these open work space environments

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,000
i think it's a huge challenge and you

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,840
know i have lots of

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,039
friends and colleagues in the tech

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,279
leadership space

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,279
and we talk about it all the time right

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,760
there's all these articles written why

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,240
open workspace is not ideal

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,200
uh it's not ideal for for this focus and

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,520
everything

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,840
uh and i i'd make a couple comments here

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,080
one i think at the very least

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,080
you know noise-cancelling headphones

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,360
putting on bigger headphones

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,279
um what i've seen is it's a real visual

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,720
indicator to folks that you're focused

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,440
and a bit heads down

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,000
and i've seen people be more reluctant

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,440
to come

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,320
in and um and and sort of do the tap on

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,000
the shoulder

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,559
uh to try and interrupt you um i've seen

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,640
folks use sort of like uh

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,159
some sort of visual indicator maybe

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,720
different colored cards

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,799
that they put up uh to sort of show when

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,640
they're sort of heads down in the work

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,960
versus like you know maybe just

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,600
answering emails or chatting or doing

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,880
something

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,360
that's more disruption friendly

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,559
but but overall what i'd say is i'm

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,360
really interested

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,159
right i think in the tech space a lot of

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,520
companies

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,159
are looking at going you know

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,360
virtual more more remote sort of

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,240
permanent

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,000
or um much more supportive of remote

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,600
work environments

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,240
uh and um and

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,760
i'm really interested to see what's

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,200
going to happen

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,360
for workplace environments like how it's

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,880
going to evolve as we start to maybe

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,600
start to tear out cubicles and

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,720
and rearrange these to add more flex

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,600
spaces

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,240
uh and whatnot and my hope is that maybe

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,480
some of the sort of

00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,679
ingrained like we always have cubicles

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,640
and everything

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,480
um could really be helpful i think you

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,360
know the visual distractions

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,760
uh higher cubicles are better to try and

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,960
not

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,320
have that um to rebecca's comment on

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,840
there as you can see them

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,279
right you can you can see them out of

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,799
the corner of your eye or you can see

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,559
them making eye contact

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:55,279
eye contact down the down the uh row

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,919
um and you know all i can say is i

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,799
really do

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,799
hope that as a result of what's going on

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,399
with you know the pandemic and so many

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,399
people working remotely

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,720
is we start to really rethink office

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,720
space

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,240
thanks for the answer teresa so um the

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,720
next one is

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,640
so two persons are asking um where if

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,360
you could share your slides or if they

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,480
link where they can assess your slides

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,559
yep so

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,120
i'll work with my team and figure out

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,480
how we can share those with you all

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,600
okay so um the next question from troy

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,399
how do you establish universal d

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,080
and d when different time zones are

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,320
present

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,279
yeah i think you know like i said in in

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,200
the talk

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,480
um i think it has to be from the ground

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,679
up right so we have

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,640
teams that have um

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,640
uh various time zones right spread

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,519
across within a scrum team

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,360
and so you know the answer may be that

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,840
you agree you know if you really do have

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,880
a wide breadth of time zones the answer

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,120
may be

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,799
okay you actually sort of do the inverse

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,080
which is you sort of say

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,159
these are the times that we're going to

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,679
be available to each other where we have

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,120
the most overlap

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,000
and then individuals on the team then

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,840
say okay if

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,440
those are the three or four hours that

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,320
we're really reserving

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,039
to have meetings and collaboration and

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,760
whatnot

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,559
now outside of those three or four hours

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,559
where can i

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:30,799
create my own do not disturb um

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,919
you know hours for myself right and

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,320
advertise those

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,320
out um i think what's important with the

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,679
dnd is sort of how do you block it on

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,600
your calendar how do you get people to

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,360
respect to not send you meeting invites

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,039
there

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,279
and also how do you you know turn off

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,159
notifications on slack

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,919
uh for that so i think um i think it

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,240
really has to come from the bottom up

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,120
i think declaring it whether you've seen

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,080
you know no meeting days or this or that

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,360
i feel like from the top down it isn't

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,039
all that helpful

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,960
other than to say that we should all

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,760
have these and to protect these and if

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,240
you feel like you

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,919
you you know you've worked to ensure

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,840
that the folks around you

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,600
have access you know have access to you

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,679
on a regular basis

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,440
and have ways to communicate with you

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,799
and people still aren't doing it then

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,320
you should you know then you should look

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,320
for leadership to help

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,320
make sure that everyone respects those

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,279
boundaries

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,240
all right thanks teresa for the answer

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:34,240
so um the next question for mike says

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:37,600
how many productivity tools are too many

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,960
i work in an environment where vendors

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,480
teams etc all have their own there's not

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,640
a single source

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,919
no one will budge what would you

00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,200
recommend as

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,039
the best two or three to plan the work

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,120
around

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,880
yeah i think this is problem and and

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,840
sort of like to the opposite

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,279
uh question uh that you have that that i

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,720
did or answered that i just gave you the

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,480
question above this

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,760
i actually think it has to come from the

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,440
top down

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,520
um you know you have to sort of reign in

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,720
how many productivity tools that you

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,119
have right

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,240
and i think that you know you need to go

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,280
to you need to be able to go to

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,800
leadership and say

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,520
you know because there's really two

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,040
impacts on your on an organization

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,639
when you have too many productivity

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,639
tools right one

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,480
you're not getting transparency you're

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,320
not getting a lot of the value

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,919
of having these collaboration or

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,599
productivity tools you're not actually

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,359
getting to experience them because you

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,599
don't even know where to find

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,560
the information that you need right

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,720
which is the goal

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,560
a goal with many of these tools is

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,159
actually to try and reduce how many

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,119
places you need to go to find an

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,800
answer um and secondly it ends up

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,599
costing your company a lot of money

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,200
because a team

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,599
you know to your point in this case it

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,639
may be an adjacent team that's using

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,240
um a different tool and for you to get

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,119
access to their information they now

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,280
have to

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,400
pay for a seat for you or a license

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,640
right and that

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,839
and that really adds up and so i think

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,839
you know

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,839
i look at one of my roles as sort of in

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,960
technology leadership is to

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,320
keep those in control right and say here

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,960
are the different needs

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,000
use cases that our organization has

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,200
right

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,079
and for the main types of productivity

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,400
tools

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,599
how do we what are what are the real

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,160
needs that we have

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,000
how do we evaluate them and select one

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,320
and implement it widely with good

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,800
integrations to really help drive

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,880
you know adoption and engagement in it

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,480
and if some team comes along so for

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,320
example where you let's say we're using

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,359
zoom and a team comes along and says we

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,240
want blue jeans

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,000
right i think leadership response for

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,480
the primary productivity

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,920
tools has to be like well what's missing

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,200
on in this case zoom

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,640
what's missing on the current

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,640
productivity tool that's supposed to

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,640
solve this use case

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,400
and is there a use case we missed or has

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,640
it changed or evolved

00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,680
right and sort of make a decision as a

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,280
company

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:06,480
do we add another one into this

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,079
and so i think um you know it you really

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,359
have to go to leadership and help them

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,240
understand

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,040
what having all of these tools and all

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,280
of these

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,280
ways for you to be disrupted or all the

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,400
places you have to look for

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,000
knowledge or information or answers and

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,160
help them understand the impact that's

00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,400
have that's having on all of you

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,920
and maybe ask for a more concerted

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,440
organized effort to come

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,280
up with the primary ones now there's

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,480
always going to be teams that need

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,280
additional

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,160
tools that are for their use case but

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,320
for the real

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,160
foundational ones i think you really

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,839
need to limit them to a handful

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,560
and tightly integrate them to get the

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,560
most benefit

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:54,880
uh thanks teresa so the next question is

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,320
from kevin says a lot of this requires

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,880
emotional labor on the paths of the team

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,599
members

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,400
how do we keep from placing an underdue

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,880
burden

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,000
on the women of the team or company

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,119
since often

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,640
this labor is offloaded to those members

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,480
of the team

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,240
that's a great question kevin and first

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,200
of all can i just give you kudos for

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,800
even

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,480
you know thinking about that and having

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,599
that point of view i would say since i

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,079
started working in

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,119
in technology 20 years ago uh we've come

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,720
we've come a long way

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,160
we've still got more to go but just the

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,480
fact that you're even thinking about

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,520
this

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,160
is uh is really important and i would

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,280
say like

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,240
you know as an individual like who's

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,880
aware of this as as you obviously are um

00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,640
i think it

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,640
you know it'd start by just saying it

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,560
out loud right saying

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,240
right how do we make sure that this you

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,119
know this emotional

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,520
labor is distributed across those of us

00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,119
right

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,880
different types of emotional labor

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,240
that's required here

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,359
um is uh is sort of distributed by the

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,400
folks who have certain

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,720
strengths or interests in uh

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,640
in working on this you know it's just

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,320
like i always say to a lot of my

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,280
uh my male colleagues are um

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,680
if you if you see something that's sort

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,280
of

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,440
unfair uh due to whatever reason to a

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,839
specific group in the team

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,119
someone who's in the group of the

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,680
majority

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,640
speaking up calling it out and talking

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,480
about it

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,280
goes a huge way um towards

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,599
making it than someone of that you know

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,640
underrepresented or minority group and

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,320
the team

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,320
sort of trying to stand up for

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,800
themselves so i would say

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,880
i i would start with just you know

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,200
saying it out loud acknowledging it and

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,480
then

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,160
trying to be really thoughtful as you

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,640
plan out how you implement

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,640
this work

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,640
thanks teresa um so the next question is

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,240
is really actually very important to me

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,280
too so um so

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,839
do you have any recommendations on how

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,560
to

00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,200
better manage interruptions from tools

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,320
like slack

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,240
i mean it's hard right um i would say a

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,040
couple recommendations i would say is

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,400
like

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,280
use your do not disturb on slack don't

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,240
feel like you know don't set people up

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,040
to expect

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,800
that you will respond to a slack message

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,680
day or night

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,920
um also like you know one personal thing

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,480
that i use my operating model that i

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,720
i share with people uh when when they

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,839
first start working with me

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,880
is actually to to say if you have a

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,520
question

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,760
reach out to me in slack if you actually

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,520
need me to take an action

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,440
right if you need me to do something

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,760
follow up on something

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,400
please um please like send me an email

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,440
because i'm not like like slack is not

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,119
where i manage

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,520
all of the work that i have to do and

00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,680
what i need to do and if you slack me

00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,800
asking me to take an action on something

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,280
it's unlikely it's well it's likely that

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,720
it'll get

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,400
missed because i'll read the slack

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,000
message and then the notification will

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,400
go away and i won't remember to come

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,920
back to it and how i like work to train

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,520
folks is actually that when they

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,119
actually do slack me with that

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,040
i'll respond to them and go can you

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,599
please send this request to me in an

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,240
email

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,359
right so i can manage it and prioritize

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,760
it um

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,560
appropriately so i think some of it's

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,640
just training

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,920
folks and setting expectations i always

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,119
say that

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,200
a huge amount of my my job day-to-day is

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,920
managing expectations

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,200
and um and and building context and i

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,760
think in this case

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,760
giving that context of how i use slack

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,640
and how it works for me versus how i use

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,319
email

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,079
is important and also setting

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,160
expectations uh

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,839
with the team of like what hours i'm

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,400
going to be less likely to be available

00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,400
we have

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,440
you know a lot of like away from

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,640
keyboard messages

00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,079
on and team um slack groups

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,920
uh where folks say i'm away from

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,680
keyboard for an hour

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,040
right i'm making lunch i'm going for a

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,000
walk i'm working out

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,160
right um i'm helping my my child with

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,640
their homeschooling or whatnot

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,079
um and so really you know saying that

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,040
out loud letting people know when you're

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,880
done for the day

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,800
and those groups so i think really about

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,839
managing expectations with your team can

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,839
be really helpful there

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,720
yeah thanks teresa so i usually make

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,240
this joke and i'll be like

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,800
what if um slack had a function where

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,640
you could

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,599
see that someone has read your message

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,200
and hasn't replied

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,040
and people will just find a workaround

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,440
around it like they do on uh

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,480
you know on on imessage and whatnot

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,240
right

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,520
yeah yeah so um the next question is

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,920
okay reality for a lot of us is

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,240
we are a small team and have to be

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,359
available for emergencies when they

00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,359
arise

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,440
while working across the country and

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,480
having different work times even on the

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,280
same team

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,920
so while i want to uh i want the team to

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,200
have a

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,920
dedicated work time if we if we do

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,920
need to address an emergency or an

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,560
emergency chat or email

00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,119
how do you suggest we filter those

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,040
through

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,160
while keeping the more general

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,560
informational notifications quiet

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,200
that's a great question right i think um

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,119
you know

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,040
all of these situations assume certain

00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,319
ideal scenarios and that's not actually

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,800
how we all work

00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,720
right i think one to come back to

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,240
expectation management which you know my

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,920
team thinks i come back to

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,400
a lot um but it would be agreeing with a

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,400
group

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,599
of what is an emergency because i think

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,640
it becomes if you

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,160
if you um everything because

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,079
if the best way to get a hold of people

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,400
is by declaring an emergency

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,319
then everything becomes an emergency

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,200
right so i think you know i would say

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,480
start with what is an emergency what is

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,079
it what is the sort of

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,040
impact or risk or sort of what are the

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,480
clarifying characteristics that say this

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,319
is an emergency

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,760
and then maybe it's a different slack

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,240
channel that you have

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,560
or a different way right a group text

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,680
message maybe it's something else

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,720
that you you use in those true

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,359
emergencies

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,960
right to convene people to to notify

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,760
them and convene them

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,000
um to work through that i would say you

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,000
know

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,680
bring it up with your team and ask right

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,200
you know we all want to have more

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,359
focused time

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,280
and less interruptions you know how do

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,960
we define what an emergency is and

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,319
what's the best way to

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,240
denote an emergency versus

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,760
all the other sort of you know

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,680
background noise that

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,680
in discussion that happens within a team

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,720
mission is uh i work

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,119
with a lot of people who are used to

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,160
having a meeting to discuss the schedule

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,119
for a meeting

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,359
how do i convince them that just an

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,800
email will be fine

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,560
yeah i think this comes back to what i

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,000
said earlier i said i think you have to

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,680
get the group

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,680
to come together and figure out what

00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,599
that meeting culture is

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,280
right what is that what is the meeting

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,680
culture that you want to have what is

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,760
the right time to have a meeting

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,000
and it takes effort right behavior

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,760
changing is a lot of work

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,599
but i think first what you have to do is

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,839
get buy-in one

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,280
that it is a problem that we're wasting

00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,720
folks time

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,280
by uh you know by having unnecessary

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,920
meetings

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,839
right um and uh

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,119
so step one acknowledge there's a

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:46,000
problem right

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,040
step two get everybody's you know input

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and opinions

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,359
on how we can improve the situation

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,480
right what are the steps

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,359
decision making that we can have to do

00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,000
this

00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,280
you know then get everyone to buy into

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,280
this and then to hold each other

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,880
accountable make it very visible

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,560
right make it a part of a meeting

00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,280
planning process that you have to put in

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,680
the meeting

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,440
you know here's the agenda here's what

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,119
you know the outcome of this the

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,560
you know the intended outcome of this

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,839
meeting is going to be

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:19,440
to try and get folks through there

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:22,000
and i think that wraps up my time right

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,000
i think that came out just perfect yeah

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,720
so i i think you have that just one

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,760
minute so

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,319
there's one more question okay in one

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,040
minute

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,160
so um how do you best encourage

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,400
participation

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,280
in meetings from those who are naturally

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,359
quiet or

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,760
need more time to process information

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,200
so for the naturally quiet i feel like

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,000
um that's not me

00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,760
as you can probably tell i'm actually an

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,560
extrovert in technology

00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,800
uh which tends to be more unusual um so

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,720
i think then those of us who are the

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,160
extroverts who tend to lean into the

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,280
conversations

00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,720
um need to ask other people's opinion we

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,599
need to pay attention

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,160
and ask folks uh who are more naturally

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,200
quiet

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,920
or haven't sort of spoken up what do

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,040
they think

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,079
right uh any concerns they have

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,920
right um i think we have to ask

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,920
right and then making a psychologically

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,440
safe place we sort of need to make space

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,040
for them if they don't feel like there's

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,720
already space from them or

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,560
for them or they're not already

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,599
naturally inclined

00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,079
um i think when uh when it comes to

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,040
needing

00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,400
more time to process i think you need to

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,240
ask that like our you know if we're

00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,200
trying to make a decision or whatnot we

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,920
need to say

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,520
um are we ready for are we ready for to

00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,280
make that decision or do we need to go

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,880
gather information or do people need to

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,920
do some analysis

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,000
right on this and ask those questions

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,359
rather than just assume that everyone's

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,200
ready to go forward and i think that

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,400
comes back to the psychologically safe

00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,920
place that we all

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,839
think and work and solve problems

00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,839
