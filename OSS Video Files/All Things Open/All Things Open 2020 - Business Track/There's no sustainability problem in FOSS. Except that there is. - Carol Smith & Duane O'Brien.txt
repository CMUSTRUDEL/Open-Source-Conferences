Abstract: The community seems to be rife with conversations about our sustainability problems. Do we actually have one? We’ll lead a discussion and debate around how we as a community can think about these issues, while drawing out the nuanced aspects of each as well as their potential solutions. 

When something like left-pad or event-stream happens, how much responsibility should be taken on by companies who deployed a dependency that was critical enough to their operations that removing it created immediate crisis, but not well supported or understood enough that there was any kind of mitigation strategy or backup plan?

And yet, when you look at OpenSSL, curl, and other pieces of open source infrastructure that live in our dependency chains, there are many examples of projects that are important enough to be critical, but are under-resourced to the point that maintainers are having to make quality-of-life tradeoffs to stay on top of the project. We are responsible for ensuring that our shared dependencies are sustainably developed. But who is holding us accountable?

If a maintainer is driving themselves to burnout because they are supporting too many of their open source projects, don’t they bear some responsibility for that choice?

But how are we supposed to untangle which of the thousands of dependencies that we use are in most need of support - and what kind of support they prefer?

Is there a sustainability problem in FOSS after all?

	00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,960
we're going to be talking about there is

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,080
no sustainability problem in foss except

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,759
that there is

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,679
um uh i'm dwayne o'brien i am the head

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,920
of open source at indeed

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,600
and i'm co-presenting today with carol

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,080
and i'm carol smith

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,199
and i'm with microsoft in the open

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,039
source programs office

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,400
as a pm all right does that look like

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,840
i'm sharing all right

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,840
yeah okay

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,719
there we are so do you want to

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,600
kick off the the primary subject yeah

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,640
uh so what we're talking today about is

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,120
something that

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
a lot of you have probably heard about

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,239
in

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,039
uh in the course of your work or your

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,079
experience

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,480
in foss in some way and

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,000
as we've seen there's a lot of headlines

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,039
there's a lot of talk about it

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,640
this word sustainability um and

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,720
in a lot of this discussion there seems

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
to be an implication that this is

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,520
something that's um

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
quite important for us to focus on this

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,080
is a problem um

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
and the implication is that there's also

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,240
uh by framing it as a problem that

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,479
there's also

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,960
a solution and that we should be talking

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,200
about uh what this problem is and

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,520
and how we could potentially be solving

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,159
it um and it's something that people are

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,119
uh fearful of it's on people's minds

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,479
people really want to

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,240
want to find a solution because it's

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,439
something that we need to be worried

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,040
about and so we wanted to

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,600
talk today about about what this

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,000
actually is and what it means

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,360
and sustainability is a subject that

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,159
people have been talking about for a

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,000
while it

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,159
might be a little hard to see depending

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,079
on the screen resolution but

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
that open source and sustainability

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,759
article written by the osi

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,640
the open source initiative down in the

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,880
bottom right corner was penned in 2008

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
so it's been a subject for for quite a

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,560
while

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,799
uh before we jump in um we'd like to ask

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,000
the participants to post into chat when

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
we say

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,439
uh when we say sustainability what does

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
sustainability

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,200
mean to you or what is what do you think

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959
about when you when you hear

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,879
uh people talk about sustainability as

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,160
it relates to open source

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,160
and we'll give people a couple of

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,680
moments to respond and chat and we'll

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,680
read the answers off as we see them

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,400
uh long-term success uh is one

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,239
observation from an attendee

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,840
uh not being able to revoke

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,560
contributions that's an interesting one

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,640
from another

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,640
uh um attendee

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,120
uh survival uh comes up uh thank you

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,120
uh dorothy

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,519
sustained by contributors

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,200
money is a subject that comes up uh

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
frequently in these conversations the

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,800
ability of participants to support the

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,040
project while making a decent living

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,519
certainly is another way to say that

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,440
and these these last two dwayne um there

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,000
come there comes an implication or a

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,840
subtext

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,599
that resources is something that's

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,800
involved in it that you need

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,599
either time or money or or the ability

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,720
to

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,760
uh to to sustain yourself in some way

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,120
either through

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,040
development time or more money yes

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,400
and and one last one and then we'll move

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,920
on from this slide uh to me

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
sustainability means the project

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,440
continues to be supported for its users

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,840
over the long term

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,519
and what's interesting about the the

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,040
comments that we got from the attendees

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,080
and the comments that we get when we

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,440
give this talk is that

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,159
no two people really give the same

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,599
answer uh and that sustainability uh

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,720
appears to have many different

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
definitions for folks

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,159
and that's uh and that's part of the uh

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,080
the

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,680
problem or the the issue that we're

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,400
we're raising here is that there isn't a

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,920
consistent

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,879
uh definition uh there's people say

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,799
sustainability

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,799
and um they kind of mean it as this

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
umbrella term that is meant to

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
uh reference a lot of different things

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,640
or evoke a certain feeling in a person

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
or

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,080
or um or a shared understanding although

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,319
there is no shared understanding

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
um and that we say sustainability

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,000
problem and we mean that there's a

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
sustainability solution as well but

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,040
there is in fact

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
not one single problem or one single

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,959
solution here

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,160
so what we're going to do over the

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,960
course of the talk is we're going to

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
look at some

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,400
specific case studies uh of events that

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,400
sometimes

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,320
come up in the conversation around

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080
sustainability as it relates to free and

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,600
open source software

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,000
and we're going to look at each of them

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,600
and and talk about if they are a

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,320
sustainability problem or

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
if they are a different kind of problem

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,000
we will talk about some other things

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
that uh sometimes get lumped in with the

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,160
sustainability conversation

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,759
uh and that can help us to talk about

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,400
them more meaningfully if we break them

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,600
out

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,720
and then we'll talk about work that

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
we're doing at our respective

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,280
organizations

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
uh to try to do our part to take uh

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,440
uh a position in in taking on

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
sustainability so

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,720
uh the first the first case study we're

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,199
gonna talk about

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,560
is left pad so the shortest version of

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,520
the story that i can give

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,000
for left pad was there was a developer

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,840
who had some npm packages

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,199
they got very angry with npm and they

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
decided to quit they took all of their

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,120
npm packages down

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,720
they deleted their projects from mbm and

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,240
we saw some of the headlines

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,000
earlier uh you know one developer

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,080
nearly broke the internet with 11 lines

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,080
of javascript so this developer took

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,479
down all his published packages

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,160
a bunch of things broke carol would you

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,600
describe this as a sustainability

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,000
problem

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,039
uh so no i would not but um i think the

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,520
important thing here

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,320
is that um this was the the headline

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,720
here was this is a

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,919
this is 11 lines of code and it broke

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,199
the internet it didn't really break the

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,960
internet but a lot a lot of people were

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280
were affected by this

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,840
um but these are all cases where uh

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,520
people or enterprises or organizations

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,520
or individual developers whatever the

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,639
case may be took a dependency on

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,560
this thing that was on the public

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,319
internet these 11 lines of

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,160
code that were on the public internet

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,199
and were depending on it in

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,720
a in a production setting and uh

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,120
and then when it went down uh they

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,639
didn't have it anymore and that was a

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,319
business decision

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,039
that those folks made uh that had

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,840
had uh nothing to do with with whether

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,680
or not the

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,440
uh the person the person who made the

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,080
mpm package had enough

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,600
time or resources or development uh that

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,639
was a that was a decision that those

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,400
those folks made

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,319
and and then maybe they were kicking

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,000
themselves for for having made because

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,160
they took a dependency on something

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,360
uh that then was able to take them down

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,600
uh but

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,160
applying more time or money or resources

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,240
to uh to that developer to that person

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,440
uh would not have fixed the the business

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,720
process the business

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,120
uh issue that uh that those folks

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,960
ran into once uh their dependency was

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,960
was taken down

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,199
and and also worth noting that the uh

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,960
left pad wasn't even the the package

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,400
that was at the core of the

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,160
of the dispute that the developer was

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,680
having with npm and the nature of the

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,360
dispute was there was a

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,199
uh there was a trademark in play there

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,400
was a company who owned a trademark then

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,599
the developer was sitting in the

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,280
in the that trademarks namespace and npm

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,960
had no choice but to come down on the

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,000
side of the trademark holder

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,440
um and it originally started off because

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
of an unrelated package when the

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,520
developer took down all of their

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
packages

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,960
um suddenly it magnified this this

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,039
significant

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
problem that that we had propagated

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,319
throughout the ecosystem

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,160
clearly we learned something though from

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,240
left pad because it was a few

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,800
years later we wound up with uh with

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,199
event stream so uh event stream

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,160
uh was another uh mpm package and the

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,120
shortest version

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,560
of of this story is that there was a

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,120
fairly stable

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,960
node module hadn't changed in a while uh

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,080
the maintainer was no longer interested

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,520
in maintaining

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,440
um event stream a stranger

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,360
showed up they made a couple of

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,080
contributions into the project

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,000
uh and offered to take it over the

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,280
maintainer said sure and then the

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,919
the the new maintainer uh injected some

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,240
crypto

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,319
stealing code or crypto mining code uh

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,639
into the event stream package

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,919
and it was you know then published uh so

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,919
carol was this

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,680
a sustainability problem um also not uh

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,080
but for for different reasons in this

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,479
case

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,959
um what we're talking about is kind of

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,320
uh divested responsibility so

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,120
so uh folks uh so

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,599
uh folks on the internet uh in this case

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,919
do uh have a dependency on this as well

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,040
but

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,519
um but again the maintainer

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,399
uh given more time energy money

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,399
resources more

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,800
more development time uh this would not

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,279
have affected this this is a security

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,920
problem

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,160
uh maybe this is uh maybe this is again

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,600
uh we should we should talk about how

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,000
um we could lessen the effect of a

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,920
malicious uh package getting getting out

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,399
there or or affecting folks

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,279
um but applying more time money or

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,440
resources to

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,959
to this uh to the situation probably

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,000
would not would not have

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,519
have helped it either uh although uh you

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,399
know

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,279
we we could talk and we will in later

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
slides about

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,640
whether more security research and

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,839
vulnerability

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,240
um research would have helped

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,839
and it's also worth calling out with

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,360
relation to event stream that

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,080
if this was a a bad bad faith action

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,120
right if

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,839
if the maintainer uh who owned this

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,560
mature

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,920
node module had decided intentionally i

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,160
i would like to use

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,839
you know my my node module footprint to

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,560
inject crypto code

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,920
uh across the ecosystem nothing would

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,440
have prevented them from doing that we

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,920
were more or less taking it on

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,959
on good faith that maintainers wouldn't

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,839
do this so

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,360
nothing would have been prevented um or

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,360
would have prevented someone from

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,839
from acting as a bad actor in this

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,839
particular case

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,480
uh and so let's talk a little bit

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,600
more about uh actually i want to come i

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,640
want to come back for a second

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,040
um i when the

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,160
after this uh event stream issue

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
occurred uh

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,240
there was a post by the maintainer where

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,720
they were

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,160
talking about uh sort of their response

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,560
to the whole thing

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,240
and in in a sense i thought their

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,000
response fell short because they were

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
pushing responsibility off to

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,680
to the folks who had taken the

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,279
dependency and sort of appealed to the

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,360
idea that you know this was

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,600
i wasn't being paid to maintain this uh

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,519
i you know this is kind of

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,360
you know what this is this is what you

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,720
get for free right

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,440
um and uh i i felt like took

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,079
a bit of an arms-length um approach to

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,640
his

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,240
his own responsibility in that uh in

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,920
that scenario um

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,440
and tried to make the problem into

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,880
someone else's problem

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,160
i do think the maintainer bore some

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,440
amount of responsibility for the

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,640
decision that was made to hand this

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,720
package over

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,240
to a maintainer without vetting them so

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,440
there was some personal responsibility

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,720
in there as well

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,560
well and this is this is also

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
interesting dwayne because they're

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,760
i think we are we would draw a

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,800
distinction between responsibility and

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,200
sustainability

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,720
uh we seem there seems to be a subtext

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,320
when we say sustainability that

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,920
we mean that everyone will be acting in

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,360
good faith all of the time as well and

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,839
that we expect that if the

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,680
if the ecosystem is working correctly uh

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,279
that that all folks will do will always

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,480
do the right thing with a capital r and

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,079
a capital t

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,279
um and and uh and that's i i think we're

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,360
drawing a distinction there

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,959
and the fact that um there will still we

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,000
still have to accept that there will be

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,519
people who act in bad faith who um make

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,519
the wrong decisions or make decisions

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,920
that we just disagree with and that

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,800
the ecosystem has to be able to uh to

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,440
accommodate that

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,800
but that that might be that those are

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,360
separate things from

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,360
um making a project um easier to

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,279
maintain or having developers who aren't

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,560
stressed out or having enough money and

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,880
resources to

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,160
um to do work and in fuss that you're

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,560
interested in doing on a day-to-day

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,560
basis

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,600
so let's go on to talk a little bit

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
about

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,279
event streams so uh sorry not event

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,160
stream heartbleed

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,880
sorry as predicted the garbage trucks

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,880
are outside

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,560
literally outside my office right now so

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,279
it's i'm trying to manage two things at

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,399
the same time

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,320
i hope they're not coming through the

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,720
mic um so uh

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,839
heartbleed there is a widely used open

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,040
source library it has an undiscovered

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,720
vulnerability that lay dormant for a

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,720
couple of years

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,399
and discovery of the vulnerability leads

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,240
to a large-scale

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,920
upgrade effort hundreds of thousands of

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,639
public web servers

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,279
uh that needed to get updated in the

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,560
process

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:57,279
of digging into the problem uh

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,920
really highlighted that uh the library

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,040
was

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,680
largely volunteer maintained famously by

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,240
two guys named steve uh was was the

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
catchy

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,279
headline that was going around for a

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,760
while carol

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,440
was heartbleed the the result of a

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,600
sustainability problem

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,920
um the of the three cases that we've

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,560
presented i suppose this is probably one

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,040
one that's closer to a sustainability

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,120
problem

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,120
in that this is a case of of

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,399
interdependency and so

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,399
um and in this case this might have been

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,079
discovered if we had for example applied

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,079
more resources

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,240
time and or money and or development

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,200
work on trying to find the security

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,200
vulnerability

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,320
it's also possible uh it might not have

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,880
been and so

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,320
this is i think falls into a bit of a a

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,639
gray area here

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,480
um as you said it was maintained by two

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,160
guys named steve so maybe if it had

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
had more maintainers who were able to

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,720
fork it focus on a wider

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,800
uh set of issues within the within the

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,920
project they had been able to do more

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,519
more research possibly uh so so of the

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,560
three this is this probably falls a

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,279
little bit more into the

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,399
the sustainability category um but also

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,639
possibly not uh

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,639
and so uh i think we need to also

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,120
consider kind of these gray area cases

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,079
where

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,079
um even with more time money resources

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,639
uh even if we had all accepted that

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,839
we're all

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,240
uh very uh interdependent

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,360
uh it still may not have have solved the

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,399
problem may not have

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,440
have uh fixed it but uh it's it's

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,839
certainly it's possible and and the

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,000
interdependency here is

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,880
is like points us

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,079
toward the overall solution to things

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,480
that really are

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,800
sustainability problems there's there's

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
so much that we depend on and so much

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,600
interdependency in the system

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,920
that it's that it's not something any

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,560
one or two or few organizations that can

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,120
can take on we as a whole community need

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,440
to

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,959
have robust processes and robust

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,800
practices in place

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,959
um so that we can make sure that all of

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,560
these interdependent

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,720
libraries and dependencies and modules

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,920
and frameworks have the support that

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,079
they need

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,199
and working together is really important

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,079
here

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,000
by way of example if you work in an open

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,040
source program office like like carol or

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,600
i do you spend a lot of time uh

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,120
inevitably dealing with the issue of

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,560
inventory and compliance you need to

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,519
know which software that you're running

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,199
which libraries that

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,600
you're dependent on and understand what

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,399
your license obligations are

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,680
and you get a good view into the

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,040
dependencies that

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,040
are used by your organization and

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,720
and even in a modestly sized

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
organization that can be tens and

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,320
thousands

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,279
of of direct dependencies that are used

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,040
by

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,959
software that you build applications

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,600
that you deploy into production

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,279
um and it's a lot to keep track of and

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,880
looking at all of them

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,800
is very very challenging there's a lot

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,600
of signal to noise

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,480
and um filtering that is is a tough

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,600
problem

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,040
uh and it's it's one that

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,440
i think we're still working to solve

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,079
collectively as a community

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,880
um so let's uh talk a little bit about

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,240
uh

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,880
pipi uh and i'll i'll i'll lead into

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,560
this one

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:18,000
um uh a little bit so uh

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,600
in 2017 the the pi pi code base was old

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,800
it was volunteer run

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
um there they were working on a sort of

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,920
a new

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,440
um uh underpinning for pipi called uh

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,880
warehouse there was a lot of questions

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,160
about when's it going to be released

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,839
they needed some help

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,000
uh and the mozilla open source support

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,199
program issued a hundred and seventy

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,199
thousand dollar grant

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,320
um to help address the sustainability of

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,959
the project

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,839
uh and then in 2018 as a result of that

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,320
funding

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,320
pipei was able to relaunch powered by

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,360
this new warehouse code base

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,639
and it went further from that you know

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,839
there were subsequent grants that

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,040
allowed them to add some additional

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,600
security features to pi

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,800
pi two-factor authentication improving

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,880
the web interface for

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,839
users with disabilities making it more

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,160
accessible

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,000
adding locale support and more security

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,640
focused features overhauling the pip

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,880
user experience and dependency resolver

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,079
um carol was this a sustainability

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,959
problem

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,079
so yeah so in this case this is um a

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,520
case where we

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,039
actually do think like they were able to

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,120
they had sustainability problems they

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,839
had problems that they wanted to solve

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,959
within their

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,000
with their project and a grant was made

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,080
of money uh to to help them uh

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,400
fix these things to solve these problems

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,320
and yes this what this was a case where

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
uh they were able to take take money

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,760
translate it to into

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,120
uh resources and development time and

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,440
and use it to

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,720
uh to solve some of the fix some of the

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,640
things they were they were

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,240
interested in working on uh we can't

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,520
unfortunately do the counter factual

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,080
that if they hadn't received

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,360
this money would some problem have uh

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,760
ended up surfacing but

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,000
uh but in this case uh we can take this

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,559
as uh this was a case where actually

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,360
uh yes money was able to to be uh

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,840
applied and

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,440
and problems were able to be solved and

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,559
potentially problems were able to be

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,559
avoided in this case

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,640
so when we say there is no

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,039
sustainability in

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,240
in problem and foss except that there is

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,240
the problem isn't that

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,600
there there there is only one

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,280
sustainability problem there are a lot

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,000
of different things that sometimes get

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,600
conflated with sustainability problems

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,559
um are there any of these in particular

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,880
carol that you want to speak to

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,880
um well i i think they're all they're

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,760
all interesting for different reasons um

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,160
as we've said uh people are using this

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
one

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,600
uh blanket umbrella term to to mean a

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,320
lot of different things

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,200
so uh in some cases uh we have

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,120
maintainers who

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,960
we have a single maintainer who is

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,440
maintaining a single project

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,200
that uh the entire internet depends on

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,160
that big enterprises depend on

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,640
and uh and so and they're not setting uh

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,760
boundaries well and so uh they're

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,880
working 16 20 hour days every day uh

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,520
because they're the only person who's

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,880
maintaining

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,960
uh this project and um and

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,280
in this case maybe they're choosing to

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,480
to do that maybe they're not but uh

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,880
you know if we gave them more uh

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,400
more maintainers more more people uh

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,960
would would they take them what would it

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
help

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,559
um and and boundary setting is a problem

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
um and then uh sort of the other side of

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,640
that is is resourcing

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,840
where basically projects just grow and

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,799
grow and grow and they don't have enough

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,400
maintainers they don't

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,799
just don't have enough people in the

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,640
community to support the ongoing

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,919
prs and issues that are that are getting

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,400
created

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,280
and and that is sustainability in it in

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,559
a different way and

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,880
and uh could could also be a problem

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,320
go ahead dwayne and i i think it's

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,679
important to call out here that

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,240
that as a maintainer if you are you know

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,520
working at a job that isn't supporting

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,039
you as a maintainer and you're

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,799
maintaining your projects in your own

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,520
personal time

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,520
you don't have an obligation to say yes

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,200
and and boundary setting to make sure

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,240
that you have a healthy work-life

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,919
balance

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,360
is is important it is important to you

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,960
it is important to your health it is

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,840
important for the project

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,080
so um you hear sometimes about

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,720
maintainers who are really struggling to

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
to balance

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,080
an eight-hour job and then all these

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,120
maintainer responsibilities if your job

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
isn't going to support you as a

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,240
maintainer hey

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,039
like find somebody to to work for that

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,080
will because

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,919
we're out there um but b you know

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,760
start saying no in your project and

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,200
claim back some of your time

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,520
because that time belongs to you and you

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,799
should be willing and able to use it how

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,240
you want

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:43,520
um there's also you know sort of

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,120
a lot of conversation about the amount

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,880
that companies give back

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,400
in relation to what they're taking from

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
the open source community

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,400
it is important that companies give back

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,159
in proportion to what they're getting

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,919
right and so uh sometimes

00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,520
uh the problems that arise or that

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,320
manifest in these projects are

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,679
a result from a wide wide user base that

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,280
is making feature requests but not

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,200
putting any particular skin in the game

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,360
whether it's financial support

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,799
or showing up as additional maintainers

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,720
and contributors to the project

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,480
so if your company is benefiting from

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,760
open source you should be

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,120
sure that you're giving back in

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,080
proportion to the benefit that you're

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,520
receiving

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,880
um i talked a little bit earlier about

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,480
the signal to noise and the in the

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,080
dependencies that are

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
uh that are in our respective

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,880
organizations uh if there are tens of

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,039
thousands of direct dependencies that

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,640
uh are all looking for help how do i

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,960
know which ones are the most important

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,520
to help i can probably make a

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,720
a pretty good uh assessment of which

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,159
which projects

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,000
are the most important to my

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,360
organization if they're in the top 10 or

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,600
in the top 20.

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,480
uh in the top thousand that's a little

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
harder

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,960
uh and you know am i do i give them all

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,200
ten thousand dollars

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,280
we know that's not financially you know

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,320
feasible for most organizations

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,280
so really doing work as a community to

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,679
help understand

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,120
which dependencies will benefit the most

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,480
from um

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,480
from our support and what kind of

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,640
support they want when it when it comes

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,440
to that

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,360
a lot of projects we know don't actually

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,880
want significant funds they'd be

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,320
perfectly happy with five dollars for a

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,480
cup of coffee or they would rather have

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,159
somebody show up and write code

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,320
uh than have someone show up and write a

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,880
check and if i could just jump in there

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,640
dwayne

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,080
that's a really good point as well

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,559
because um i think

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
a lot of the conversation here is like

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,760
we're we're trying to

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,520
uh give money or contribute upstream in

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,240
order to avoid problems like

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,039
a left a left pad or an event stream uh

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,200
and that

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,080
those two shouldn't be drawn so so

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,720
closely together

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,200
it may not be that the project wants the

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,679
the

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,120
the money or the resources um and and

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,760
you're not going you're never going to

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
avoid a

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,880
developer getting angry and pulling

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,679
their npm packages uh

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,280
off the web so so do it because it's the

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,280
right thing to do or because

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,640
you're you want to support your

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,039
dependencies not because

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,080
you want to draw a close distinction a

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,400
close um

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,240
relationship between uh your money and

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,760
your contributions and we're never going

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,000
to run into a sustainability problem

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,120
ever

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,600
again thank you

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,840
um the last point on here i want to

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,760
speak to very briefly before we we go on

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,440
and talk about

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,880
ways that we are trying to take on this

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,080
problem in our own organization

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,720
and that's bad planning

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,720
and what i mean by bad planning here is

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,679
organizations that prioritize

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,400
new feature work over supporting the

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,919
features

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,080
and the projects that they have already

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,840
deployed so if you uh

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,000
if your organization is adopting open

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,640
source technologies in order to help

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,320
deploy

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,760
products to market faster which is very

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,840
common and you're not building into

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,200
any of your future planning the

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,760
long-term support

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,360
for those open source dependencies that

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,600
have helped you get there

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,960
whether it's simply making sure that

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,559
you're staying on top of maintenance and

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,000
updates or making sure that those

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,880
projects are going to be sustainable for

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,720
long term

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,320
your priorities are a little off right

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,919
like you're prioritizing

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,919
new feature development over long-term

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,679
support and you need both

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,039
uh your organization won't be able to

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,600
grow without it

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,360
if you only take one thing away from the

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,000
presentation today

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,039
um i would we want it to be this slide

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,559
right like if you paint

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,320
everything with the broad brush saying

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,120
oh it's a sustainability problem sorry i

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,520
just hit my mic

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,559
it's a sustainability problem um it's

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,400
very hard to have

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,080
specific conversations about what the

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,080
problems really are so

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,760
whenever you are in a conversation and

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,320
people say this is a sustainability

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,159
problem

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,600
ask what do you mean by sustainability

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,520
and call back to that slide that we had

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,440
earlier we said what does it mean to you

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,559
uh and uh we all had different

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,400
definitions

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,000
um now i wanna i wanna pause just for a

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,440
second and say i see some

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,039
activity in the chat i see a question in

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,559
the q a we will have a q a

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,400
portion here coming up in a few minutes

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,159
and we'll take those on so

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,600
if you have questions feel free to start

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,440
seeding those questions in

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,720
and we'll take them on as we come into

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,279
the next bit

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,640
so um let's talk about doing your part

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,640
um

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,000
uh to call back to this slide i really

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,240
we're going to focus on

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,159
these two aspects of of the

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,679
sustainability problems under resourcing

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,679
projects that have grown faster than

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,679
supports and lack of participation

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,640
corporate users with limited returns to

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,520
the project

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,279
uh and these are uh particular areas

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,080
where carol and i are are both

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,120
involved in our organizations no one

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,520
problem could address

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,120
all of these specific facets of the

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,600
sustainability

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,600
conversation but we're going to focus on

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,919
these two

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,720
and so this is going to focus primarily

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,440
around

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,200
the foss contributor fund program a

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,520
quick overview of what that

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,720
is is it is a is a pool of funds that

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,559
you set aside to

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,760
sustain uh to support your open source

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,159
dependencies

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,080
um and you distribute those funds by

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,000
establishing a criteria that determines

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,520
which dependencies are eligible

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,120
uh you ask your members of your

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,799
organization which ones uh

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,320
you they think should be funded and then

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,840
you hold a vote um

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,760
between the foss contributors within

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,960
your organization so

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,960
everybody who makes an open source

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,240
contribution gets to vote on on where

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,320
those funds go

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,480
um i want to acknowledge that money is

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,240
not a substitute for other resources or

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,799
time but it is often uh a an easier

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,400
thing for

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,919
companies to bring to the table than

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,279
developer time

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,440
and by aligning uh the the ability to

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,120
vote with your participation in open

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,120
source communities it can also encourage

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,640
you to to get involved there

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,159
i've added a link here that will take

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,000
you to uh

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,600
the basic foss contributor fund document

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
up on github that describes the

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,080
framework

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,600
for the program um carol anything you

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,520
want to add here before

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,960
we talk about what it's like at indeed

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,799
yeah uh just yeah

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,080
i mean so you we've sliced down kind of

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,360
the sustainability

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,520
conversation just to uh resourcing and

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,840
and participation and now we're even

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,799
slicing within within that conversation

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,600
to say like

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,480
this is not this is doesn't even addre

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,960
fully address

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,480
even those two topics this is just one

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,520
one small slice of

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,919
uh things that organizations can do and

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,200
again yeah money is not a solution uh or

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,520
a substitute but this is

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,320
this is one thing that uh we can do as

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,720
part of the much

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,159
much broader conversation that has has

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,120
many different facets to it

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,120
so the foss contributor funded indeed uh

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,000
the way that it works is we hold votes

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,399
once a month

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
um anyone and indeed is eligible to

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,279
nominate a project

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,880
um and projects are eligible if they are

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,039
in use at indeed

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,799
if they're not employee owned if they

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,159
use an osi approved license and they

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,120
have some way to receive

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,880
funds and when i say the project has to

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,480
be in use that indeed that might mean

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,120
it's a piece of infrastructure it might

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,720
mean it's a

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,399
framework that we use to deploy

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,440
applications could be a direct

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,520
dependency

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,880
could be the software that it uses to

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,640
image new laptops for

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,000
for new hires it just has to be used

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,120
somewhere

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,120
the project that gets selected by uh

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,960
open source contributors uh receives ten

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,080
thousand dollars and to date we funded

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,760
21 projects

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,679
uh with over uh two hundred thousand

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,440
dollars uh pushed into

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,039
uh the open source ecosystem through our

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,279
foss contributor fund

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,159
over what time frame was that dwayne oh

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,559
thank you yes

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,320
uh we started that at the beginning of

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,960
2019 so we're just

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,919
approaching the end of our second year

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,960
uh yeah and so

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,039
microsoft started a program

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,200
for foss contributing as well that is

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,760
modeled after indeed's program and we

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,919
have been

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,279
running it for a much shorter uh time

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,880
which is why i i

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,399
wanted to to draw the distinction

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,559
between uh

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,320
uh microsoft and indeed's programs uh

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,720
microsoft's been running this for about

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,399
about four months now um so we have

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,960
funded three projects so far but it's

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,720
the same

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,720
it's the same model which is it needs to

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,120
be something that's uh that microsoft

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,240
uses

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,520
uh which is a a broad category of things

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,279
and and includes

00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,840
uh many many many different kinds of

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,240
projects and also needs to be

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,960
under an osi approved license and and

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,559
not

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:10,240
maintained by anyone at microsoft but

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,640
we also take um nominations for

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,679
projects from from employees and then we

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,640
actually have an

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,399
eligibility for uh for voting that we

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,279
based on whether or not

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,200
an employee has contributed to a open

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,279
source project in the last

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,559
uh in the last time frame so in the last

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,000
30 days

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,600
you become eligible if you've made a

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,039
contribution externally

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,039
you become eligible to vote if you've

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,559
made a contribution externally

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,159
and then you can vote on the projects

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,360
that have been nominated for that uh

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,399
time period

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,200
so it is meant to not only uh

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,880
encourage our contributions to these

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,399
projects that we rely on but also to

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,000
encourage microsoft employees to

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,600
contribute in order to become eligible

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,399
to vote and to participate

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,200
in the open source ecosystem as a whole

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,200
and

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,799
as you see uh we've funded three

00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,840
projects so far but it's the same

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,960
uh same model as indeed and we we've

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,039
both used the word

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:09,120
contribution here um maybe a little

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,399
sloppily but um i believe and carol feel

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,520
free to correct me if i'm wrong here i

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,960
believe we like both of our

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,640
organizations take a very broad view of

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,399
what contribution means here

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,080
it is not necessarily just a pull

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,600
request it does not necessarily just a

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,880
code contribution

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:27,039
um in our case um it can be as simple as

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,960
commenting on a bug upvoting a bug

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,159
registering a bug with with a project

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,679
that we use

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,919
um that is when you ask me whenever i

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,840
have asked maintainers i should say

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,440
what is the simplest and most easy

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,000
contribution someone can make to your

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,159
project

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
consistently the answer i get is file

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,520
bugs right like tell us when you

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,440
find an issue don't complain about it on

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,559
twitter because we'll never see it

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,480
um yes

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,240
an expansive view it's it is definitely

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
not just code it is also participating

00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,640
in

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,399
conversations and issues and and other

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,559
things like that as well so it's

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,840
a much much broader than than just code

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,399
prs

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,360
and and really at the at the heart of

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,519
the

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,960
the intention behind the program in both

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,039
of our organizations

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,399
uh is not just to drive financial

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,720
support into

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,840
um our own dependencies although it is

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,760
an important part

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,000
it is to get people involved in

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,000
contributing to open source as well

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,200
uh because showing up as contributors

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,039
and helping to

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,120
maintain and support these dependencies

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,919
is is the way that we take on

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,480
the broad broad topic of sustainability

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,519
in its many facets so um

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,120
with that uh i will um take us into the

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,440
question slide and carol

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,200
do you want to read the back chat read

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,880
the q and a or field questions

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,799
which which one would you well we have

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,320
one we have one question in q a so i can

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,600
read that one and then we can

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,200
uh we can see um if if there's more

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,519
questions that surface in chat or in the

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,120
meanwhile so the question in q a

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,120
is uh how do you continue to support a

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,120
project you love and support yourself

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,600
uh who are you answering to how can you

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,640
broach this subject and share your feels

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,159
uh blogs meetings uh et cetera um

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,919
so i assume this is taking the

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,000
perspective of how do you

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,960
as a person who's just an individual

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,679
developer

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,240
uh continue to support uh projects you

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,279
love

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,320
individually um so don't you have any uh

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,600
thoughts on that interesting i i i heard

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,200
that as

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,519
a little differently i heard that is i

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,000
am i am an individual developer

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,519
who is maintaining a project but i also

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,799
need to make a living

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:36,000
um uh and if that is the nature of the

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,000
way the question was asked

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,240
it's if you don't have a project that

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,320
has gotten to the point that people are

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,760
able to pay you for support either

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,600
through github sponsors through

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,159
open collective or something like that

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,440
um there are many organizations

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:57,039
that uh will employ you as

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,039
an open source contributor and

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,880
support your work for supporting and

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,840
maintaining that project but also ask

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,080
you to do work for

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,039
for them it's a very common pattern uh

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,480
in the industry

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,200
um you know sometimes uh

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,039
it is about hiring uh maintainers of

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,799
dependencies the organization uses so if

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,600
you know who your users are

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,200
um finding work with uh some of them can

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,120
can also help but there are other

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,200
organizations that are a little more

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,320
um liberally minded when it comes to

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,279
this and are

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,360
happy to to employ you in sort of a

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,600
split time uh arrangement uh carol do

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,519
you have other thoughts

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,880
uh no i think that's i think that's good

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,880
i mean i think it probably

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,360
um there's there's nuance here depending

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,039
on when you started the project

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,120
why you started the project is it this

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,320
labor of love for you or is it is it a

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,640
more transactional

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,760
you you'd really like more people to be

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,360
using it and

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,679
do you like to make make it a business

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,799
make money on it um how many people rely

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,080
on it how many people are in your

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,760
community do you have

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,760
um colleagues who are maintainers is it

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,240
really just you um so those

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,200
those are important questions i uh i

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,519
think but i mean

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,399
yeah as a general thing it is uh

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,159
difficult to

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,399
to surface yourself as a as a small

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:12,240
project that a lot of folks

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,079
rely on but um absolutely blogs um

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,359
meetings with folks work working your

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,599
network is important

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,520
um but yeah i think i think you covered

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,919
at dwayne

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,040
i'll call out uh a comment from the chat

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,520
as we're working our way

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,960
um through the backlog uh it's sad when

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,159
open source maintainers blame the very

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,839
nature open source we need to be

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,960
uplifting open source not tearing it

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,399
down

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,720
100 agree um i maintainer

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,919
frustration is is a real thing and i

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,280
have empathy for

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:44,159
for that um i

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,200
want to understand which maintainers of

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,440
our dependencies

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,200
need help so that we can show up and

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,879
help in meaningful ways

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,560
um before they get to the point that

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,240
they just get angry that at open source

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,960
and open source is broken

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,520
um it is it is more of that signal to

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,800
noise

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,720
uh problem um from my perspective

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,240
um what if every project required a

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,359
second like a motion does and if

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,640
someone's not willing to sponsor

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,160
co-design the loan so to speak it

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,200
doesn't go forward

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,960
um that that is sort of a governance

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,079
question not so much a sustainability

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,800
question but it's an interesting one

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:20,320
carol any thoughts

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,920
um i mean

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,240
i guess this is more this is yeah this

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,800
is more a interdependency problem maybe

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,520
or a

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,320
um like we're all kind of in it together

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,800
and

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,680
and some people are just not going to

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,280
act uh

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,960
in good faith or in the way that that we

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,960
expect them to or or do the right thing

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,839
with a capital r and capital t

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,400
um i actually i don't know if i have a

00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,040
good

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,480
a good answer to that that's a tough

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,680
problem it is

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,880
um there was some good conversation and

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,560
some back and forth in the chat about

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,880
the the role of patronage

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,680
um uh in this scenario uh if you are

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,000
relying on a wealthy patron to write a

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,400
check

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,760
to sustain you is that a good thing or a

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,640
bad thing

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,760
um and i i apologize to folks who are

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,800
participating in that conversation

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,040
because i'm still

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,839
also trying to parse the the the back

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,640
thread for it so

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,480
um i think that

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,320
my personal opinion here is that

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,520
patronage by itself

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,280
is not a a long-term solution to any of

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,760
the problems that have a sustainability

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,720
facet to them right

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,720
it is a good place to start for

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,359
organizations who are not involved right

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,880
now

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,640
and i i see this very much as a

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,400
as a process if you work at an

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,880
organization who uses open source it

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,119
isn't doing anything to support it

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,000
you can start with patronage or you can

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,920
start with just

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,200
getting people encouraged to contribute

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,400
and getting permission for people to

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,119
contribute

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,640
um and once you're there what's the next

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,680
best thing that you can do and

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,400
and go forward from there um carol any

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,800
thoughts

00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,160
uh no but we do have another question in

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,480
the q a so i'll

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,079
uh read that uh often knowing how to

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,839
look for and taking time to build a

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,720
platform to get support is difficult and

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,160
maybe

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,359
alien skills different skills have any

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,160
efforts to

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,160
to make to make the kinds of programs

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,680
you mentioned as open platforms

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,760
uh that a project can adopt without

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,280
having to be experts themselves or

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,720
having those sorts of experts

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,320
in the community um

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,680
i don't think i'm quite parsing this

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,680
question sorry uh

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,960
i'm i'm also reading it myself here so

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,680
have any efforts to making kinds of

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,680
programming missions

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,119
themselves um uh yeah apologies to the

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
to the asker there i

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,400
i don't i don't know that i'm getting um

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,240
uh

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,520
the gist of the question either but feel

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,800
free to to

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,200
add a clarification and we'll pay

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,920
attention to the q a yeah

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,160
um what else oh uh there was there was a

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,079
question also in the chat about

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,160
uh the idea that maintainers might get

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,599
pushback for setting boundaries

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:09,359
um and that is

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,200
an unfortunate reality right um

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,720
there has there has grown this

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,160
expectation for

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,320
a subset of the uh people who consume

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,240
and use open source

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,359
that they can place expectations on a

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,560
project

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,320
without participating in it and we see

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,480
this manifest all the time in different

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,560
ways whether it's

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,640
short or curt or maybe even rude bug

00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,400
reports um

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,400
uh or just unhelpful ones like this is

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,079
broken fix it why haven't you fixed this

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,440
right um what we can do from within our

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,560
own organizations

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,839
is a set good standards for how we

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,640
expect people to behave

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,480
when they are opening bugs in in

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,000
projects that we use

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,320
and b um drive a more participatory

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,359
style of working with open source

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,119
projects

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,800
uh one of the things that we do

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,960
consistently

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,560
i'll i'll i'll speak very personally one

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,320
of the things i do consistently when

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,720
when um someone comes to

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,560
uh our program office and says hey like

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,960
there's there's this thing that we use

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,240
it has this open bug it looks like the

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,440
maintainer is

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,680
is mia or they have they have no

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,359
no longer maintaining the project um

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,800
we'd like to get this bug fixed or

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,200
there's a pull request open

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,079
that fixes this bug like what can we do

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,119
um

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,839
and consistently my advice for them

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,000
is to open with is there anything that

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,920
we can do to help this

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,920
land right um so go go beyond just

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,839
upvoting the problem or go beyond

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,599
um uh saying yes i also have this

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,640
problem or can we fix this

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,079
offer to help and and and position

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,599
yourself as someone who is showing up to

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,440
the project who's willing to roll up

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,800
your sleeves and get involved

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,480
um yeah i've seen a i've seen a shade of

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,400
that domain which is um

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,400
sort of a a person or an organization or

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,319
something uh gets really involved in

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,240
a community or in a project and then

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,119
they start uh submitting a bunch of pull

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,760
requests and

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,960
and getting active active in the in the

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,720
code in the community

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,720
uh but then the review and the merging

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,680
of the pull requests is maybe falling

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,079
behind because there's

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,680
maybe one maintainer or two maintainers

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,079
um and then i think i think that's a

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,640
matter

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,280
of um actually what we need to be doing

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,720
in

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,319
getting involved in the community is

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,920
actually working with the maintainer on

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,599
how can we how can we take some of the

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,520
burden of the maintenance

00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,520
off your shoulders how can we work with

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,079
you how can we grow ourselves to become

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,040
uh maintainers as well is that is that

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,760
uh in your

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,160
in your long-term uh project plan uh to

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,640
to

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,160
grow more maintainers um the sort yeah i

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,640
mean as you said it like sort of

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,359
the walk up and and start expecting

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,720
things

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,760
uh that's uh that's just

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,200
not not good uh not not being a good

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,520
community citizen

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,280
uh and and not not approaching the the

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,040
problem correctly but yes it

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,880
absolutely is a problem for maintainers

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,480
and i think i think we

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,480
we as a community need to continue to

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,040
keep it uh top of our minds and make

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,160
sure that we're

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,520
we're acting acting in the right way

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,359
uh we're we're at 11 minutes so um do we

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,119
want to take one more and then

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,640
call it or what do you want to do here

00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,839
dwayne

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,640
um pretty close yeah we can we we can

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,640
we can take one or two more um a couple

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,680
of them are i think are easy responses

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,599
in the q a

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,359
uh someone asked what about the overall

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,800
problem of multiple projects all trying

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,319
to do the same thing shouldn't we be

00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,240
focused on one or two projects in each

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:43,040
domain they're well supported

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,240
i have so much i can say to that problem

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,319
um

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,079
um yes yes we should be focusing on

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,079
reducing the amount of duplicated effort

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,160
in the open source ecosystem it is it is

00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,079
a big problem in and of itself

00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,000
um uh how do

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,680
the the last question i think i'd like

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,800
us to take is how do we rise to the

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,400
challenge and say no

00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,040
and and and set boundaries um uh and in

00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,200
particular

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,280
helping maintainers to set good

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,400
boundaries for themselves so that they

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,079
can

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,000
uh uh avoid pushback and and

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,920
and effectively sort of have their have

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,800
the work-life balance that they want

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,880
i think a thing that can help uh is

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,520
setting clear expectations for the

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,400
project

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,079
in the project um in uh both your

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,839
contributing documentation and

00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,079
the other artifacts that are available

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,839
for the document make it clear

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,119
what the scope of the project is what

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,640
you're willing to accept what you're not

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,920
willing to accept what your working

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,480
hours are

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,040
um we know not everybody will read these

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,319
things

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,920
but there it can help to

00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:51,280
set a a set of guidelines for how you're

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,720
minute i'll i'll give a final note which

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,960
is that if

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,119
if you have an open source project and

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,400
you know there is an organization

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,160
that uses that project check and see if

00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,760
they have an open source program office

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,400
they're usually public about that and if

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,319
they do

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,520
and you need help reach out to them and

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,240
ask for help

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,359
like we are here within the open source

00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,200
program office world

00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,960
specifically looking for you and looking

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,440
for ways to help support you

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,880
