	00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,740
so then which wonder at the ancient

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,560
world had the best JavaScript web

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:16,710
application I don't care the Hanging

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:19,590
Gardens of Babylon hey there I sure yet

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,410
been this is jay absolutely we're going

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,869
to talk about deploying static from 10

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,439
sites and different things we like about

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,849
that so yeah yeah I think this is

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,710
something there's lots of things out

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,210
there for like back end of you know and

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,290
heroic you type things but sometimes

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,210
when there's a front-end project can be

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,739
a little more you know things like a

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,290
Roku don't work for that so there's a

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,719
few other options week and we can use so

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,690
I think my favorite thing is get out

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,250
pages right like this is just super easy

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,050
to get started and very open and come

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,750
back you can use all the requests to get

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,039
you content yeah and one things I really

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,129
like about get our bigger side with my

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,859
blog on github pages and every any kind

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,260
of so the main blog is on github pages

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,350
but any other kind of test repository

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,360
that I've got you can access as a sub

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:12,570
directory of my blog yes so as soon as I

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,720
put up like food as a repository if I

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,270
haven't H pages branch lap and activists

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,390
at desa that's really cool ya sure ya do

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,650
it yeah I see how that works cool so for

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,180
instance if I've got this repository

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,970
called pages bash them over on my my

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,159
blog the angle / pages / devil food i

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,960
smell I get that content and what's

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,790
really cool is as soon as I push up a

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,360
change so I can edit it in place here

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,770
and some changes to bar and then commit

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,829
those changes as soon as those changes

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,869
get pushed up they go into my github

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,159
pages yeah after a few minutes so

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,890
sometimes it takes I can maybe about

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,110
like 20 30 seconds this will update the

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,710
bar look at that look at that that's

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,659
really cool and it's just I really like

00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,850
lightweight flexible way of doing it

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,740
yeah I think I didn't get how pages

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,299
along yeah I heard my blog in it too and

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,030
it's great for I've had a couple of

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,619
people contribute posts or fixes to blog

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,360
posts and the way they can just pull a

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,400
question to get hub is it's brilliant

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,710
they don't charge for getting pages and

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,660
which is amazing

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,240
even for larger sites they don't they

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,370
don't kind of ask for money or anything

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,310
yeah it's amazing my favorite we get is

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,050
a really great tool for trapping content

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,150
right like not just cold so the ice so

00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,130
no expect to see how some content has

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:32,720
changed over time yeah yeah we use our

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,830
crab or no yes you've been using yeah

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,990
this is a new thing I've come across

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,430
called surge which I think as a tool has

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,980
been around for a little bit not too

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,960
long and all this is really easy way to

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,700
just take a folder on your computer and

00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,710
just chuck it at some random URL and

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,840
that's it in a nutshell so doesn't use

00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,000
get it literally takes whatever folder

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,670
you run it in and just puts it on a

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,640
random URL and that's it so to sleep

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,020
like yeah really really lightweight cool

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,230
so I mean I'm in this directory called

00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,270
foo it's just got an index.html file it

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,710
just says hello world in it and if I

00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,570
want I want to put this online I can

00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,390
just run surge which is you just install

00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,800
through mpm I just sign up for an

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,120
account bits and tiny Frida's do so I

00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,240
haven't give them any card details or

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,160
anything I hit surge so it fills in my

00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,840
kind of email and stuff and then it asks

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,250
me for the path for what folder on to

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,370
deploy so I just used this current

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,500
folder and I hit and it'll pick a random

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,830
domain but you can give it your own name

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,560
if you want to but now I've done that I

00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:34,970
can just grab this URL here and copy it

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,040
and go into chrome and paste it and I've

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,320
now got that site up right now which is

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,940
just amazing and really quick effortless

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,550
it's not even get so you don't see the

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,380
get commits and stuff and and and also

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,880
if I you know if I were to just change

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,950
that file all I have to do is rerun

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,240
surge just use the same domain name that

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,950
I've already used previously and it'll

00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,080
just overwrite so it's it's kind of like

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,940
dumb copy and paste if you like but it

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,380
works perfectly for kind of front end

00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,720
only projects where there's no sirven as

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,930
a bunch of static stuff highly recommend

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,480
at surge SH to get started he should

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,390
yeah okay sorry yeah get started three

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,700
eggs them one of the things I guess is

00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:14,090
cool about that like I find with github

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,640
pages when I'm transpiring from whatever

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,890
to something else you've got to commit

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,600
it into your jammies whereas research

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,520
because it's just a for you I guess you

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,660
can have your right

00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,520
yeah absolutely that's what I've done

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,500
you build into a subdirectory which is

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,370
the the thing you push on to surge yeah

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,780
let's ring I see ya and you're going to

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,750
translation start right transpiring and

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,420
bundling and concatenate minifying all

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,130
of them I love it yeah yeah because as

00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,110
we having the discussion earlier we

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,080
can't write plain old JavaScript anymore

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,360
apparently not right yeah but you're a

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:52,130
fan of kind of keeping it lean and not

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,600
transpiring yeah like so we both like

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,520
Buble right like I mean I think that's

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,730
really kind lightweight transform thing

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,260
I like knowing by telling transforming

00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,880
arrow functions until I yeah any

00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,440
different syntax and stuff but as soon

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,700
as it gets like beyond that I I kind of

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,370
feel like I've lost control of my cold

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,080
or something yeah or I don't know it

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,330
just makes me feel uncomfortable I think

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,790
so you've got you've got Buble which is

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,830
the lightweight compiler transpiler by

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,100
rich harris which does a very kind of

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,420
defined subset of the es2015 so Babel

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,770
can be configured to transpile

00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,180
everything ever and everything ever and

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,860
it does things like generators and the

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,380
more complex he has 2015 features

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,090
whereas Buble is just a very defined

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,650
kind of the more I guess we call them

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,870
straightforward transforms like our

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,780
functions into just function expressions

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,370
and D structuring into and so on and so

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,390
forth what's really cool actually the

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,669
moment as well as we're seeing in

00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,980
certain environments we don't need those

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,380
tools anymore like chrome support for

00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,210
yes 2015 is pretty good edge your

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,280
support for yes turn 15 is very good as

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,770
well so we're getting to a point now

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,910
actually we're yes if you want to just

00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,290
blindly use every feature without

00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:01,010
considering the Browns that you should

00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,540
use Babel able but if you just say if

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,820
you like really like our functions which

00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,620
I know you are a particular advocate of

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,300
then you might be in a position soon

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,710
where you can just use them because they

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,990
use as your targeting on the browser's

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,190
they're on may well support it like

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,140
we're not quite there I don't think but

00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,140
you know we are edging towards that

00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:20,360
direction which is really cool beer and

00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,860
then then you come on to bundling which

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,260
is just another thing to deal with you

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:28,280
got like webpack browserify roll up

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,050
pulse by rich heiress JSP em there's a

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,110
ton of options you're not

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,150
there's a new version or something yeah

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,800
there's a Jess p.m. northpointe 17 which

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,590
kind of the next big release which is

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,960
currently in beta which I'm talking on a

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,720
couple of events coming up soon but Jess

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,849
p.m. is kind of the aims to be the one

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,379
tool you need to do all your bundling

00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:51,229
and minification and package management

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:53,060
on client-side applications so it will

00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:56,240
install things for it for you and then

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,069
kind of hookup babble so the translation

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,009
just works for you and then it will

00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:02,659
bundle those all together for you it can

00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:05,000
do basically everything it aims to be in

00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:06,500
this world of people getting dragged

00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,210
down by like 20 different tools they

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,759
need to build their website Jesse Owens

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,319
aims to be that one that slots in I

00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,360
think it's really cool i'm sure i'll be

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,830
blogging about it soon it's it's still

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,930
in beta the new version so there are a

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,909
couple of rough edges but the non beta

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,050
version has been around for a good few

00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:22,460
years now I've used it all previous

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,860
projects and it's it's really nothing to

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,479
look into if you don't want to have to

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,430
like compose lots of tools together and

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,840
just want one thing to build your client

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,599
setup with I think Jess p.m. is a really

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,440
good choice cool what's your what's your

00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,000
go-to I would like that and I think I've

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,520
always going to go on with the way that

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,810
you cannot define those transforms or

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,330
files like I feel like it kind of makes

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,520
quite a lot of sense so I tend to use

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,469
that a lot of products but then again as

00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,800
we're talking about a while ago it's

00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:53,900
just like I I really dislike the amount

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,300
of stuff I have to install just to kind

00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,400
of convert a sass file into a CSS yeah

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,319
we know it's like when you've got all

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,680
these different plugins and former full

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,729
of dependencies yeah no huge fan but

00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,409
yeah I think that's where people get

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,270
stuck with web pack as well because web

00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:11,930
pack is it's very very powerful and it's

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,699
great but it does everything and web

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,050
pack will do javascript will do CSS or

00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,659
do images will do absolutely everything

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,919
employees so it's very easy to kind of

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:20,060
put yourself into a corner with web pack

00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:21,620
where you've no idea what's going on but

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,539
if you build from scratch and web pack

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,940
is a really good tool especially with

00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:28,900
the like live reloading and watching and

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,729
small builds kind of rebuilds built-in

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,550
cool and one of things I've been going

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:36,469
into zai using package scripts like so

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,390
impacts Jason to find script things and

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,460
just saying just using

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,020
really basic commands to kind of getting

00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,240
stuff across and think of that so that's

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,490
been something I think that might be a

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,920
nice alternative possibly i'm still not

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,240
over there yeah i think i'm a fan of

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,590
that too but then you get back to the

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,200
problem of having like seven different

00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,610
things installed just to have this

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,850
combination of scripts that will build

00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,440
your entire project like yeah we're not

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,670
quite there yet like you go if the

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,020
things if you pick one tool that does it

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,700
all that's great until you need to maybe

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,900
configure it slightly differently but if

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,310
you pick lots of little ones you have

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,570
full control but then you have more

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,950
chances and breaking and they're a bit

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,260
more brittle and then you have to do a

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,370
bit more work so it's it's whichever one

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,780
you're more comfortable if I think and

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,850
what level of control you need you

00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,200
usually have an HTML file in development

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,760
that might load in a few different

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,560
script tags and a few different CSS

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,060
things because in development you don't

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,530
care about the extra requests and stuff

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,540
you just want to kind of build your

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,680
application then in production you're

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,080
probably gonna take those like four

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,580
script tags and merge them into one and

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,930
you probably going to take your for CSS

00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,820
files again show them into one or

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,380
whatever you might do and then so what

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,820
you need is you then need another HTML

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,560
file that you'll actually push to

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,420
production that has the script tag just

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,490
to your bundle JavaScript and similar

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,400
for your CSS or maybe your inlining some

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,260
successors will will come on to and you

00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,790
can just manually create this this new

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,400
HTML file but then the problem is if you

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,690
add say a new give to your development

00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,460
HTML file you have to remember to

00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,620
replicate that in your production HTML

00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,900
file because the two need to be in sync

00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,510
other than the the scripts and the CSS

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,700
is that being bundled during deployment

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,740
so I built a talk with HTML disc which

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,660
can manipulate HTML files basically so

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,310
will include a link and love any

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,260
feedback on it but effectively takes one

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,850
HTML file you write a kind of config

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,860
file that that can transform it into

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,840
another so it's a way of automating the

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,960
HTML sign of your deployments as well as

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,730
your JavaScript and CSS it sounds great

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,860
like oh yeah well I've checked out right

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,810
ladies gonna think it's quite

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:31,790
interesting a promise to yeah thanks

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,250
yeah so I guess when they're having some

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,010
you may difference is a in line in CSS

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,320
or whether it's less like I'm one of the

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,630
kind of classic ways or using your own

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,780
process to

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,670
your front end whirlpool is usually per

00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,550
semester request rate smell and then

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,380
they can start looking through that and

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,640
they'll find the style with three and

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,790
they have to make another request to go

00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,890
to do that yeah but one way of reducing

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:00,850
that extra round trip which can cause a

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:02,950
lot of lag is to kind of inline that CSS

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,530
from that file yeah so that's something

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:08,590
that's kind of cool with Bill processor

00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:11,290
I guess that changes HP to potentially

00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:14,200
actually I think people addy Osmani

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,450
refers as the critical path CSS same

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,700
kind of idea yeah but rather than the

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,740
whole style sheet that critical path

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,360
approach is taking busy rendering your

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,860
page seeing what's important and taking

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,830
those styles and enlighten them it's a

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,520
lattice I think yes yeah so Anna meeting

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:32,980
room on the CSS which okay pipe in some

00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,230
HTML and then it will kind of find out

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,420
which selectors are used Oh pulsing pull

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,310
out from your CSS file which is nice

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,020
that's really cool yeah alright so the

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,320
round off we're going to do our any

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:47,080
other business part of the show and so

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,420
do you wanna start John do us yeah yeah

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,360
so I've got a couple of bits of it any

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:56,080
other business yeah and first of all

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,140
school and ventricle where we're both

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,840

those are some awesome talks there so

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,890
you should definitely check those out

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,210
yeah it was a great couple of days yeah

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:14,380
it was a great couple days and like that

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,050
properly special yeah yeah and yeah the

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,600
other thing that I be working on at the

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,340
moment is so I earn this helper in a

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,560
series of events of an awkward cold

00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,160
summer pass and these are like half

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,840
these we run in the community and

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,610
they're brilliant either really great

00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,980
day since we just put summer hacks a new

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,320
person slight cold new version with new

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,110
events for this year and that's really

00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,110
great nice sort of hats Ohio quit and

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,540
tickets a bizarre up tickets are going

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,730
fast I have a tiny bit of any other

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,720
business and I want to give a plug to

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,870
addy Osmani talk at Google i/o which was

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,550
in the last week which was on

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,019
progressive web apps but across all

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,850
framework so we seen a lot from google

00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,410
on this progressive web apps idea but

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,720
very specifically normally building like

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,939
a small apple using like polymer which

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,470
is a you know google product but in this

00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:06,149
talk addy takes an existing web app

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,310
though in react then one in ember and

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:09,990
then want an angular 2 and turns them

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,449
each into a progressive web app so it's

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,100
really great to see like i think people

00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:15,360
kind of hit progressive web apps with

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,920
the stick of well this only works for

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,410
new applications that built-in it's very

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,550
specific way but addy very well you know

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,079
does a great job of demonstrating that

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,699
that's not the case at all so yeah

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,639
that's that's what we've got to say on

00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:29,160
that so yeah you got any comments or if

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,240
you like have anything to add yeah or

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,759
let's put any more links in the show

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,370
notes and yeah drop us a message and

00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:40,759
