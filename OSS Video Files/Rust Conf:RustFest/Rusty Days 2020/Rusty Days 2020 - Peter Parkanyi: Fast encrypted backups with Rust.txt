Zerostash is a deduplicated and encrypted file storage format that is optimized for speed.

The talk will walk through the problem domain, the design decisions that were influenced directly by the need for speed for tools like this, and how to reduce synchronization latency in for remote or p2p sync.

The listeners will learn about how backup software generally works, and where the design tradeoffs lie when designing a storage layer. In addition, they get some insights into generic Rust optimization tricks and gotchas:

* Reducing the number of copies
* Slicing a slice will reduce performance
* LTO
* inlining
* reducing code size on the hot path
* threads and pipelining
* trusting the operating system
* using vectorization for the costliest things
