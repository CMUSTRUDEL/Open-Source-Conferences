Is Rust ready for mainstream usage in backend development?

There is a lot of buzz around web frameworks while many other (critical!) Day 2 concerns do not get nearly as much attention.

We will discuss observability: do the tools currently available in the Rust ecosystem cover most of your telemetry needs?

I will walk you through our journey here at TrueLayer when we built our first production backend system in Rust, Donate Direct.

We will be touching on the state of Rust tooling for logging, metrics and distributed tracing.
