While high-level advantages of functional programming and algebraic data structures in comparison to object-oriented programming are quite well known in the Rust community, numerous low-level advantages are not as commonly mentioned. While some programming languages use the functional approach as a means of optimization, Rust optimizes the very tools the functional paradigm is built upon.

In this talk, I want to present how Rust's approach to basic data structures (products/structs and coproducts/enums) is different from that of most functional programming languages. Further, I want to illustrate how low-level optimization is performed, which makes it possible, and what can be improved even further depending on how the language evolves.
