Have you flown a drone? What about writing Rust? Let me tell you about our efforts to hack on a drone using Rust and build a demo project that will showcase some practical capabilities.

The drone we are using has a couple of ways you can communicate with. We are focusing our efforts on the WiFi (UDP) communication and decoding the Frames used by the drone using the open-source C SDK provided by the manufacturer.

We will share with you what were the hurdles we've encountered as well as what we are planning for the future of the project.
