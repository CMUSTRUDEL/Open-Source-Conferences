The Rust compiler's borrow checker is critical for ensuring safe Rust code. Even more critical, however, is how the borrow checker provides useful, automated guidance on how to write safe code when the check fails. 

Early in your Rust journey, it may feel like you are fighting the borrow checker. Come to this talk to learn how you can transition from fighting the borrow checker to using its guidance to write safer and more powerful code at any experience level. Walk away not only understanding the what and the how of the borrow checker - but why it works the way it does - and why it is so critical to both the technical functionality and philosophy of Rust.
