At Mozilla, Firefox is not the only product we ship. Many others — including a variety of smartphone applications, and certainly not just web browsers — are built by various teams across the organization. These applications are composed of a multitude of libraries which, when possible, are reused across platforms.

In the past year we used Rust to rebuild one of these libraries: the library powering the telemetry in our mobile applications is now integrated into Android and iOS applications and will soon be powering our Desktop platforms as well.

This talk will showcase how this small team managed to create a cross-platform Rust library, and ship it to a bunch of platforms all at once.
