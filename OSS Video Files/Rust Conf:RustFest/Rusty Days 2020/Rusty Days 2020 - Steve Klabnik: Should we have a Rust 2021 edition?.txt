In 2018, Rust adopted an "edition" system. This lets Rust evolve in ways that feel like breaking changes but are opt-in only, and that do not disturb the open-source ecosystem. Given that Rust 2018 happened three years after the initial 2015 release of Rust, this has everyone wondering: is 2021 the year we have our next edition?

In this talk, Steve lays out his own feelings on this question, as well as talks about the history of the edition system, how it works, and what it might look like in 2021.
