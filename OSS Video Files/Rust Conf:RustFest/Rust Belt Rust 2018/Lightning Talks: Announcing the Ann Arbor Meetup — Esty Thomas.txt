all right yesterday I got some excellent

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,160
advice from someone I have forgotten who

00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,800
it was if it was you then you can stand

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,869
up and take credit about how to make

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,960
meetups happen and make meetups keep

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:25,759
happening that advice is useful to

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,960
people who are not in Ann Arbor as well

00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:32,720
the advice is to start simple pick a

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,960
consistent time in place always show up

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,460
even if you're the only person there

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,410
don't get disappointed if people don't

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,320
start coming back for like a year

00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:45,680
because people are hard to get to do

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,780
things with that in mind I have chosen a

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,460
time and a place and a cadence for Ann

00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:53,840
Arbor rest meetups they will be

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,850
happening on the 4th Wednesday of every

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,890
month that way I avoid Thanksgiving this

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,070
year next month

00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:11,570
interesting ones maybe at first I don't

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,510
know if anyone is going to subsidize

00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,670

00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,620

00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,979
if someone is inspired to do a talk or

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:27,440
