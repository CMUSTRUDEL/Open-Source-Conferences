Title: Maintaining the Rust Community — Arshia Mufti
Publication date: 2018-11-28
Playlist: Rust Belt Rust 2018
Description: 
	While many newcomers to Rust come from a systems background, a significant number of them adopt Rust as their first ever systems programming language. Why is this so? In this talk, Arshia explores the components of the Rust community and ecosystem that encourage participation, the implications of a rapidly growing Rust community, and how we can continue to maintain our accessibility and inclusivity in the face of this growth.

all of you are really good clappers

00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:27,180
listen if you're ever gonna clap for a

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:28,529
speaker like only once ever clap at the

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,419
start of their talk so they'll feel

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,739
really great at the end of their talk

00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,489
all they're gonna think about is the

00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,340
fact that they don't have to talk

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,770
anymore so it matters for just just not

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,780
as much anyways I digress we're at the

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,960
beginning of my talk so hello everyone

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,749
my name is archaea and i am a member on

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,489
the community team at rest I'm taking a

00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:50,309
bit of a break but when I was on it I

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,309
helped run the rust bridge events who

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,379
here knows what rust bridge is oh wow

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,539
okay because I had this whole spiel but

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,429
I don't okay I'm just gonna say it

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,530
anyways so rust bridge is this all-day

00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:03,659
workshop an introductory workshop to

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,739
rust lank and this is geared towards

00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,870
people who are underrepresented in

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,640
technology so we run these all the

00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,350
workshops and get them started with the

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,900
rest language but also the rest

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,760
ecosystem and I've helped run it twice

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,040
and I sometimes contribute towards

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,900
improvements in the curriculum so that's

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,630
me and today I'm going to talk about

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,850
this idea that I really want to credit

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,700
Carol with which is maintaining the rust

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,800
community and I've been thinking

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,900
increasingly I've attended to response

00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,700
and just watching them change over the

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,380
past few years has been really

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,110
interesting and it's really made me

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,870
think about how at this stage of sort of

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,870
the history of rust changes are

00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:45,150
happening so fast and we really want to

00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,980
maintain our community in the face of

00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,300
those changes and I've been thinking

00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,780
about you know the challenges that we

00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,980
face as these changes come up so that's

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,440
what my what my talk is gonna be about

00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,410
but I want to start off hang on how do I

00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,090
switch slides important question okay

00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,880
figuring it out I want to start off with

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,700
a story a story about me and how I got

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,300
started off in rust so way way way way

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,640
way back in 2017 I'm in my 20s so 2017

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,970
feels like forever ago so much has

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,980
happened in early 2017 I attended this

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,959
conference that was keynoted by Ashley

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,940
who spoke at the the keynote this

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,100
morning and she talked about this

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,430
teaching operating system called interim

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,290
ethos or Intermezzo s in the spa

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,989
little language called rust I was like

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,340
oh this is fun because at that time I

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,280
was taking an operating systems class

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,329
and I was loving the heck of it I you

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,219
know I was learning about like page

00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:40,709
tables and device drivers and schedulers

00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,569
I I loved all that stuff and I really

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,719
wanted to get better at it and you know

00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,579
sort of explore this in a greater depth

00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:50,670
and really get into this field and

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:51,989
really get good at everything related to

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,480
operating systems and systems

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,980
programming in general the problem was

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,019
that something got in my way and that

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,389
something was this language that I was

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,579
using to implement my assignments before

00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:07,319
to implement syscalls like fork and exit

00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:09,060
and so on in C and I not to hold extreme

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,069
opinions about programming languages and

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,680
I don't hold an extreme opinion about C

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:15,780
but the fact was that C felt like it was

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,370
actively getting in my way like C had

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,680
this agenda against me and she was like

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,659
no you want to learn about an operating

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,609
system well sucks for you because I'm

00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,519
just not gonna let you let you get to

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:27,870
that point and so like I understood that

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,430
learning C and learning assembly would

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,229
be a bit of a steep learning curve and

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,150
sort of I was trying to figure out if it

00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:34,470
was worth it right steep learning curves

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,239
are great because they challenge you

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,829
they encourage you to push yourself but

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,930
you want to pick your curves you can't

00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,190
just pick every curve ever and climb all

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,400
of them it's just not physically

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,040
possible um and and I sort of explored

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,349
beyond C 2 right I looked into Linux and

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,269
distributed systems and just sort of all

00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,560
the communities that sort of surround C

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,530
which are like grounded in low-level

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,629
programming and it made me realize that

00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,459
even if I mastered the language what

00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:01,680
would get in my way after that would be

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,139
the culture and the environment that

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,549
surrounded these technologies and I

00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,280
really felt like I didn't want to fight

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:09,659
for a place in those spaces and I think

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,099
we can all agree I'm not really gonna

00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,599
try to convince you you can listen to

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,849
Ashley's talk she does try to convince

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,139
you a little bit that a community is

00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:18,930
centered around low-level programming

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,669
can be pretty gatekeeping and I just

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:24,090
didn't have time for that I was

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:26,220
like okay and so I like Chuck trusts

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,650
into this bucket of things like knitting

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,360
and like baking and all the things that

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,130
I wanted to get really good at but I was

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,870
like nah it's like just not gonna happen

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,259
for me and I'm just okay with that in my

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,300
life

00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,680
but back to the keynote so I was

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,539
listening to this keynote and like

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,900
looking up this operating system and

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,300
looking

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,370
rust and I thought this seems like this

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,780
could really work for me it has all

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,419
these like high-level constructs that I

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,490
already am familiar with that I knew

00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,740
from other languages that I could see

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,440
would make me a better programmer it had

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,810
this compiler that you know said that it

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,850
would enforce you know my invariants for

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,520
me that would provide sanity checks for

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,070
me and would really sort of help me and

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,780
guide me as I program and it made me

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,050
feel like okay this is this is something

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,360
that I could work on but it wasn't easy

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,520
right once I got the basics down it felt

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,960
like a really steep learning curve there

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,180
was a straight system that I thought I

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,350
understood but I didn't really and in

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,060
the borrowed checker that I thought I

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,919
understood but then I didn't really and

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,229
then once I got past that there was like

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,240
a sink i/o and like lifetimes and like

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:29,100
ref cells I think if I ever complain

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,199
about rust I'll just save Repsol because

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,199
for me specifically this has been just

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,840
like a like a pain point for me so like

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,940
it wasn't easy right but this curve felt

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,620
like it was worth it and the reason that

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,120
it felt like it was worth it was because

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,460
of the way that rust was introduced to

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,620
me which was that my introduction to

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,070
rust was was devoid of any sort of

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,570
expectation that I had to have I had to

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,280
have like programmed in some language

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,720
for some number of years or that I

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,099
needed some certain kind of background

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,320
to be successful and rest

00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:00,690
sidenote the only side note I will ever

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,090
make in this talk I feel like this idea

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,310
that we perpetuate that to be a

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,260
successful programmer takes anything

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,539
more than just focus in practice like

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,970
you need some inherent magical skill to

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,699
be a good programmer is one of the most

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,620
isolating scams in tech its an isolating

00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,389
scam no just a scam it's an isolating

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,280
scam and it's it's so awful and we

00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,570
should do everything we can just sort of

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,529
counter that mess

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:29,589
thank you

00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:34,479
oh no I'm going to rant more now nothing

00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:35,859
you clap for me um okay but this was

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,989
this was my introduction to rest and

00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:40,869
over the over the next year as I talk to

00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:42,879
people on Twitter and as I talked to you

00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:45,219
know my peers people as respiration ents

00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,079
I learned that my experience wasn't that

00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,639
unique that a lot of people had this

00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,289
exact same experience with rust where

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,149
they they heard of it they tried it out

00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:54,099
they picked it up they liked it they hit

00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:56,439
a wall but they wanted to keep pushing

00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:59,439
at that wall um and that really

00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,119
interested me and I really feel like for

00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,379
many people who start off programming in

00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,059
rust I know there's a fair number of

00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,219
people who are experienced and come in

00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:08,259
from C++ because they've had their fair

00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:10,479
share grief from those languages but a

00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,369
lot of people want to understand systems

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,879
and they pick rust as their first

00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:17,769
systems language so two things that

00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,399
really made me want to stick with rust

00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:23,259
the first was this idea that this gut

00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,629
feeling that the rust community felt

00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:28,299
very intentionally constructed to be

00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,649
inclusive and and keep in mind this is

00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:32,110
like I didn't know anyone in rust at the

00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,639
time all I had was you know access to

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,729
like their github their issue tracker

00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,469
and like you know any online resources

00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:40,509
that I could see I didn't personally

00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:42,009
know anyone in rust but there were so

00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:43,629
many big and little things about dress

00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:46,119
that I encountered like the language

00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:48,339
used in the official book the code of

00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:51,429
conduct the way that issue triage was

00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,769
done and I like used Twitter a lot and

00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,809
so do rest people it turns out that was

00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:57,039
like really great for me and so all

00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,229
these little things made me feel like

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,619
there was a lot of care put into sort of

00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:05,619
the construction of this community the

00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:07,599
second was that in 2017 rust was kind of

00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:09,489
new not like super new like I know it

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,429
was post 1.0 but it felt kind of new to

00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:14,469
me and many communities are new they

00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:17,079
have a very different kind of potential

00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:18,639
there in this like uncharted territory

00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,039
and all these like decisions have to be

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,349
made that are hugely relevant to the

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,939
future of that community and to me a

00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:26,919
community is really all about its people

00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:28,539
right the people who choose to join the

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,199
people who choose to leave the people

00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:34,409
who choose to stay and this challenge of

00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:36,610
creating a programming community

00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,370
creating this program the community of

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,919
programmers

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,690
who reject gatekeeping who value

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,339
mentorship programmers who don't all

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,350
look like each other it's such a hard

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,240
challenge and I really wanted to be in a

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,370
community in which that challenged and

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,680
feel insurmountable and so rust was

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,450
small and rust was new and rust showed

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,210
me that it was taking some positive

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,000
steps in that direction and so rust made

00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,890
me want to stay and this was like the

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,980
beginning of my like for a interests

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:06,080
right but as I as I you know

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,550
participated more in the rust community

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,040
got to know people who were in the

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,410
working groups lurked around in RFC's a

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,940
lot I could see that this instinct that

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,070
I had about this intentional

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,540
construction it's like so funny how they

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,339
open in keynote talked about like being

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,120
delivered and I was like oh my god I'm

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:24,080
talking about intentional construction

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,779
it's like it's very nice how they're

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,520
complimentary in that way yeah I could

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,920
see how this like instinct I had about

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,770
intentional construction ended up being

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,720
really true because this this approach

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,160
was baked into a lot of the norms and a

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,040
lot of the processes in the rust

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,709
community and just a simple example of

00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,330
this I think is the RFC process and I

00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,700
know all of you can think of like your

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,650
favorite like contentious RFC oh my god

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,350
RFC five two nine eight like it never

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:53,330
got closed etc and I know the RFC

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,760
process isn't perfect but what I want to

00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:59,120
talk about is how I feel like the core

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,370
team has evolved the RFC process because

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,810
they want to keep its alignment with the

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,029
goals of thrust which is to be open

00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,320
which is to listen to the rest community

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:09,230
which is to incorporate their feedback

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,620
and really you know create this culture

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,470
of trust and so I heard about this as I

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,910
was like sort of researching this talk

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,410
where a few years ago there was a lot of

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,720
frustration within the rest community

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,510
where they felt like decisions were made

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,790
in RFC's based off of rationale that

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,589
wasn't publicly expressed in threads and

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,510
so they were like hey what the hell man

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:31,040
like we didn't know about this and you

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,370
just went off and made this decision on

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,620
your own

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,120
and so the core team like really

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,130
listened and really came back and said

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,770
we have this new rule where if we make a

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,180
decision it will be based off of you

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,270
know public debate and threads that

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,390
everyone can see and comment on and I

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:49,760
just thought that was a really really

00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,320
really profound example and as I was

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,210
researching this more I came across

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,350
across this quote on aaron's website and

00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,060
I'm gonna read the whole quote out to

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,580
you because that is how his words should

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,350
be treated sometimes the rest community

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,540
prides itself on being a friendly and

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,490
welcoming place but it is going to take

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,230
constant explicit work to keep it that

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,300
way and part of that work is being

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,580
forthright about the cases where things

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,580
have gone less than friendly pausing and

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,340
working together to figure out why so

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:23,390
the reason I love this quote so much yes

00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:25,370
thank you the reason I love this quote

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,710
so much is that it doesn't even just

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,960
apply to the ihcs dislike applies to so

00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:33,350
much more than it applies to sort of the

00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,150
overall culture interest and as someone

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,190
who isn't like I'm not on the core team

00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,780
I'm not in a working group I don't I'm

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,310
in school I'm like really not

00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,410
contributing to rest open source a lot

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,870
so I have a very different view of the

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,660
rest community and I want to argue that

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,280
these top-level decisions this approach

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,020
that you see at the top level of the

00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,730
rest community has this sort of like

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,980
trickle-down effects that you can see

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,540
and so it has a positive impact on the

00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,760
experience of someone who's only been

00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,470
doing rust for a few hours or for a few

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,160
days and I think that's really great

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:06,110
about the rest community but this is

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,460
only going to get harder not saying it

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,080
hasn't been hard yet it's been pretty

00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,600
hard though the whole keynote this

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,310
morning was about how things are not

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,130
easy people are hard and working with

00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,930
them is like a non-trivial challenge but

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,000
I think that as more and more people

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:24,050
start writing rust we're going to face

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,290
some new challenges the first challenge

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,940
has to do with our values right so I

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,950
feel like rust has a pretty simple set

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,530
of values and we've done a fairly good

00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,510
job of like articulating them at least

00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:37,190
you know no gatekeeping celebrating our

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,590
differences instead of using them as

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,990
grounds for inclusion discouraging

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,810
zero-sum thinking encouraging humility

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,460
and empathy and so on

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,290
but I feel like as the community grows

00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,240
it is going to be harder to defuse these

00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,770
values and spread this message to

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,720
everyone who decides to start

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,980
programming and rest and I was telling

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,380
this to my friend yesterday and she was

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:01,310
like this is like when you put a skittle

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,990
in the water I was like what so so

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,150
apparently when you put a skittle in the

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,920
water the color will like

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,600
out of it and it'll go into the water

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,670
and diffuse to the water but it won't be

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,310
even like you know like when you have a

00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:14,600
drop of ink in the water or something

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,370
you can see that the color is like the

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,900
most intense at the center and then it

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,810
just gets like less and less intense

00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,940
around the periphery so what I'm really

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,730
saying is that our rust values are like

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,790
the colors of skittles in this like

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,200
weird analogy so the growth of a

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,880
community is a great thing right like

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,100
it's good that people are adopting rust

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,780
more and more but I think along with

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,850
that growth we have to think about how

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,100
we are communicating our values because

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,050
subgroups and and sub communities and

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,640
pockets will inevitably form but we

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,470
really want to do all that we can to

00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,840
make sure that those pockets are

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:52,430
grounded in these these basic values of

00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,380
kindness and consideration and I was

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,610
talking about this with with Minnie

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,680
she's like a lot of people have you know

00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,420
brainstorm just like talk with me and he

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,520
pointed out that it's worth thinking

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,560
about how the rest community is changing

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,200
now as opposed to a few years ago and

00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,270
the rest community is no longer just a

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,850
group of people who like really really

00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:13,370
like memory safe programming languages

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,800
or whatever you know it's a mature

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,690
community that plenty of businesses and

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,310
organizations have you know derived

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,980
value out of like commercial value out

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,960
of and this is great but this means that

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,450
plenty of newcomers to the language are

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,500
learning rust I mean a lot of them are

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,720
learning rust out of self-interest

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,760
because they really think that you know

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,200
they're really excited by this new model

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,690
of like memory management or something

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,310
but a lot of them are also starting to

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,990
program in rust because they happen to

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,790
join a company in which the code base is

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,530
in rust or they're starting to work on a

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,980
project on you know which is written in

00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:48,350
rust and so on and this means that it is

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,730
entirely possible that people who start

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,250
programming in rust will not necessarily

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,840
aligned with our values they might they

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,550
might in fact disagree with our values

00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,420
and be like all right I'm gonna program

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,560
in rust they're not gonna care etc and I

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,450
think that has really interesting

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,460
implications for the composition of our

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,990
community moving forward and it's just

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,470
really important to keep that in mind

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:11,240
and understand that dynamic the second

00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,450
set of challenges I think we're gonna

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,040
face is that of diversity so like I

00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,810
actually want to want to ask all of you

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,100
how many of you think that with respect

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,750
to like other community

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,810
rust does like a really good job of

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,190
encouraging participation yeah you like

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,140
I do too that's great

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,380
how many of you feel like that's still

00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,670
not good enough okay great I'm really

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,190
glad I don't have to like do the work

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,630
it's like convincing all of you um and

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,670
the state of the rust survey provides

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,760
some pretty good data as to this as well

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:43,190
this is data from 2017 and according to

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,740
the the rust website pretty much look

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,790
like this in 2016 as well and it's

00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,650
something that you'll notice if you

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,170
start to attend a lot of rust events

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:53,840
which I do which is that we're a pretty

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,310
homogenous group and it would be pretty

00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,500
unfortunate if yours from now we

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,350
continue to stay this homogeneous I

00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,350
think that would really upset me and it

00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:06,470
would you know it wouldn't make for a

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,330
healthy participation but it's also

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,160
useful to think about like how did we

00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,380
get here like what happened like we

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,760
started off like as a little you know

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,410
what was the keynote like in the

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,880
beginning there was the void and then

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,580
like rust happened and then people

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,670
started joining um and how did we get

00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:25,280
here like n years later well there's two

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,410
reasons I think the first is that rust

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,830
is primarily a systems programming

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:34,010
language and systems has such a legacy

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:36,260
you know starting from like the 70s or

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,690
the 60s or whatever and that does tend

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,870
to skew towards the the white male

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,310
demographic for another open-source

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,890
communities themselves aren't very

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,930
diverse because being able to commit the

00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,150
time and energy that you need to

00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,550
actively and you know impactfully

00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,920
contribute to a community is something

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,180
that not everyone can do and I was

00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,560
thinking about this during the opening

00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,780
keynote where there was this idea that

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,850
you know his like over the past year or

00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,310
so and rest we've moved really fast and

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,920
that's been really good for us but that

00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,300
that's come at a cost and I think I

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,829
would like to argue that one of the

00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:15,459
costs that we've had to pay is the

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:15,459
diversity of our community thank you

00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,370
so so I feel like we're at this like

00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:24,110
inflection point where we're not so big

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,450
that it's going it's this mammoth

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,760
completely impossible task to make our

00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:31,100
community more diverse but we're big

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,720
enough that if we don't think of new

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,940
concrete ways of addressing the problem

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,320
it will soon become much harder than it

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:41,000
is right now and I'm and I've been

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,530
thinking about like ways we can address

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,390
this like I don't want this talk to just

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,470
be a dump of like everything sucks and

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,750
we don't know what to do

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,420
and I've been thinking about this idea

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,920
of points of entry into rust like the

00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,920
ways that people enter the rest

00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,730
community um so like I said I run these

00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,140
rust bridge I've run to rest bridge

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,030
workshops over the past year and

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,040
something that I've noticed is that a

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,720
lot of the people who come to rest have

00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,610
a significant amount of experience in

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,250
some other language like Java or

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,660
JavaScript and so on so naturally when

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,070
they start to learn rust

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,830
they'll try to map what they know in

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,600
those languages to rust and they'll do

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,160
this even for features of rust you know

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,860
that don't necessarily have an analogue

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,960
like the burrow checker and so on so

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,690
what we need is more resources that say

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,030
hey you you have this super valuable and

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,100
super useful experience let's use that

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:34,010
to get you started with rust instead of

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,690
starting them off with like oh this is

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,980
the way garbage collection is even

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,660
though you don't know like even though

00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,300
you've come from like this language that

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,620
doesn't have garbage collection at all

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,810
and we were talking about this a few

00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,120
weeks ago just before I took a break

00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:49,340
from the community team and we were

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,200
thinking of this idea of modifying the

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,180
respite curriculum where we have code

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,280
examples for concepts like enums and

00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,570
optionals and so on in common languages

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,880
that people typically know like

00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,430
JavaScript or Java and we provide like

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,500
analog is code examples and rest when

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,360
doing this we really recognize that they

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,700
come from a certain space and that we're

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,120
gonna use that space to get them started

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,890
off and rest some other great some other

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,210
and entry points interests that have

00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:17,210
helped me that I recommend to other

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:18,590
people are rust by example the second

00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,100
edition of the rust book which we all

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,830
know and love but they they don't have

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:28,010
to be the only point of entry so so here

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:30,170
is my like call to action for all of you

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,750
create your own point of entry into rust

00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,950
think about how you first learn trust

00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,690
think about the way that you would have

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,490
liked to learn dressed and teach people

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,470
that way and you know you might be

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,880
thinking that the way you would teach

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,010
borrows semantics or the way that you

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,660
would teach the difference between sell

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,230
and ref sell would only make sense to

00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,850
you and maybe a few others but what or

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,830
you might think that you know you could

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,870
use like the docs to to learn like what

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,090
when to use sell and when to use ref

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,710
sell but what those other resources and

00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,450
what those Doc's lack is your

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,190
perspective and your background and I

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,380
really want to tell you that that is

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:06,110
like what is going to make your that

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,670
resource so powerful the greater the

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,710
variety we have in the learning

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,330
resources in the rest community the more

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,340
powerful we will be because the more

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,820
people will be able to attract and serve

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,500
cater to and not only will this make it

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,360
easier for people to learn and rest but

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,950
it will also normalize this idea that I

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,930
am really invested in and I think you

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,580
should also be really invested in which

00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,530
is that systems programming is for

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,020
anyone and everyone you don't have to

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:32,510
start off with assembly C C++ and rust

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,440
you can start off with JavaScript rust

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:38,180
Ruby rust pick your favorite language

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,890
and rust and I think that we can we can

00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,880
all agree that that idea needs to be a

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:48,770
bit more pervasive in the tech community

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:51,110
so I love conferences I love them I've

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,910
attended them and I've been really

00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:56,510
really lucky to get to speak at them

00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:58,820
I've and seed them somehow and I've even

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,980
organized them and I think that

00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:04,400
conferences per have such an incredible

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,810
amount of value of you know rust my

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,850
first introduction to rust happened at a

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,040
conference some of the closest people

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:13,040
that I I know in the in the tech space I

00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,170
met at a conference and I also really

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,750
love small conferences small conferences

00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,730
are the best okay these are some of my

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,430
favorite conferences this Bank Bank on

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:24,800
on the on this end which is a small

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:26,420
conference run in New York check them

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,280
out the one at that end is the

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,380
conference that I organized which is in

00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,760
Canada by the way and the one in the

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,480
middle is this conference called rust

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,670
felt rust it runs in Ann Arbor Michigan

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,590
and as someone who attends many

00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,360
conferences and workshops and so on I

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,070
increasingly feel like

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,320
small and localized events have their

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,630
own kind of power right they're less

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,950
intimidating to newcomers they make it

00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,830
easier for people to form connections

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:54,080
and make new friends and to sort of get

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,640
to know each other it also makes for a

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,250
better learning experience if all you're

00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,770
there to do is to learn you know how a

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,570
certain technology works and they're

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,549
also less expensive to organize and

00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,290
since they're less expensive to organize

00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:08,270
that means we can have more of them

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,460
which is great because DAC events can be

00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,650
pretty inaccessible if you don't have

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,179
the ability to take time off from a job

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,250
or if you don't have the money to travel

00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,799
to a whole different city or a whole

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:21,470
other country to attend a conference now

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,200
as rust girls and sighs our events will

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,700
as well it's it's reasonable and maybe

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,620
also a little exciting to think of how

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,780
in a few years rust conferences will be

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,640
you know multi-day will have multiple

00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,470
tracks and that's like like I would love

00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,000
to attend a conference like that but at

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,640
the same time I don't want to lose sight

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,190
of the fact that small events like this

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,640
have an incredible amount of value and I

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,320
will keep it handing small conferences

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,040
and Russ Bridge is a great example of

00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,440
this so most Russ bridges are like under

00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:54,049
25 to 30 people the first rest bridge I

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,390
ran had like five people which was like

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:58,309
actually the best and I really think

00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:00,620
that the power of Russ bridge lies in

00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:03,410
its size we usually end up with a pretty

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:05,120
high student 2 to 8 to TA ratio and so

00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,679
the students end up learning rust but

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,299
they also really end up engaging with

00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:10,100
these people who've been doing rust for

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:12,169
a little bit longer they get to hear

00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,120
from their experiences and they get to

00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:16,190
hear about the rust like ecosystem and

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,990
the rest community as a whole so it's

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,790
like it's not really like rust the

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,500
language they're learning but it's rust

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,620
the community they're joining and I

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,419
think that's so so valuable and so given

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,250
that Russ bridge is so impactful and

00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:30,799
given that the best Rest bridges are

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,710
small the only way to multiply the

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,650
effect of rust bridges is to run your

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:38,750
own brass bridge so here's my second

00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,809
call to action or my third I forget my

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,970
second probably my second is to run a

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:46,280
respite in your own city is you know

00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,830
some basic rust and I'm pretty sure most

00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,169
of you probably do get in touch with a

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,510
community team and ask how you can run a

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:54,830
respiratory will help you with the

00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,779
curriculum you can mod

00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,510
by it if you want we'll help you with

00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:01,250
logistics advertising food whatever you

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:07,190
want we just want people running more

00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:08,960
dressed bridges but why stop there so

00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,789
like I said before think about what you

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,380
know and where you came from and use

00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:15,350
that to organize an event that hasn't

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:17,029
been done before most of the you know

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,830
the technical events that we have around

00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:20,870
rust our meetups workshops at

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,120
conferences and rest bridges but I want

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,799
to go beyond that like what if we had a

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,289
contribution workshop where you had

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,639
first-time contributors to rest come up

00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:30,019
and they were mentored through their

00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:31,700
first contribution to an open source

00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,230
workshop that would be an incredible

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,450
amount of work but I feel like that

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,649
would be so impactful and so useful so I

00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,799
would I would love to see someone

00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:41,240
organized that another idea I had was a

00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:42,740
capture the flag event in which like

00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,820
each challenge is like a rest related

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,250
thing and it doesn't even have to be

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,289
programming related it can be like what

00:24:46,250 --> 00:25:02,990
was the create that it's used for

00:24:48,289 --> 00:25:05,179
command line argument parsing so here's

00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:06,830
my second call to action for you run a

00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:09,049
rust event that hasn't been run before

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,779
think about the kind of event that you

00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,039
would like to see and it takes some work

00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:14,889
it takes some effort it takes some

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,120
initiative to take some some money oh

00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,860
but I would really love to see more of

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,760
this happening and not just like you

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:24,860
know in North America but why stop there

00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,889
does anyone know where I'm going with

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,809
this I hope you don't so it wasn't long

00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:31,669
ago that I was at a conference the same

00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:35,240
conference where I was introduced to

00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:36,320
rust by the keynote that Ashley gave and

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,120
I was like thinking about the program

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,649
and like how I'd improve it and how you

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,960
know I wish that things were done that

00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:43,519
way and not not that way and I just

00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,100
turned to my friends and I was like

00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,980
let's run a conference here and they

00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,889
were like okay and a year later we ran

00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,970
it and it was great and that's us right

00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:54,970
there last year and

00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,980
and we're running it again in 2019 of

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,020
and we'll probably keep running it a few

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,270
more times it's called star con by the

00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,460
way if any of you are interested but my

00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,500
point is I'm not really trying to plug

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,230
stock on here our twitter handle is star

00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:16,700
ki sio n by the way if you want to

00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:18,260
follow us but it wasn't a lot it wasn't

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,820
as much work as I thought it would be it

00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,590
was definitely a lot of hard work it

00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,960
required a lot of outreach a lot of

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,550
initiative but we got it done and we

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,650
were all just undergrads so I'm sure

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:30,850
some of you can get this done too so

00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:35,030
here is my last call to action for you

00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:36,890
run a rust conference some basic things

00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,200
okay before you like shake your head to

00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,300
go like oh my god she is like a lot um

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,390
some basic things you need to run a

00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,010
conference are a name it's easy it

00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,300
doesn't make like more than 15-20

00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:49,700
minutes to come up with a solid name a

00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:53,360
team of really excited organizers who

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:56,000
like you know just as excited just as

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,020
excited as me about conferences a venue

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,850
where do you want to hold your

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,980
conference and a date and then you need

00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,500
like food and money and speakers but

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,240
like that will follow once you have this

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,360
like starter pack but I've given to you

00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,670
now so go off and run your own rest boss

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,830
conferences I'm not saying it's gonna be

00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,780
a cakewalk I'm not saying that it's

00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:16,640
gonna be easy but it is incredibly

00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,440
rewarding as someone who has like run

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,510
her own conference I am telling all of

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,700
you that it is incredibly rewarding to

00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,410
run your own and that's been done before

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,120
and like I said conferences can be

00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:29,600
really inaccessible so the more we have

00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:31,250
the better it is for everyone so I

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,110
really want to wrap up by saying that

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,420
what attracted me to rest was the

00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,340
language like I cannot tell you what I

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,170
what went through my head when I was

00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,720
like a systems programming language with

00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:44,179
like match statements like how even this

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,030
is so amazing but what made me want to

00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:51,320
stay was the community itself and it

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:53,870
requires a lot of non-trivial work to

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,450
evangelize our core values and then to

00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,940
follow up that evangelism with concrete

00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,070
actions but this is the sense of purpose

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,710
that we need to move with if we want

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,150
Russ to be different than all the other

00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,760
systems programming communities that

00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,960
preceded and you can quote me on that

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:22,630
so that's all I have thank you very much

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:22,630
