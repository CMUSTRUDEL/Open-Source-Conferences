Title: Percy: Isomorphic Web Apps with Rust + WebAssembly — Chinedu Francis Nwafili
Publication date: 2018-11-28
Playlist: Rust Belt Rust 2018
Description: 
	Percy is a modular toolkit for building frontend web applications in Rust. It supports serverside rendering out of the box.

In this talk we’ll dive into how Percy works under the hood, starting with a look into its Virtual DOM implementation.

You’ll hopefully walk away with an understanding of the pieces that power Percy - as well as a good sense of how to get started with using Percy to build your own web apps.

When not chasing my unofficial goal of becoming a four star chef - you can find me working on open source modules, tweeting about graphics programming or blogging about building a 3d game in the browser.
