I am personal wiki guy and this is my

00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,619
wiki it weighs 1.6 megabytes

00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,500
users get from management and whatever I

00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:23,439
want for editing it costs me one over

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:28,570
four hundred thousand dollars to host

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:31,150
this wiki for 12 years dumb joke aside

00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,280
really it does cut it is that deer cheap

00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:36,670
it is a wonderful collaboration tool for

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,920
things besides code who knew the next

00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,410
interesting bit is that this is not just

00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,980
this is not all that my wiki is my wiki

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:47,200
is also this so if you want to fork my

00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,780
wiki and use my wiki and make your own

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,060
wiki go right ahead I have no problem

00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,710
with that at all

00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,540
important notes my wiki has a has a

00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,880
readme it tells you what you can do with

00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:02,650
it it also tells you what it's for

00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,930
that's important it also has a license

00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,880
so if anybody else wants to use this

00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,430
they are legally allowed to do it and

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,810
have specific legal guidelines for what

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,869
they are and are not allowed to do with

00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,600
it that's personal wiki's it's really

00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:18,549
easy really wonderful allows you to send

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,729
your collaborative design process into

00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:23,289
the design world into things that do not

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,119
talks very specifically well with

00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:26,289
algorithms

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,200
maybe later they'll talk with algorithms

00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:31,679
but right now not so much

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,679
this is my wiki

00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,549
[Applause]

00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,549
