Title: Lightning Talks: Rustbots - Robots powered by Rust — Rahul Thakoor
Publication date: 2018-11-28
Playlist: Rust Belt Rust 2018
Description: 
	This lightning talk proposes developing a framework similar to Johnny-Five to make using Rust for Robotics and IoT easier. Leveraging the embedded-hal ecosystem, we could develop a framework that can run on microcontrollers like ARM M0 cortex to single board computers like Raspberry Pi, all using embedded-hal compatible platform agnostic drivers.
