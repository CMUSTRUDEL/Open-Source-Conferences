I'm gonna be talking a little bit of

00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:16,550
just going through a actual like family

00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:19,640
tree if we look through what this is if

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,650
we look through actually how yeah I know

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,510
that so this is actually California

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:31,220
that's you know we tested this out just

00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:33,739
frozen okay so since I can't actually

00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,520
show anything and this is fully visual

00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:39,649
this is kind of awkward but I I would be

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,050
showing you diagrams about how Russ

00:00:39,649 --> 00:01:04,550
comes from ski scheme and this is really

00:00:45,050 --> 00:01:08,180
sad so this is why I was like we need

00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:10,100
images I'm like I can't I can't do this

00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,700
much for my brain it's too much

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,230
okay so here's like from this to 2016

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,550
all the way back to wait really long ago

00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:24,550
the 50s

00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:27,260
okay so let's clean this up a little bit

00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,220
yeah so now these are the only ones we

00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:35,600
actually care about

00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:38,480
I spent my lunch break doing this okay

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,100
so we got rest at the bottom in the next

00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,670
red are the ones that it's directly

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:48,800
inheriting from so we got Haskell Erlang

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:53,240
Oh Campbell scheme our five RS c-sharp

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,310
2.0 limbo which I looked up and it is a

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,200
language that came out of Bell Labs I

00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,320
hadn't heard of it before

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,690
C++ and Objective C so now let's look

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,210
back at of course everything traces back

00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:08,090
to Fortran like that's you know it's

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,440
it's clearly at the top but let's look

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,819
at each of these different ones so we

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,840
can learn a little bit about the history

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:16,850
so Erlang goes up to Common Lisp and

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,220
prologue which then of course just goes

00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:23,930
up to Lisp sounds you know make sense

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:31,470
Haskell goes up to gopher and Haskell

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:36,080
which goes up to ml and SML Oh camel

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:39,330
goes up to camel and SML and then ml

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,720
scheme has a bunch of schemes until it

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,610
actually reaches scheme also the naming

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,800
is very strange it's like scheme MIT

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:53,720
scheme 86 and then scheme are three RS

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,740
are for RS or five I don't know weird

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,880
why did they skip to three

00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:06,620
I don't know but and that goes all the

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:11,180
way up to over to L go L got Algol okay

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:16,170
60 so that goes all the way up there and

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:18,720
c-sharp goes clearly up to C C sharp and

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,550
then goes up through Java and into the

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,520
C++ world which will actually talk about

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:33,420
in a second limbo goes to AC and then up

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:36,540
to s or a CSP which then goes up and

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,900
over to all these C's and again back up

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:43,080
to all go and then we got Objective C

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,020
and C++ in the middle here so these go

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,620
up to small talk and all of the small

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:53,280
talks they're up to Simula and again all

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,820
the way up there I'm apparently too

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,820
short for this

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:04,160
oh yeah that would have been a good idea

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,160
this is more entertaining

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,349
okay so the other thing is objective-c

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,239
goes in or ADA comes in here so

00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:16,639
something if they're in green they're

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,739
directly next to one with reds so I

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,169
missed where one of these are oh it's a

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:24,800
objective-c so Objective C comes from

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:27,320
ADA which then goes up to Pascal and up

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:43,940
I can actually also share this image

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:45,229
later okay so oh my god yeah this is

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,630
actually nicer because I had them

00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,060
written down here so I could have

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:52,820
actually just told you what each was

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:57,620
okay so which ones have we not touched

00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:00,560
yet so we were talking a little bit

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:04,310
about c-sharp which goes up and has some

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,060
oak in it and C++ up to Java and 'his

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:13,400
Annett Objective C is just ADA which is

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:14,360
Pascal plus C now I'm just trying to

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,530
figure out where I well if there's

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,780
anything I want to cover on this

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,330
specifically okay so some of the

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,970
interesting things in this to me where

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:27,950
some of the things that we're missing

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:30,140
I wasn't it's so strange to see like

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,570
Python and Ruby and all of those things

00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,490
missing because they have they are

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,620
pretty intertwined with a lot of popular

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,510
languages and rust is nothing like them

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,160
so I should not have been surprised in

00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,990
any way but it just seemed like

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,300
something that they inherit from would

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,700
be used so it's really awesome to see

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,979
how to actually just get to make this

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,210
chart and learn all about it one of the

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:51,380
ones I thought was entertaining is

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,740
there's a programming language called

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,120
hope so

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,240
rust has a little bit of Hope in it you

00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,240
know

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:06,000
no it's an old hope I'd like you see

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,410
like look like look over actually that

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,860
might be the same year around the same

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:14,940
year is a new hope it looks like it's 79

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:21,090
so okay I think that's about it so

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:23,880
questions go ahead I am planning to do a

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,860
longer version of this talk that got

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,470
accepted in January so I've been looking

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,479
up different resources and I took

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,449
someone else's generated thing and then

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,300
went across it but I hand traced all of

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:49,130
them and like that's how I got the

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:49,130
specific rest one I just did not see it

00:06:51,950 --> 00:07:00,360
