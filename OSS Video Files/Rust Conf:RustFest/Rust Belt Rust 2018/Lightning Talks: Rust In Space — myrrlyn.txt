hello everybody what's up I'm Merlin I'm

00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,870
25 years old and I've never given a talk

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,870
before so I have no idea how this is

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,289
I'm Merlin pronounced like the wizard I

00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,680
am officially a satellite software

00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:29,560
engineer I work at a subsidiary of Utah

00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,779
State University and I have used Russ

00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:36,730
since mid-2016 the first draw spell

00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:39,730
trust was my first conference so I build

00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,309
program tests and operate satellites I

00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,199
have nothing to do with Q boss they do a

00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:47,019
cool stuff but I have never used it or

00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:48,399
looked at it I also showed it into do

00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:50,170
two of those things but we're a small

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
company and I was the only person

00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,840
willing to show up at midnight and do

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,910
bad things so there I was so yeah I work

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,250
on you know satellites like this very

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,570
nice piece of iridium there are 77

00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,890
iridium satellites and they're coming

00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,130
out of the sky so if you want to see

00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,660
flares and now is the time just kidding

00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,800
I don't touch those those are expensive

00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,300
and my company is too small

00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,039
I make cube size there in the palm of

00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,899
your hand please don't hold them I

00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:19,409
shouldn't even do that I definitely have

00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:21,189
it's bad so once upon a time I was

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,310
subcontracting for a subcontractor for

00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:25,750
NASA long story but if there's NASA in

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,130
there so you know it's cool and I have

00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,960
some memory testing to do so I thought

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,829
there's a very important tool I have

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,840
available to make sure that the weird

00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:36,130
components down in that box are working

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,149
correctly so I reached from my favorite

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:42,250
language Swift so some of you might be

00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:43,840
thinking Swift that's a really heavy

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,610
language that also runs only on Apple

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,590
devices are you flying an iPhone and yes

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,060
people have literally done that I wish I

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,170
was joking god I wish that was a joke

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,759
they're very powerful computers they're

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,950
armed ships the red heart and you can't

00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,210
fly them I'm kidding of course though

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,390
this is a Ross conference I didn't use

00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:05,829
that Swift I used this one that's also

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,509
not a joke follow me on Twitter so I

00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:09,519
don't write was rust at work I'm very

00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:14,560
sorry to tell you all that I write

00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:19,209
things like C++ Python Ruby and C the

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,100
bad C I wish I didn't but I target a

00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,109
very old version of an operating system

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,470
called vxworks and the compiler we have

00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:29,120
only likes C 89

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,590
I wish this was a flashlight so you can

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,220
see the afore that you should be feeling

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,959
right now we use Ruby and Python for the

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,310
groundwork I'm a very talented and Multi

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,860
faster than individual we don't fly

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:44,750
those they're very slow so I don't write

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:47,180
write rust at work but I want to so rust

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,640
has helped me out in a supporting way

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,470
for a lot of my work so far I've not

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,030
even two years old at this company so

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,190
the fact that I've been on like four

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:59,630
projects is kind of weird but I wrote a

00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:02,540
kernel module in C 89 it was hard it was

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,450
a networking middleware that took

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:09,170
messages from a different computer on

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,310
the same bus held them in the kernel and

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,560
then pretend that there were 16

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,540
different device files and that's more

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,110
or less how everything in /dev works on

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,940
Linux which is to say badly so I rewrote

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:24,049
it in rust at home on my own time and I

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,940
found well I'm bad at writing C which is

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:30,410
a sentence everyone who compiles C

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:33,280
should say so I rewrote it in rust and

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:36,890
then I found all my bugs and then I

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,750
rewrote it in C still 89 because good

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,750
things don't happen to me and this time

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,910
it worked very well I also wrote and

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,760
network multiplex are in rust so this

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:49,190
was a thing that handled all the data

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,980
coming down from our satellites looked

00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,480
for a very specific type of packet

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,840
filtered that specific packet out

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,250
rebuilt the messages from it it took

00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,630
about a day it was very fast because I

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,660
didn't have to do all the weird things

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:05,989
like finding a needle in a haystack of a

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:09,290
binary stream or whatever else I use

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,670
because I just search at i/o for binary

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,530
search I think I don't know the

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,609
criterion but I found a thing I put it

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,290
in it worked great

00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,810
this was C I'd have had a bad time we're

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:21,620
implementing it myself so that was a

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,930
success and then this happened so this

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,630
number means a lot to people in my field

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,970
and probably nothing to you guys this is

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,940
how many cube SATs we launched from the

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,310
planet that never talked for one reason

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,140
or another the rocket kills them they

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,300
don't launch they don't turn on once

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,580
they launched we don't know they never

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,879
talked to us we don't know why they died

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,509
but my mission which I can't tell you

00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:49,580
what it was called or for whom it was

00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:54,289
was one of those 22% so for the next

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,389
about six to ten months there is a piece

00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:58,340
of aluminum about the size of a loaf of

00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,539
bread whizzing around the earth slowly

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,240
falling at the atmosphere and then one

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,979
day it will die

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,189
so my network multiplexer never got off

00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:09,379
the shelf so that's what I've done so

00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:12,259
far at work rust has helped both of

00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,460
those in the auxiliary manner and it's

00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,870
time to collapse on the hurry up a

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,000
cosmonaut is a cool project that I've

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,270
been working on this is all in present

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,319
tense

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,969
that's all a lie it does this and this

00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,150
and those don't exist yet I'm still

00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:28,190
working on them it barely exists it's a

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,629
learning project rust has a lot of

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,550
resources that have been really really

00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,620
cool for me to learn how to program and

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,060
domains that I didn't know before didn't

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,710
happen school is required to be

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,000
open-source but because I worked for the

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,949
military-industrial complex it is

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,990
probably read only because ITAR exists

00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,939
and I don't like it so in conclusion I

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,259
haven't flown rust sorry it's usually

00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:47,719
empowered to see that I have delivered

00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:49,190
and that it found all the bugs that I

00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:51,379
didn't it made me a better programmer

00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:53,180
and most importantly space loves love's

00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,069
love's safety we take that very

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,129
seriously and everything we do software

00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:00,199
hardware process all of it so my

00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:02,029
company's very psyched about where rust

00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,310
is going in the future we want to start

00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:06,740
using it it's just we have weird targets

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,780
and not even our LLVM hits them so we're

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:16,410
kind of stuck thank you

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:16,410
