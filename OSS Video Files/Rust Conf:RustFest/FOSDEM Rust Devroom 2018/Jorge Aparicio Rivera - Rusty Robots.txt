Title: Jorge Aparicio Rivera - Rusty Robots
Publication date: 2018-02-06
Playlist: FOSDEM Rust Devroom 2018
Description: 
	Programming a self-balancing robot in Rust

Are we embedded yet? I'd say yes! In this talk I'll show you how I programmed a self-balancing robot from scratch. I'll cover IO abstractions, motion sensors, motor drivers, filters, control stuff, bare metal multitasking, logging, etc. And I'll explain how some of Rust features made development easier and made the program more correct.

Jorge (@japaric) has been part of the Rust community for over three years. Over that time he has contributed to the Rust compiler, standard library and other official Rust projects like Cargo. With his background in mechatronics engineering and the help of the vibrant embedded Rust sub-community he's working towards making Rust a great language and ecosystem for embedded development.
