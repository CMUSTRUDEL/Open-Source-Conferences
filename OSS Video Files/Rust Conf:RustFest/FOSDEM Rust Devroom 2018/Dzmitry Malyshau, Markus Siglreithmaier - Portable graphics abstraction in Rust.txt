Title: Dzmitry Malyshau, Markus Siglreithmaier - Portable graphics abstraction in Rust
Publication date: 2018-02-06
Playlist: FOSDEM Rust Devroom 2018
Description: 
	Bringing Vulkan everywhere with gfx-rs

Graphics abstraction is an important part of maturing Rust ecosystem. gfx-rs has been the basis of many graphics applications since 2013, but as of this year it undergoes a total rewrite with the new vision, set of goals, and talented contributors. In this talk, I want to explain what this means to existing users, Mozilla, and the world.

Intended audience: people interested in Rust ecosystem foundational libraries, graphics and game development, Vulkan.

Dzmitry Malyshau
Lots of computing and gaming in childhood. Graduated with math and computer science in Belarus, then migrated to Canada to work in game development. Now working with Rust on graphics at Mozilla.

Markus Siglreithmaier
I'm a Computer Science student focusing on Computer Graphics (including Real-time rendering and physically-based animations). I'm mainly working on gfx-rs and associated projects in my spare time at the moment among other smaller Rust projects.
