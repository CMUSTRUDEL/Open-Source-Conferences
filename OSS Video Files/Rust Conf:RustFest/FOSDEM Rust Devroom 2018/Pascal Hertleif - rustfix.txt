Description: 
	â€¦and the journey to getting better code automatically

Rust programmers often seem happy to get compiler errors. Understandably so, the compiler is known to not just catch what would in other languages become a run time bug, but also to be quite helpful. On top of that, the clippy project adds more than 200 additional lints, to catch even more errors, but also help guide users towards writing more idiomatic code. This talk is about the dream of automatically fixing many of these errors (based on compiler-provided suggestions) with rustfix.

Pascal Hertleif has been writing code professionally for the last seven years and is active in the Rust community since 2014. He is the author of multiple open source libraries and co-organizer of Rust Cologne. Currently, he is studying computer science at the university of Bonn, Germany, as well as working as freelance software developer.
