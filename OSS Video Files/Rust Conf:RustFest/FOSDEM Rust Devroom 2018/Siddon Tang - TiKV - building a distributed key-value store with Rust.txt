Title: Siddon Tang - TiKV - building a distributed key-value store with Rust
Publication date: 2018-02-06
Playlist: FOSDEM Rust Devroom 2018
Description: 
	A transactional key-value store powered by Raft

Itâ€™s not an easy thing to build a modern Key-Value database which supports the distributed transaction, horizontal scalability, etc. But this is exactly what we are doing and we have built such a database from scratch using Rust. The database is named TiKV. In this talk, I will share how we use Rust to build the storage, to support replication across geographically distributed data networks, to implement an RPC framework, to inject failure for tests, and to monitor the key metrics of the whole cluster.

To build a distributed Key-Value store from scratch, we need to consider many things. In this talk, I will share with you the following experiences when we build TiKV.

Siddon Tang is the Chief Engineer of PingCAP. He has been working on TiDB, the next generation HTAP database, and TiKV, a distributed key-value store. He is an open source lover and has developed quite a few Rust libraries like rust-prometheus, rust-grpc, rust-rocksdb, etc.
