Title: Oliver Schneider - Reaching const evaluation singularity
Publication date: 2018-02-06
Playlist: FOSDEM Rust Devroom 2018
Description: 
	An introduction into miri and Rust's const evaluation

The Rust interpreter miri has been merged into rustc to be its new const evaluator. This merge not only fixed various bugs in the old const evaluator, it opened up the avenue for many new features. Ever wanted to do a for loop in a constant? Want to parse a toml file into a static Config struct and report parsing errors as compile-time errors? Well, now you can do all that (pending RFCs for the details). In this talk I will present miri's design, its usage in the compile-time evaluator as well as future features that are enabled by it

PhD Student in Software Engineering for Safety and Security Critical Software at the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology since 2014. Rust tools peer (clippy, miri) since 2017. Likes books, embedded development, programming languages and dogs.
