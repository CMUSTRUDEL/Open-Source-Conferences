Title: Nikita Baksalyar - Demystifying Rust Parsing
Publication date: 2018-02-06
Playlist: FOSDEM Rust Devroom 2018
Description: 
	Language parsing and automatic binding generation



Usually, the topic of parsing the Rust source code is associated with the Rust compiler itself, which for many is an uncharted territory. However, parsing by itself can (and should) be used out of the context of the Rust compiler: given the wealth of information that we can extract out of the code, we can do a lot of thing with it.

In this talk, we'll discuss several interesting applications for the Rust parser and the abstract syntax trees it produces, with practical examples of Mozilla bindgen (automatic generation of Rust library bindings based on C source code) and a Java binding generator written by the author for a large-scale open source library.

Some prior basic knowledge of compilers and parsing is expected.

The intended audience is Rust developers who want to learn more about the internal implementation of the Rust compiler and to practically apply this knowledge in their projects.

Nikita is a Mozilla Tech Speaker and a Rust engineer at MaidSafe, developing an open source peer-to-peer network technology and contributing to other open-source projects, including the Rust compiler. He's enthusiastic about the Rust programming language, also interested in low-level development, P2P networks, and alternative operating systems (like e.g. BSD/Illumos).
