Title: RustFest Rome 2018 -  Neal Walfield: Sequoia: A New OpenPGP Implementation in Rust
Publication date: 2018-11-24
Playlist: RustFest Rome 2018
Description: 
	OpenPGP is best known for its use in email encryption. But, OpenPGP is, perhaps more importantly, used to secure software updates, sign commits, and protect backups.
Historically, OpenPGP has been hard for both end-users and developers to use--we know, we actually worked on GnuPG! In Sequoia, we are trying to change that. Sequoia is a new OpenPGP implementation that places as much emphasis on usability as on security.
Sequoia is also written in Rust. This talk will focus on the challenges that we've faced using Rust--infinite types, streaming iterators, designing a clean API--and our solutions.
