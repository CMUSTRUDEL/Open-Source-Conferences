Title: RustFest Rome 2018 -  Tshepang Lekhonkhobe: Behind The Scenes Of Producing An Executable
Publication date: 2018-11-24
Playlist: RustFest Rome 2018
Description: 
	If it's a mystery what actually goes on when you do a 'cargo run', then this talk is for you. It explores the sequence of steps taken to get to a working executable, from high-level code, to machine code, and what happens in-between. We'll do a simple example and see what each representation looks like, while touching on the steps in-between. In the end, we'll look at the generated RISC-V assembly.
