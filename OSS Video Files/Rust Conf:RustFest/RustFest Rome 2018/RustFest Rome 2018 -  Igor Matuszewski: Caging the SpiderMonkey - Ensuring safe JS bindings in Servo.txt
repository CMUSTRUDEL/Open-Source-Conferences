Title: RustFest Rome 2018 -  Igor Matuszewski: Caging the SpiderMonkey - Ensuring safe JS bindings in Servo
Publication date: 2018-11-24
Playlist: RustFest Rome 2018
Description: 
	This talk will focus on some of the challenges encountered while working on integrating SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine with the Servo web browser engine (written in C++ and Rust, respectively). We will explore how Rust's rich type system made it possible to enforce many Servoâ€“SpiderMonkey interface rules and safety considerations at compile time and how a custom compiler plugin was developed to verify against project-specific errors at a language level.
