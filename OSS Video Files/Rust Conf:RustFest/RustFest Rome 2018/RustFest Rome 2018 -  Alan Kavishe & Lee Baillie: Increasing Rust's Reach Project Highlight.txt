hi there how's it going we are here to

00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:16,110
tell you about the increasing rusts

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,270
reach program i'm lee Bailey I used

00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,880
they/them pronouns and I'm currently a

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,100
web developer at Tilda in Portland

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,230
Oregon in the United States I've

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,810
attended almost every rest fest except

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,510
for the first one I spoke at roast fest

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,699
Kiev and I attended the Paris Zurich and

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,210
now Rome so it's really awesome to be

00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,940
here again

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,090
I was a rust reach participant in the

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,950
first iteration in 2017 and in 2018 I

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:47,250
returned as a partner Allen hello

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,350
everyone my name is Allen I participated

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,570
in Russ tweets 2018 that was this year

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,539
for those of you who don't remember and

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,149
I'm currently a full-stack developer in

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,420
South Africa doing front-end and

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,280
back-end even though I live in Namibia

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,229
and this is my first West fest my first

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,630
trust conference my first software

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,500
conference ever but it will not be my

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:14,909
last back to Lee and she first talked to

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,159
you right yeah a lot of firsts so what

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,090
is the increasing Russ reach program or

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,350
rust reach which we call it for short

00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,390
increasing rusts reach is one of several

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,580
programs run by the Russ programming

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,970
language team to grow rusts community of

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,950
project collaborators and leaders the

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,390
program matches Russ team members from

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,150
all parts of the project with

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,680
individuals who are underrepresented in

00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:40,049
rusts community and the tech industry at

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,110
large for partnership of three months

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,240
from mid-may to mid

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,180
agrees to a commitment of three to five

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,450
hours about every week working on a Russ

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,700
project so unlike a traditional mentor

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,259
mentee relationship we refer to the

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,689
groups of people in the program as

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,850
partners and participants which

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,649
reinforces the fact that we believe the

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,229
project has an equal amount to learn

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,680
from participants as they have to learn

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,390
from partners so a typical week will

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,390
include a one-hour meeting with your

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,920
Russ partner a one hour weekly sharing

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,650
meeting with a larger group of pro

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,600
program participants and a few hours of

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,510
pairing or in two

00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,770
work on your specific project so since

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,890
partners and participants are

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,940
distributed all over the world a lot of

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,680
the time these weekly meetings will

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:33,290
happen two times to account for all the

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,030
different time zones Ashley was the one

00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,070
who ran their weekly meeting most of the

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,600
time and she often arranged for guests

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,430
to come and speak to all the

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,810
participants participants about their

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,050
role in the RUS community which was

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,000
really awesome

00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:49,850
best of all by way of thanks for

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,280
participating in the program they offer

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,710
a fully paid conference to get travel

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,930
and accommodations to every participant

00:02:54,710 --> 00:03:00,140
to a one Russ conference of their choice

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:03,140
so I'm just curious does anybody here

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:07,400
from Russ reach or anybody come here on

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,860
Russ reach ticket at all nobody that's

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:15,590
sad the other night they're not using

00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:18,670
their tickets anyway so some rest reach

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:22,430
projects this year included wasum diesel

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:27,020
co i rustling org internationalization

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:29,210
and design and clap RS some stats about

00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,400
the rest reach 2018 program are that our

00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:35,450
partners and participants spanned nine

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,460
time zones eleven countries 64% speaking

00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:41,210
English as a second language and have

00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,890
fluency in more than 14 languages there

00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,930
were a lot of changes from the first to

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,790
second year of rust reach since it was

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,270
kind of a big experiment the first year

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,190
was a lot more freeform our partners and

00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,870
participants largely would choose how

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,000
they wanted to approach the project and

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,280
they organized they organized it however

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,870
they wanted the only real initial

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,670
requirement was you have to do like

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,140
three to five hours of work on your

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,090
project every week and you have to check

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,690
in with your partner at like whatever

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,720
intervals you design on so some of the

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,120
big changes in 2018 was that actually

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,930
took over the bulk of organizing I think

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,180
the original organizer was Carol she

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,930
added weekly group meetings with the -

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,100
time zone options with guest speakers

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,320
everyone checked in with her every week

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,520
she made sure everything was running

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,810
smoothly every time they were hiccups

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,479
you would like work to smooth them over

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,930
so basically you know the biggest

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:44,409
difference between 2017 and 2018 was

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:45,629
Ashley she was great so however I say

00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,860
that based on my personal experience

00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:50,949
since she was the one I interacted with

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,419
the most so I would like to just give a

00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:54,099
little round of applause for the whole

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,100
organizing team for the intern

00:04:54,099 --> 00:05:00,049
restoration program

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,049
[Applause]

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,080
they all worked really hard and they

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,420
made it awesome for everyone so I'm

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,050
gonna hand it over to Alan to talk about

00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:13,750
his experience

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:16,900
hello again back to our musical

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,730
microphones this is Mira's reached

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,120
experience it started with the

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:25,360
application to Russ tree so I don't use

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,500
rust at work I ran across it a couple of

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,180
years back and I thought it looked

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,590
pretty cool at least I look better than

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:35,050
C++ at the time we didn't have a use

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,120
case for it so the best I could do was

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,210
follow a couple of people on Twitter and

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,210
star a couple of github repos and thanks

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:45,400
to that I came across an invitation for

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,280
applications to rust reach on my Twitter

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,780
I thought what is this thing I looked it

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,080
up and it seemed like the type of

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,330
project that really does help a language

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,130
that's somewhat in its infancy because

00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,590
what you want more than anything else is

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:03,520
to not have a language that is designed

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,500
by one homogeneous group of people the

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,750
more voices the more eyes you have

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,700
looking at your language design process

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,040
the better the language comes out so I

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,810
thought hey maybe I'll try apply and see

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,680
what happens

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:19,330
I applied immediately the application

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,120
itself is quite nice the questions

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,700
generally just try to figure out are you

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,390
using rust would you like to use rust

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,550
where you come from what can you bring

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,910
to the table as a participant in this

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,880
project and do you have the time to do

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:40,960
three to five hours a week I did have a

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,790
time so then I was one of the few lucky

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,380
ones that got in I did not expect that

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:49,150
happen but it happened so then after

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,570
that actually reached out to us via

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,790
email and got everything started so at

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,530
the beginning we still had to figure out

00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,630
how we're going to communicate I didn't

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,820
know anything about the 2017 or us to

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:04,270
reach project so for me the whole

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:07,540
concept of a conference being conference

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:11,200
type project being run from America

00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,390
while I'm South Africa and participants

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,900
are from Japan and Australia and

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,910
whatever

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,979
it seemed really like a logistical

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,500
nightmare but I actually sorted that out

00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,750
in one email and everything worked

00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,039
perfectly after that so the first thing

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,660
they did was give us our project

00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,910
assignment so part of the application

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,490
was a list of projects that we will be

00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:33,610
doing this year a trust reach and the

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,009
list included I think Lee already

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,620
mentioned a couple claps Eli was an and

00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:41,440
so on so you had to choose a couple that

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,940
you were interested in and once you got

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,520
into the project they assigned you to

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:48,310
one of these groups and I got assigned

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:55,030
to the Clapp group working with Kevin

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:57,940
Knapp who's one of the few exceptional

00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:01,000
programmers I've met and it's been lots

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:03,130
of fun working with him so once I got

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,010
into my project the next meeting was to

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,650
meet up with Kevin so myself Kevin and

00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,889
other participants in our group met up

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,660
with him and we just sort of had a first

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,419
meeting to get to know each other who's

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,780
Kevin who's Alan who's this what have

00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:22,210
you been doing with rust and if nothing

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,240
what do you want to do with rust so it

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,669
was a very casual welcoming environment

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,949
right from the start which i think is

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:32,080
great because there was no restriction

00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:34,539
on who can join the program you didn't

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,110
have to be you know ten years of rust

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,450
usage you know anyone could join so we

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,700
started with that and Kevin's idea to

00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,779
get us going was to simply write the

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,640
little Linux utility UNIX utility

00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,709
interests not all of it just as far as

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,200
we could go and he would take a look at

00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:55,959
our code see what we're doing and maybe

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,850
just contribute a bit to how we write

00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:59,740
and at the same time we would get to get

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,750
some experience from him see how he

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,670
usually codes and whatnot and this

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,020
allowed him to establish a baseline for

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,260
both myself and the other participant

00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,360
after that we get straight into the work

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,310
for the project so the first month of

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,529
the project was mostly us just getting

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,990
our feet wet rust and the rest of the

00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,330
project was the actual work for us

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,329
treats that we needed to do and for

00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,880
myself Kevin decided that we are gonna

00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:26,650
try and get clap to Version three and he

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,930
had two major things you want to deal

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,270
with one was

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,160
yeah Mille parser so for those of you

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,570
have used clap you know that one way of

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,360
entering your arguments is via a llamo

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,160
file and we wanted to move that to start

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,770
using sterday yeah Moe rather than

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,530
Yammer rust that was our initial plan

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:47,620
and we got to a point where we had to

00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:49,450
stop because one of the ways that surly

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,520
reads the m-files wasn't really

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,320
compatible with what Kevin wanted to

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,690
happen when it comes to crap reading the

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,460
file and since we couldn't fix it on our

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,580
side was sort of an issue in the

00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,540
dependency so in amo we decided to let

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,730
it rest for now

00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,830
so I don't think it's been changed yet

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,930
so if any of you is expecting that we're

00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,540
using survey ml in version 3 we probably

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,610
aren't for the second attempt we decided

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,410
to jump into the other thing that Lori

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,500
was talking about today and that is

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,810
struct opt so they have been for a long

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,390
time clap and struct opt as the two

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,430
libraries for augment parsing

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,830
reinstructive just builds on top of crap

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:30,250
and adds prop macro to do all the work

00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,690
for you and Kevin spoke with the person

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,870
who wrote struct up and they decided it

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,270
would make sense to merge the proc macro

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:41,230
into crap if possible so that was our

00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:43,870
second task and I never used the prop

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,670
macro at all I've never seen the code

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,060
for a block map read obviously never

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:51,280
debugged a prop maker either so this was

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,370
a hugely new experience for me but

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:57,100
thankfully I had wanted two hours every

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,230
week sitting with Kevin on video chat

00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,480
with code open and he would walk through

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,610
the code I would actually drive and he

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,230
would say okay jump to this file and in

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,180
this file is this going on and this is

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,800
what happens when this changes and so on

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,680
and so forth so it's a huge learning

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,110
experience for me and it also gets Kevin

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,520
himself to think about his code as he

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,250
writes it so a lot of we had quite a bit

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,260
of refactoring happening just because

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:23,890
Kevin couldn't easily explain what was

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,690
going on here or there and so together

00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,870
we got through quite a bit of the code

00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,370
up until one point where while we were

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,160
missing a comma which happens all the

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,920
time and finding a comma in a macro is a

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,860
problem we use a lot of cargo expand

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,860
that didn't really help it's a great

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,170
tool though

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:47,209
fantastic tool but in our case it didn't

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:49,040
help a little after a bit of checking

00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:51,860
out github code and water we found the

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,250
comma we deleted it and yeah everything

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:58,040
tests past goals achieved and yeah so I

00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:01,820
think we have a working derive for clap

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:04,760
now which might be in version 3 so you

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:09,320
might not have to use drop table maybe I

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,430
don't know after that we had we kept

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,660
having these meetings that actually

00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,140
every week and at the end of everything

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,680
was mostly just a winding down so for me

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:21,560
what was rust fest increasing rust

00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,480
reached 2018 sorry it's a fantastic way

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,709
to build this community there's a lot of

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,630
people who would never have got an

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,339
interest that were there and I know

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,110
quite a few people that I've spoken to

00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:31,910
about this and they're really excited

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,829
about rust even though they are never

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,899
used it before so that I think is a

00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:37,820
great thing about increasing rust reach

00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,560
it was extremely well organized and

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,779
handled right from the very first

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,790
application all the way up until the

00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:46,130
very last meeting it was fantastic for

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:49,880
me at least and I think it was so for

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:52,040
all the other people who were involved I

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,829
would like it to be a bit more public

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,990
during the project there's not a lot of

00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:59,540
people outside of the project that could

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,130
follow along with what we were doing and

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,550
I think that would be better just for

00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,980
the communities as a whole and again

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,540
because I liked it so much I want more

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,600
people to experience it I want more

00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,640
partners to have a chance to mentor I

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,529
want bigger groups for the partners a

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,240
longer time period for us the whole

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:19,760
thing a whole bunch of things I want but

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,459
it's just more of increasing rust weeds

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,920
and that pretty much was my experience

00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:31,600
in rust return 18 thank you very much

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:33,950
[Applause]

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,020
so I also want to talk a little bit

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:37,670
about my personal experience with Russ

00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,560
reach since I got to experience both

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:43,070
sides as a participant the first year

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,420
and a partner at the second year so as I

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,600
mentioned I was a participant the first

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,180
round in 2017 and I was chosen to work

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,760
on redesigning rustling org with another

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:56,330
participant overall I had a positive

00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,529
experience but if I'm being honest since

00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,990
it was the first iteration of the

00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,060
program it was a little bit rocky it

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,459
seems like your experience really

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,980
depended on who your partner was and how

00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:08,300
much structure they put on it and in my

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,970
case there just wasn't really that much

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,120
structure beyond like oh we want a new

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:19,160
design but I don't really know that much

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,810
about website design so yeah since I'm a

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,180
web developer I'm not really designer it

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,160
proved to be pretty difficult I did the

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,140
best I could but I didn't really get

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,310
that much feedback on my work I wasn't

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,190
really sure what I was supposed to do a

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:33,320
lot of the time I learned a lot because

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,089
in spite of my background I actually had

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,440
never built a website from scratch from

00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:39,500
the ground up so that was kind of cool

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,760
to experience even though the none of

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,320
the work that I did during that time

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,790
ended up getting used for anything I was

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,430
still really useful because I learned a

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,990
huge amount of stuff however the

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,149
experience that really stood out for me

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,950
during that first iteration of rest

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,250
reach well after the program was over

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,500
was when I attended Russ Fez Zurich I

00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,050
was really anxious about attending that

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,270
conference because at that time I had

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,459
come out as trans a few months before

00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,950
and I had changed my name and I look

00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,079
different but like not that different

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,149
so I already been involved in the rest

00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:13,250
community before I was in Russ reach I

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:14,690
had spoken at Rose fest Kiev so like

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,810
some people knew me but it wasn't really

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,550
that short like it was it was very

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,700
nerve-wracking showing up to that Rose

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,800
fest so I knew the community you know

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,660
wasn't that diverse in spite of all you

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,550
know our best efforts so I really wasn't

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,980
sure how it was gonna go or how I if I'd

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,360
feel comfortable but I ended up meeting

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,820
a bunch of other people who were also

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,399
participants who turned out to be other

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,690
members of underrepresented groups and

00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,699
it was one of the best parts of the

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,140
conference for me I immediately had a

00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:44,000
group of people who I felt really

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,480
comfortable with and we end up just

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,879
spending the

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,129
in Zurich together and it was amazing I

00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,199
can't possibly overstate how much of a

00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:52,970
difference it made for me to have those

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,839
people who are also in the program to

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:59,359
hang out with when I was there in Zurich

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:02,029
so as I mentioned in 2018 the rest reach

00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:03,350
program made some big changes some of

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,639
the organizers switched hands and the

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,129
program became a lot more structured

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,709
this time around I also made the switch

00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:13,129
from being participant to partner and I

00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:15,049
had two really talented designer slash

00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:17,629
developers working with me to implement

00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:20,449
a new design for the rest Lang worksite

00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:21,379
which is obviously not like out there

00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:23,389
yet

00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:26,179
but I can't speak for the participants

00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:27,889
obviously but for me I tried really hard

00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:31,160
to ensure they had a positive experience

00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:34,879
and I used my time as a participant in

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,559
2017 as a model for what not to do which

00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,970
is like still worthwhile so I thought

00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,019
about all the things I wished I had and

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,779
I just tried to make those things a

00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,249
reality for them so some things that

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,169
were important to me were to set out

00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:47,720
achievable goals make sure I was

00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:50,059
extremely communicative make sure to

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,529
give feedback often so everybody always

00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:53,749
knew what they should be doing and what

00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:54,619
they were doing next it didn't always go

00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:56,629
as I planned

00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:59,720
but I do think their experience was a

00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:02,359
big improvement on mine my biggest

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,389
advice from my experience as a partner

00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:07,010
to other people who maybe are working

00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:09,350
with people who are underrepresented or

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,360
just like really shy or maybe not very

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,339
confident which is the experience I had

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,049
with my participants is that you cannot

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:19,459
be too nice you cannot be too friendly

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:23,179
anytime you feel inclined to reach out

00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:24,649
you should reach out you should check in

00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:27,589
on people and see how they're doing and

00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:29,480
just be proactive about offering to help

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,070
or to pair if they don't feel if you

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,740
seem like they're not making a lot of

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,870
progress don't expect that just because

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,690
they're quiet that they're fine you know

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,340
a lot of the time people get blocked by

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,960
things that are more psychological than

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,389
skills-based at least in my experience

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,830
with my participants they were really

00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:47,000
talented they were capable people but

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,260
they would just psych themselves out of

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,230
things because they just didn't have a

00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,669
lot of confidence so I found a large

00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,080
part of my job as a partner was actually

00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:56,720
just like making sure that they are

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,950
heard like listening to them being their

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,360
cheerleader

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,929
getting them out of their own ways like

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,880
probably the biggest thing and by the

00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,440
end of our three months together I was

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,760
able to guide both of my participants

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,740
through the process of making their

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,960
first pull request and therefore the

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,630
first commit on the repo which was a

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,630
super exciting super big joy for me to

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,460
experience this probably for most people

00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,429
has probably been a long time since you

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,899
submitted your first pull request ever

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:25,399
and like sitting there waiting for it to

00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:27,710
go green and clicking the merge button

00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:29,990
like I don't really remember mine but it

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:34,519
was it was just really like magical to

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:35,960
watch them experience that so anyway if

00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,850
