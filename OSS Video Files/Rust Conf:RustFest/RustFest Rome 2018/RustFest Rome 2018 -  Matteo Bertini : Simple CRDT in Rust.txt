Title: RustFest Rome 2018 -  Matteo Bertini : Simple CRDT in Rust
Publication date: 2018-11-24
Playlist: RustFest Rome 2018
Description: 
	A conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) is a data structure that can be replicated, each replica can be updated independently and it is always mathematically possible to merge the replicas back without conflicts. The simplest CRDT is an _append only_ Set, where the _merge_ is the Set union, building upon this idea we can compose more complex data types. In this talk we will explore how to implement a `cli` for a CRDT shopping list, see how Traits are emerging during the code evolution, use cargo to include some useful crates with no pain, and document the code with runnable examples.
