Title: RustFest Rome 2018 -  Ryan Levick: Oh Boy! Creating a Game Boy Emulator in Rust
Publication date: 2018-11-24
Playlist: RustFest Rome 2018
Description: 
	The magical thing about Rust is its ability to remove the fear of learning new things. My journey with Rust has led me to the world of hardware emulators - specifically old gaming machines from the 80s and 90s. Join me as we explore what it takes to implement a fully working Game Boy emulator. We'll take a look at the ins and outs of this 30 year old gaming wonder, learning a lot along the way about how computers and Rust work! By the end we'll have our emulator running in a web browser, a window on our Desktop and even a mobile phone!
