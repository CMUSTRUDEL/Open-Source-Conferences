Title: RustFest Paris 2018 -  Scalable Networking with Rust by Tigran Bayburtsyan

Description: 
	Tigran Bayburtsyan knows how to scale
a network service without fail
using #rustlang, MIO,
and a threadpool to go
so fast all competitors pale

Real-time networking applications becoming more popular, but building backend systems is challenging in terms of memory and cpu efficiency. This is a story about how at TreeScale (github.com/treescale) we got 10X+ memory and cpu efficiency using Rust MIO as a main network TCP/UNIX handling system with thread pools.
