Title: RustFest Paris 2018 -  Yew a Rust+WebAssembly framework for client-side web apps by Denis Kolodin
Publication date: 2018-05-26
Playlist: RustFest Paris 2018
Description: 
	Here is Denis Kolodin for you Talk
about his framework called 'yew'
His daily work fits
to a fury of bits
and a Rust blockchain speed-trading crew

This is a talk about the architecture of yew â€” a Rust framework for frontend development, inspired by Elm and ReactJS and designed for creating single-page webapps with Rust. You will get to know how it was created: wasm compilation issues, JSX-like templates created with a pure Rust macro, how lifetime rules helps to avoid copying of the model, and how to create a framework without a garbage collector to compete in the JavaScript world.
