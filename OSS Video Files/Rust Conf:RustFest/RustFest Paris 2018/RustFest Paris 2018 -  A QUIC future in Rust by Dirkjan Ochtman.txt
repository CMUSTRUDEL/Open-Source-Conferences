Title: RustFest Paris 2018 -  A QUIC future in Rust by Dirkjan Ochtman
Publication date: 2018-05-26
Playlist: RustFest Paris 2018
Description: 
	Dirkjan Ochtmann takes us on a ride
to the future of Rust serverside
to learn what async fate we will have to await
Meanwhile let us Rust far and wide! 

Once HTTP/2 was standardized in 2015, the IETF started work on an even faster iteration of HTTP, based on QUIC: the Quick UDP Internet Connections protocol. The QUIC community is getting ever closer to standardizing it. While we have great HTTP and HTTP/2 implementations in Rust already, this talk discusses an effort to implement QUIC in pure Rust, based on the futures ecosystem.
