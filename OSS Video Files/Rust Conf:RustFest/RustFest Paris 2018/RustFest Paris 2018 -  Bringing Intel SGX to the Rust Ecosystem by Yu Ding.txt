Title: RustFest Paris 2018 -  Bringing Intel SGX to the Rust Ecosystem by Yu Ding
Publication date: 2018-05-26
Playlist: RustFest Paris 2018
Description: 
	Yu Ding from Baidu X Labs today
is securely joining the fray
to rust'ly enclave
your bits to behave
that's a big deal for securitay 

In this talk, we introduce Rust SGX SDK (future code name MesaLock SGX), which can protect secrets from most attacks by combining the power of Intel SGX and Rust. Intel SGX is the next generation trusted computing technique supported in almost all recent Intel CPUs. It provides strong security guarantees and uses a completely different os/threading model, but lacks memory safety guarantees. We show how we ported Rust std and a series of fundamental and popular Rust crates into the Rust-SGX world. Whatâ€™s more, we support Xargo by providing a new target platform as x86_64-unknown-linux-sgx.
