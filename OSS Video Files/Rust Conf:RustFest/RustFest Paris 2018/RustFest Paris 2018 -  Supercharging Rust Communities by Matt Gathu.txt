Matt kethu talks about success our

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:15,199
community can have with less abrasion

00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,730
and grief what a welcome relief so

00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,730
that's something really should stress

00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:25,239
[Applause]

00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:56,899
I'm super excited to be here so yeah how

00:00:39,019 --> 00:01:02,049
much all the way from okay so yeah so a

00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:04,580
little bit about me so my talk is about

00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:09,049
rush community supercharging rush

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:15,170
community and my story of how I got into

00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:18,079
rust was that in 2017 I got lucky to be

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:22,039
accepted in the fast rush Russ rich

00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:24,770
program and I spent three months working

00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:29,060
with really nice mentors I believe one

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:32,450
of the mentors is here and also working

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,030
with another colleague and we were

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,109
basically in different places we had

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:40,130
different interests different

00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:42,920
nationalities and I got a really good

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,590
experience from from those three months

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,960
and the fact that the Russian community

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:53,240
was welcoming and good to me felt it

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,960
became it I felt challenged and as I

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,999
decided that I will start a meetup

00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,420
locally so and here we are that's why I

00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:05,990
started the res Nairobi meetup group

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:09,560
we've been there since November actually

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:13,340
October of last year and it's been great

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,230
so far and so I was thinking when I got

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,850
the invitation to come speak

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,069
I thought it to be great to talk about

00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,650
community since it's how I got into rust

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:31,140
and it's something I really care about

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:35,730
so this is a map of countries around the

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:38,190
globe where there is a sort of wrath

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,770
interest so there are actually

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,760
recitations in these countries and this

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:47,580
is based on the Twitter followers of the

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:54,420
official rust account and I want to show

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:59,030
you another map so this is another map

00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:02,519
and it shows countries where we have

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:05,670
rough meetup groups or the days like a

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:11,519
rust user group and this is based on off

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:14,340
from meetup calm and if you can

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,600
adjust compare the two maps you can see

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,820
that there were way more countries where

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,970
there's actually interesting rust and

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,690
there are rust developers but there are

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:32,720
no like communities on there not visible

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:36,810
and my talk is designed around that how

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,060
do we scale communities of to be

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,140
worldwide you know scale it beyond what

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:47,660
we currently have and personally from

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,790
experience when I started rust Nairobi

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:54,269
it's not easy and even I've been having

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,950
a few conversations with people who are

00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,489
involved in running which are meetup

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,760
groups and communities and they say it's

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:06,209
not easy and I personally felt

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,040
challenged or I felt almost like I need

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:13,019
to build this thing and I'm alone I

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:15,060
don't know how to start but having had

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:21,510
the experience from the rust which

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:24,840
program I knew that rust itself as a

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:28,530
project it's a really it's a success

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,510
it's a triumph and in this can actually

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:34,280
be shown

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:38,450
data that actually shows how rust as a

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:42,350
project is successful so and just to

00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:45,550
highlight this so there was the I

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:51,070
believe in the 2018 stock overflow

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:54,770
develop a survey and this away we had a

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:57,620
28% Oded of the developer saying that

00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,200
they love Ruston's actually voted the

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,770
most loved language and it's not only

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:07,010
this year it's been for the last three

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:14,000
years which is amazing to see how much

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:17,420
people love rust there is then they it's

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,180
also a popular project on github and

00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,270
just looking at the number of people who

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,060
have actually done contributions to the

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,890
compiler and that a this number will

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,280
have changed because they are always

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:36,350
more contributors to the project and

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:38,330
also looking at the number of tools that

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,550
people have built with the language

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,910
based on the number of crates that are

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,820
at the uncrated oh and the interesting

00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,070
thing is that this the number of crates

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:54,530
have been growing exponentially over

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:56,600
time so I started to ask myself that

00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,990
since rust as a project is really

00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:05,270
successful what what makes it so

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:08,120
successful what are the ideas that the

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:11,450
rass project has what is this thing that

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,760
is being done so consistently that over

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:18,220
the years has been successful with

00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:24,070
success stories and how can we learn

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,070
from this to build our local communities

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:35,100
so I have several ideas that personally

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:37,930
I think are very important in the

00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,110
Rast project and that we can learn from

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:44,220
and I'll talk about flood governance

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:49,320
will explain that I'll also talk about

00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:54,630
diversity and inclusivity also about

00:06:49,320 --> 00:07:00,250
having a roadmap having a vision also

00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:06,250
decision making and lastly about having

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:09,730
a code of conduct and and the idea here

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:13,090
is that since these ideas are sort of

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,950
the spirit of the Russ project then as

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,470
Russ communities and we when you're

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:21,160
building local communities we should

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:24,670
also try and emulate these ideas or at

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:31,240
least they can be a guiding light to

00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:33,850
local communities so on flood governance

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,850
so it's it's very interesting and it's

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:41,350
something I have noted that in rust

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:44,740
there is no hierarchy in how the project

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,140
is done they are actually sub teams that

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:52,080
are divided and there are more or less

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:56,380
independent of each other and very

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,430
autonomous and the interesting thing

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:02,200
about that is that things get to move

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:06,040
really fast because we don't have that

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,920
bureaucracy of someone or the head of

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,650
something else to approve anything and

00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:15,250
also there is trust between each of the

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:17,020
team because you believe that the other

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,020
team knows what the what they are doing

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,640
and you trust in them and I think this

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,950
is very important even in our

00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,790
communities so like when I was touching

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:30,520
our roster Nairobi I tried to as quickly

00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,050
as possible get other organizers

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,570
involved I didn't want to be the only

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:39,850
person heading the Meetup

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:41,650
so at the moment we we have four people

00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:45,310
in the organizing team and the idea is

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:48,040
that for way to like a half a meter for

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,500
haba talk or do something atyminius

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,630
creative like getting even as simple as

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,660
getting someone into our slack

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,579
organization or our what's up group

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,889
doesn't need for like one person to do

00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:02,079
that if you're part of the organization

00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:04,569
too much means you should be able to do

00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:08,740
that and I think this model of

00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:20,069
governance where there is no one head of

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:23,440
that is really great so going back to my

00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:25,889
story about how I joined the res

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,110
community so diversity inclusivity is

00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:33,850
more or less that caused the wrath which

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:39,480
program is designed to get rust into two

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:42,370
underrepresented groups and I felt that

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,889
having a goal such a goal was really

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:48,880
great cause a the community gets are

00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:51,180
diversified and I think also if we are

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,000
doing local communities we should also

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:59,380
be conscious about and be very

00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,230
deliberate in making diversity a thing

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:08,769
and I know diversity and from experience

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:12,370
is is not easy so I have this picture

00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:17,079
this picture was from the first workshop

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,699
we did was in apron and and I'm sure

00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:20,860
most of you are thinking it's a weird

00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:23,829
picture they are and I'm talking about

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:27,160
diversity because if you look at it

00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:33,519
there is no lady on in the fiftieth yeah

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:35,769
and and I realized that it's it's it's

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,329
hard but I think we have to be

00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:40,060
deliberate conscious and it's something

00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:44,579
that me and my organizers are constantly

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:47,829
thinking of how do we make it easier for

00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:51,759
more people you know avoid genders of

00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:54,220
all technical skills to come in join our

00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,069
groups so this this particular one here

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,930
we were the majority of people who

00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:01,170
attended were college students and we

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,700
had targeted that we

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,200
knew there were people who are

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,180
professional developers who are doing

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,060
Russ in a ruby but we also knew that

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,130
these are a community of students who

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,829
are not even aware of the language so

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:17,190
also thinking of how you can reach out

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:24,149
to people and basically improve

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:30,930
diversity and inclusivity then on the

00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:35,220
roadmap so so alia on this year there

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:38,190
was the the call for blog post this was

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,100
before the Russ to in teaching roadmap

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,370
so the roadmap is was mostly influenced

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,130
by the survey that was done in 2017 and

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,480
also the call for blog post which was

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:52,199
people talking about what they would

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,660
want to see in rusty Xia and based of

00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,730
that we have the the road map where and

00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:01,470
now we have you know working groups

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:05,430
coming out of that and the fact that you

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:10,140
have sort of a plan for what you're

00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:12,600
doing you're not like for us it's not

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,060
like we we do a meet-up every month we

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,310
kept asking ourselves what do you want

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,149
to see in our community in a ruby

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:24,480
where do we want it to go and early on

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:27,420
this year we said we have a goal that in

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,120
2018 we'd like to do a rough day event

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,820
so before the year ends and how do we

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,190
get there so we said we will have

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,440
meetups and we will also do workshops we

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:41,160
will also try to do outreach go to

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:45,660
schools speak to student and all that

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:48,959
being geared to they actually went at

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,880
the end of the year and this was by and

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,740
large heavily influenced with how

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,769
actually the Russ project is run because

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,350
also the project has a vision and a road

00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:00,810
map that we use as a guiding light to

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,959
doing that and the good thing about

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:05,569
having a road map is that when you

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:09,630
accomplish one thing completion tasks

00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:13,110
it's a time for you to

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:16,800
celebrate cuz you've met a milestone in

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:19,470
your journey also it shows that the

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,230
community has a shared vision when you

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,790
have new members they they feel

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,699
connected and we know that these a

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:29,639
journey and there's a story to this

00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:32,279
community so I also think that this is a

00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:48,870
very good thing to have when you're

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:51,569
starting a local rest community then so

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:57,440
that this thing called the RFC process

00:13:51,569 --> 00:14:01,440
which is basically how features and

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,110
changes to the last the rough language

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,630
are made where someone suggests a

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:11,250
feature you have people deliberate about

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:13,319
it discuss and then decide whether we

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:19,560
are accepting it or rejecting it and why

00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:22,470
and this process is also very open so

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,839
you could go on github and see all the

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:29,040
RFC's that have been done you could go

00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:33,589
to the users forums and see the

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,540
discussions what what that were had and

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:38,850
the fact that this process is open and

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,709
that the decision that is made for

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,490
example when you decide to accept or

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:46,800
reject an RFC it is not made behind

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,220
closed doors not made by one person it

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,730
is made by the community through active

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,250
discussion and deliberation I think it's

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,160
something really cool about Russ and I

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:02,310
like it cause I can always go and see

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:06,120
why stuff was done and why things are

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,310
the way they are and I also think this

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,980
is important in our communities most of

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,899
you are doing something that is

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,880
important to everyone you should not

00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,819
make that decision yourself we should

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,449
try and seek feedback and this can be

00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:23,179
through having town halls

00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:26,359
or actually sending a simple feedback

00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:31,759
form to your members and then using that

00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:33,439
to guide your decision when you when

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:41,410
you're deciding or bring an important

00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:49,429
decision then on the code of conduct so

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:56,329
I really like this quote it's by by

00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:59,499
grade on so I think that one of and this

00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:05,019
I feel like some time is underrated

00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:08,449
why the rush community is very welcoming

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:12,169
it's a very safe community and there's a

00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:15,439
lot of respect for you as an individual

00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:17,839
and I think it's because even early on

00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:22,100
when the community was coming up there

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,410
was a very big conscious effort to make

00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,779
sure that the community to be safe that

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,970
it would be open and welcoming and I've

00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:33,259
seen I remember reading a discussion

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,939
online where someone asked why the Ross

00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:38,720
code of conduct is a little weird to

00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:41,720
them and this code is pulled from their

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,759
greater needs explaining that he wanted

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,239
are the rest community to work to be a

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,069
home because developers would go to

00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:53,179
other forums other communities and it

00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:55,699
was a bit toxic to them and I think we

00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:58,609
should also spread this message for our

00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:01,639
local communities that we are very

00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:05,449
conscious of people who join us we are

00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:08,870
open and welcoming and we also care

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:18,620
about your safety and also show our show

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:21,620
respect and lastly I think that we

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:26,679
should also take time to reflect and

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:31,220
think about what we do as a community

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:32,900
and the reason for this is that it

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:38,330
allows you to

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:41,170
to take a moment and breathe and also

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:46,640
look at you know what is working right

00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:50,600
what is going wrong where where can we

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,850
improve you know and and even also

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:57,230
getting a feedback from from the

00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:59,390
community and it allows you to HR it

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:03,620
faster so for example when we did our

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:05,900
first workshop we you know we chopped to

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,420
the participants and ask them what what

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,670
did you like about the workshop what

00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:14,740
didn't you like what do you think should

00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:18,710
be improved and that sort of

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,750
introspection and reflection really goes

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,360
a long way since when we are planning

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:27,020
our next workshop we are able to improve

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:34,400
on things that we didn't do quite well

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:41,030
and also keep up the good stuff yeah and

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:43,670
I think community is way more than you

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,920
just being part of a group I think it

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:49,970
matters what you do because what you do

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:53,600
is what makes that belonging important

00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:55,790
to you it's not just a matter of saying

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,210
you in the group but even the people you

00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:01,700
interact with and what you work on is

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:06,520
also the importance and making that

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:11,270
environment is really great and lastly I

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:14,600
would like to leave you with a quote not

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:17,900
to don't ask what the community can do

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:21,770
for you but instead ask what you can do

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:36,869
for the community thank you

00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:36,869
[Applause]

00:19:55,629 --> 00:20:03,279
we do have a lot of time so we can take

00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,279
questions are there questions

00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:21,799
there's a question if you had one advice

00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:24,739
to give to someone who wants to open a

00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:28,129
say meetup in a in an area where there

00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:34,210
is no roster for anything else what

00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:38,960
would that advice be it will be to

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:43,249
people to be persistent don't give up so

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:49,340
I remember the first two meetups that we

00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:52,099
had for us Nairobi so you know in my

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:54,649
mind I knew that this is the first rust

00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:56,570
meetup in a row bid is going to be a lot

00:20:54,649 --> 00:21:01,669
of people will show up and we had like a

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:04,609
budget for like 20 30 people and then I

00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:08,539
think only four or five people should

00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:10,190
and I remember there was at the end of

00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:12,289
the meetup with so much food and juice

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,840
left so we're actually telling people

00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:16,399
can you carry in this home because we

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,409
bought all this stuff but nobody showed

00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:23,419
up and it happened for like the first

00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:28,359
two meetups and then later on we got the

00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:28,359
numbers so I think being persistent is

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:42,259
do we have more questions I think thank

00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:45,470
you so much for for the wonderful talk I

00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:48,979
wanted to know what your tips would be

00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:53,299
to keep a meet-up interesting enough for

00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:55,970
more experienced users and but still

00:21:53,299 --> 00:22:00,849
accessible enough for someone who's

00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,849
coming for the first time yeah

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,679
that's a very good question because it's

00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:09,530
something that we are actually

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,600
struggling with and what we thought was

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:15,260
because we knew that we couldn't always

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,260
be doing like beginner talks right but

00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:21,470
we thought how do we sort of cater for

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,970
the two groups of people who are new to

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,870
right and you're people who are already

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,470
used to it

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:30,559
so one idea we thought of is we would do

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:37,159
our shops and this workshops are meant

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:39,950
for beginner people essentially roping

00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,929
rope rope they met them in and then

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:47,059
during our normal meetups those are a

00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:51,620
bit more sort of not beginner talks so

00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:53,690
that we can also get off for the the

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,870
guys were already attending our meetups

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,880
and even because I mentioned we we plan

00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,330
to have an event at the end of the year

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,780
that was Amedeo once we do this workshop

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:09,880
then we will have more in depth workshop

00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:09,880
Catering now for like intermediates

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:27,350
hello I'm from Madagascar and the reason

00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:30,470
why we couldn't make a meet-up at one

00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:33,890
time the discussion came up was because

00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:37,070
most people were not comfortable or

00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:40,250
didn't know how to start contributing

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:43,370
and they were looking for somewhere to

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:46,909
learn how do you even start make a

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:49,159
contribution to to code and and things

00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:52,250
like that I was wondering if you in

00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:55,450
Kenya you you found something to

00:23:52,250 --> 00:24:03,710
palliate that kind of fear I guess of

00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:08,620
exposing yourself in public so what

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:11,529
we've sort of done is again we looked at

00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,889
companies that were tech companies

00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:19,039
active in Nairobi and one of the

00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:20,990
projects we did was get our library was

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,470
there was it was written in Python for

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:28,460
an F an API wrapper and rewrite it in

00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:30,649
rust and since since the majority of the

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,590
check is actually familiar with that API

00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:36,049
since the company's of a very popular

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:38,659
there then it is very easy to rope them

00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:40,850
in cause it to develop that somewhat

00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:46,840
have done the same thing in a different

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:49,789
language also I try to go and speak to

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,320
communities like no trust communities

00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:53,929
have spoken to the Python community at

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,269
home telling them about trust and what

00:24:53,929 --> 00:25:00,289
it is about and trying to get them

00:24:56,269 --> 00:25:03,889
involved too so also think even getting

00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:13,360
sourcing existing tech communities and

00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:13,360
be good any more questions

00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:29,350
hello I'd like to to add another remark

00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:34,120
regarding the introspection point you

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:36,610
made I think it's it's more general than

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,390
the community the history of the

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,960
community

00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:42,039
it's the Azzurri of the computer science

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,140
in general I think

00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:50,650
and because the RUS community learns a

00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:53,350
lot from what other language have done

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:57,700
in the past and one what mistakes they

00:25:53,350 --> 00:26:08,100
are done and I think that it's it's the

00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:12,490
great force of the rust community yeah I

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:15,669
think because I kept asking myself I

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:17,200
don't have to sort of figure out how to

00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:18,549
build a great community called the Arats

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,830
project is really good and the rest

00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:23,590
community is really good so what can I

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:26,049
learn from that and yeah I agree the

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:32,049
fact that rust has learned from other

00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:33,830
community - okay thank you

00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:44,369

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:44,369
