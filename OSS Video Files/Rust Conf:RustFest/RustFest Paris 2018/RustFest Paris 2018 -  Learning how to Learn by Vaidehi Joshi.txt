Description: 
	Vaidehi Joshi – at last! 
She explains in her basecs podcast 
The science behind
what computers mind
so let all of us here have a blast!

A good education can take many different shapes, sizes, forms. Oftentimes, the most profound educations don’t even happen in a classroom. And yet, they all seem to have one thing in common: they teach you how to learn. Being able to learn new things is an empowering skills, especially for those of us working in the ever-changing, fast-paced tech industry. But how can we teach ourselves this skill? Together, we’ll explore one of the world’s most well-known and deeply-loved techniques, which we can use to learn many new things, tech-related and not!

why dahi Joshi at last she explains in

00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:18,250
her basics podcast the science behind

00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,350
the computers mind so let's all of us

00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:27,559
have a blast

00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:27,559
[Applause]

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,510
good morning Russ fest alright okay um I

00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,460
know I'm the first one this morning

00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,370
maybe you haven't had your coffee it's

00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,090
still early but I'm gonna need a little

00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:51,010
bit more energy for my sake but also for

00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,600
yours the stock will just be so much

00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:56,980
better if there's more energy in the

00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:03,040
room so good morning Russ fest so much

00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:04,750
better hello my name is Vita hee

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,009
thank you so much for that introduction

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,390
by the way that is the first time

00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,010
anybody has turned my name into a

00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,320
limerick I didn't think it could be done

00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,030
so that's very exciting you've stepped

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,920
the bar very high now I might have to

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:19,570
just start requesting all my

00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,049
introductions have limericks in them so

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,330
I am super excited to be here this is my

00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:27,700
very first rest fest it's my second time

00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,909
in Paris I still don't really know very

00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,850
much French aside from like Hassan and

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:38,890
fromage I hope I'm saying all these

00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:41,110
words right I'm sorry if I'm not I am an

00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:46,030
engineer that works at a company called

00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:48,369
tilde based in Portland Oregon and I

00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,890
work on a product called skylight which

00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:53,920
is your favorite rails profiler so if

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,869
you work in rails by any chance yeah

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,010
cool I wasn't sure about this audience

00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:00,280
but that's great

00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,799
you should check us out fun fact

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,159
tilde was actually one of the first

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,729
companies and early adopters to use rust

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:13,180
in production and we use rust in our

00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,270
skylight agent and we loved it so highly

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,160
recommend but

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,850
probably this audience is already on

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,470
board or so but when I'm not working on

00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:26,240
skylight I spend a lot of my free time

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:30,620
doing something else I really really

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:34,040
love learning new things and last year I

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,990
decided to kind of take this hobby that

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,970
I have of learning new things to a whole

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,400
new level and I decided to learn

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,320
something completely new I decided to

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,500
learn the fundamentals of computer

00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,650
science and this was a particularly

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,250
scary task for me because I don't have a

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:54,740
CS degree nor do I know very many things

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,840
about computer science concepts my

00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,620
background is actually in literature and

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,530
education so it was scary because I

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,400
didn't know where to begin but I started

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,000
this project called

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,360
ACS and it was a weekly blog series with

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,520
a pretty simple goal my goal was that I

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,750
was going to learn one computer science

00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:21,740
topic and write a blog post about it

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:25,430
every single week for a whole year which

00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,680
that's like 52 blog posts times like who

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,750
knows how many hours so that's some

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,190
complicated math that I haven't done so

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:36,080
feel free to do it good luck and I

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:39,890
actually did end up accomplishing this

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,570
goal I spent a whole year basically

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,240
teaching myself computer science

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:47,360
fundamentals and kind of creating a

00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:51,530
computer science curricula for myself

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,850
and yes to answer your question that all

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,110
of you I'm sure are thinking it was a

00:03:52,850 --> 00:04:03,380
very very long year and to tell you the

00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:05,540
truth sometimes learning CS as someone

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,990
without a CS background was really

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:12,020
really fun sometimes it felt super

00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:15,200
empowering because I was finally

00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,660
liberated as I finally understood all of

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,760
these terms and concepts that people

00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,850
would use in conversation and that I

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,979
didn't understand and it was really

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,810
amazing to finally have that lightbulb

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:30,800
moment moment when that concept clicked

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,930
especially when it was a concept that I

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:38,060
had been super intimidated by like

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:39,950
linkless or graph theory but the other

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,550
side of the story one that I'm not

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:46,640
always super keen on sharing but I will

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,669
share with all of you today is that a

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:53,810
lot of the time learning was really

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:55,190
really hard and I didn't talk about it a

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,100
lot during the course of that year

00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:01,750
because I didn't want other people to

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:06,169
feel disheartened in their own learning

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:09,440
but it was it was this omnipresent

00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:11,210
feeling of being intimidated and just

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,100
feeling very daunted by all these things

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:17,750
that I wanted to learn but didn't really

00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:20,330
know how honestly the harder the topics

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:22,490
got the harder it was to find

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,430
approachable resources that I could

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:29,720
really make sense of so this is a tweet

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,490
from one afternoon about a year ago when

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,150
I was feeling really really helpless I

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:38,630
was trying to learn about a topic called

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:41,720
radix trees if you've ever tried to

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,220
learn them if you google it it might be

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,650
a little scary because you find a lot of

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,390
papers that use calculus which I don't

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,450
know why everybody has to explain it

00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,729
like that but needless to say it was

00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,160
very very hard to learn this concept for

00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,740
me and this was like over a year of

00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:02,960
learning CS that I you know hit this

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:04,789
wall again and again and again and the

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,010
meme that I'm actually referring to in

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:12,110
this tweet is the owl meme which if

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,700
you're not familiar with is this and I

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,560
actually think as I've been talking to a

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,050
lot of engineers I don't even think it's

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,620
just CS that kind of feels like this I

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,340
think it's just learning any new concept

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,729
especially when you have very little

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,520
context for it can feel like this so I

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:30,200
wasn't really alone in that but I think

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,150
the most frustrating part of the whole

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,280
process was

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:40,370
finding resources like CS papers or

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,170
curricula from MIT or lecture videos but

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,850
not really being able to make sense of

00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,760
what these resources were trying to

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,350
communicate to me a lot of the times I

00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,530
would read these papers or watch the

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,690
lecture videos one two or three times

00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:59,720
and still not really feel like I

00:06:53,690 --> 00:07:03,310
understood what the concept was and to

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:06,920
be honest it was super disheartening and

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:09,470
it took a lot of mental and emotional

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:14,210
energy to get through the process of

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:16,460
learning this huge amalgamation of

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:20,270
concept that I never thought I'd be able

00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:23,690
to learn and a lot of the time I felt

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,700
very helpless but a lot of the time

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,850
that's exactly what motivated me to keep

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,980
going I thought if I'm feeling helpless

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,320
learning this I've got to stick it out

00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,420
and I got to have some grit and try to

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,720
distill this information so that someone

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,900
else out there doesn't have to cry while

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,150
trying to learn about radix trees and

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,820
yes I definitely cried while I was

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:50,090
trying to learn about radix trees and

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:54,190
then I made my own meme about it I don't

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:57,500
know if it works but it's honest I guess

00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:00,470
but eventually I did get through every

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,270
single topic that I learned and I did

00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,640
write a blog post about every single

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:09,370
topic and I got through the whole year

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:12,710
and I was very exhausted by the end and

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:16,460
that written series ended up taking on a

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:18,710
whole new life the written based project

00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,370
eventually turned into a podcast which I

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:24,170
now host with my for my friend Sauron

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,370
she's really fantastic she also runs the

00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,860
code newbies podcast you should

00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,040
definitely check it out and a shameless

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,720
plug I have BCS podcast stickers so if

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,340
any of you would like one please come

00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,260
find me after this but it wasn't just a

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,290
written series and a podcast I also

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,979
turned VCS into a video series with the

00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,720
help of the

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,980
content team at the practical developer

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,740
and they work on a website called dev to

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:56,029
so through various iterations of my own

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:58,220
learning and through turning my learning

00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:01,130
from a written series into a podcast

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,019
into a video series I started to see

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:06,680
that there was so much interest and

00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:09,500
demand in approachable computer science

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,019
resources and the fact that there was

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,089
such a high interest in this made me

00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:17,480
realize that this wasn't just a problem

00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:19,910
for me there were lots of other people

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,910
who wanted to learn the CS fundamentals

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:25,100
but couldn't really find resources that

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:30,050
explained these ideas to them in a

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,850
simple way and that year last year when

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:36,260
I tried to learn computer science on my

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:40,160
own and tried to teach myself all these

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:43,160
things by myself it was one of the most

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,870
exhausting years of my career but I also

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,699
learned one of the most important

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:53,139
lessons along the way learning new

00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:57,410
things regardless of what they are is

00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:59,810
very very hard it's honestly extremely

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,670
hard and if you've ever had to teach

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,339
yourself something as I imagine every

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:07,760
single person in this room has then you

00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:09,470
know this back to be true while I was

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,260
creating the content for base yes I

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:16,100
started wondering how do other people

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:19,250
teach themselves new things I wanted to

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,959
understand how people learn and part of

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,670
the reason was that for this was because

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,339
I wanted to understand how to make the

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:30,069
best resources for the most people I

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:34,610
ended up reading a lot of papers on

00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:37,040
psychology and the science and the

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,790
history behind learning and education

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:45,250
and along the way I stumbled upon the

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,250
work of this guy

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:57,520
so you might have heard of him as you

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,370
can see he's got quite a personality his

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,339
name is richard fineman richard fineman

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:06,240
was an american theoretical physicist

00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:09,010
and he created the field of quantum

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,220
electrodynamics he also helped develop

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,820
the atomic bomb and he won a nobel prize

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,410
for his work in physics

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,410
he's also the person who was responsible

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:23,529
for figuring out what exactly went wrong

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:28,180
during nasa's space shuttle Challenger

00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:31,440
disaster but aside from all of these

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,870
things he was also an author a

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,020
philosopher an amateur artist a lock

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,540
picker and of course a bongo player

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:43,810
because aren't all quantum physicists

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:46,960
bongo players but if you spend a lot of

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,850
time reading about his life then you

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,190
start to realize that he did all of

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:55,870
these extraordinary things in the 70

00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:58,839
years that he spent on earth but the

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,550
thread that runs through all of his

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:06,100
achievements whether they are academic

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:10,150
or personal ones it's not physics it's

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:13,240
not science it's not even math it's

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:16,600
actually really this desire to learn and

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,959
understand things new things that he was

00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,370
unfamiliar and uncomfortable with

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,860
Richard Fineman was often called the

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,400
great explainer by a lot of his fellow

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,650
colleagues and his students and he

00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,220
garnered this nickname because he had a

00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:36,940
truly unique way of teaching ideas and

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:40,390
communicating concepts sure he made a

00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,130
lasting impact in his field and in his

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,040
industry and yes he did win a Nobel

00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:47,680
Prize but I like to think that it was

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,090
his work as a teacher that left a far

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,480
greater impact on his field and on the

00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:56,610
in general finally Fineman was actually

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,790
such a good teacher that he kind of had

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,220
a reputation that preceded him when he

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,200
was giving his first talk as a graduate

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,530
student at Princeton Albert Einstein

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,970
actually attended his first lecture in

00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,880
many years later

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,700
Bill Gates would watch videos of his

00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,750
lectures and he actually called Fineman

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:21,600
the best teacher that I never had

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:23,700
in fact Gates was so inspired by

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,890
fineman's work and his lectures on

00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,410
physics that he ended up open sourcing

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,840
them and today all of us can watch them

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:36,810
for free online wherever we are in the

00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:38,880
world but how did Fineman actually get

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:43,350
to the point of becoming a great

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:46,980
explainer how did he himself learn new

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,660
things well I think in order to answer

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,150
that question we have to go back in time

00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,960
a little bit to find mends time as a

00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:58,920
graduate student at Princeton so during

00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,080
his second year at Princeton all of his

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,930
all the students in his program had to

00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,100
prepare for oral exams and Fineman did

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,910
something a little different than the

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,830
rest of his colleagues he didn't open a

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:15,420
textbook and start memorizing formulas

00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:17,490
or try to cram information no he did

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,720
something different he went and bought a

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:24,590
blank fresh empty notebook and then on

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,480
the top of the notebook he wrote this

00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:31,620
notebook of things I don't know about

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,360
and then he set to work filling this

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,980
notebook

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,990
he wrote down all the things that he

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,700
didn't understand things that he

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,260
understood partly things that he wanted

00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,570
to learn more about and then he

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,840
proceeded to unpack and deconstruct

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,340
entire branches of topics that he wanted

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,020
to learn more about or that he needed to

00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,590
learn more about James Gleick is a

00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,960
biographer and he wrote a great

00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:57,870
biography on Fineman called genius and

00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,150
in it he describes this process that

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,310
fine

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:03,070
had for his notebook technique pretty

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:05,500
well he says that in his notebook of

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:10,260
things to learn Fineman tried to find

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:13,870
the essential kernels of each subject

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,060
ironically however this notebook

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,670
technique did not guarantee that he

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,400
passed his oral exams with flying colors

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,200
he actually got one question wrong so

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,480
that just goes to show you even Nobel

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,720
prize-winning theoretical physicists can

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,140
be wrong and make mistakes but at the

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,520
end of these intense learning sessions

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,140
Fineman always ended up with this

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,530
notebook of things that he was really

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:41,020
proud of so okay you might be thinking

00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:45,730
to yourself that's all fine we're not

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:48,250
all theoretical physicists we might all

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,340
not all end up writing these notebooks

00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:56,770
and changing the world and you'd be

00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:58,500
right but I do think that all of us have

00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:01,000
things that we want to learn more about

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,860
and things that we'd like to get better

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,790
at and we all learn in different ways

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,040
and even if we don't end up playing the

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,900
bongos or learning how to pick locks in

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,300
our free time like Richard Feynman there

00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,100
is one thing from his technique and from

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,390
his life that we can pick up and learn

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:23,700
from we can learn how to learn and how

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,810
to learn better so these days

00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,540
psychologists and educators and

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:32,830
scientists refer to this mental model of

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:36,070
learning as the Fineman technique the

00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:38,980
technique itself is actually really easy

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:41,440
it's just four steps and it's derived

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:44,020
from that year at Princeton when Fineman

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:48,040
started teaching himself entire branches

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:50,410
of physics which eventually led to many

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,420
many lectures that he shared with

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:57,070
students around the world

00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,990
so the Fineman technique can be summed

00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,640
up in just four steps so let's walk

00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,930
through them together first and foremost

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,060
this might seem obvious but it's pretty

00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,850
important we have to identify the

00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,009
subject the thing that

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:14,009
we're trying to learn we have to

00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:16,350
understand what the exact topic is that

00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:17,880
we're trying to learn more about before

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:20,490
we can go about steadying it even

00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,730
further and the best way to do this is

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,909
to write down everything we know which

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,230
is basically what Hyneman himself did to

00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:30,120
we should write down everything that we

00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,380
know about a topic and as we learn more

00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,899
things about it

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,980
add to that repository of knowledge next

00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:41,460
once we've written down everything that

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:44,070
we already know about something we have

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,320
to take all of our knowledge about it

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,669
and try to explain it to someone who's

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,870
unfamiliar with the topic so

00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:54,000
psychologists and educators alike say

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,759
that for best results you should try to

00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,090
explain or teach the topic as if you

00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,500
were teaching it to a child and the

00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,279
reasons for this are actually pretty

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,679
interesting so this is beneficial first

00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:11,460
because it forces us to speak in plain

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,830
and simple terms this might make sense

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,909
because children are probably not likely

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:21,210
to understand complicated terminology or

00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:23,460
fancy jargon Fineman actually once said

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,649
that when we speak without jargon it

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:29,730
frees us from hiding behind knowledge

00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:31,889
that we don't actually have in his own

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,590
learnings he realized that by forcing

00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:37,289
himself to explain things without

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:40,230
relying on jargon or terminology as a

00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:42,710
crutch he started to realize when he

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,659
actually understood how something worked

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:48,929
versus when he understood what something

00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:53,840
was called and those two ideas are very

00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:56,159
very different a lot of the times

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,230
Fineman noticed and educators have

00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,269
noticed this as well we think that we

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,299
understand something what we really

00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:05,460
understand is the word or the term to

00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:10,049
describe it not really the underlying

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:12,809
ideas that fuel a concept by forcing

00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:16,169
ourselves to explain something simply we

00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:19,860
are pushed to get to the heart of what

00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:21,880
is going on within a concept another

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,500
benefit to explaining things as if

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:28,060
were explaining them to a child is that

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,830
it forces us to also be brief brevity if

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,060
you've ever hung out with children or

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,950
those of you who have children in the

00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,690
audience you'll know it's pretty

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,250
important when you're talking to a child

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:40,930
because they don't have the attention

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:42,850
span for long winding wordy sentences so

00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,550
this kind of explanation forces us to be

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:49,060
creative it forces us to be concise but

00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:50,950
also understandable and this is actually

00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,890
where we have a few tools at our

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,110
disposal so drawings can actually be

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,410
pretty helpful here and find men knew

00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,900
this too one of the most famous drawings

00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:04,480
that he created and one of the most

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,420
important tools and his tool belt was

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,320
diagrams and this is actually a great

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,570
example of that

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,460
it might look funny to you at first but

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,800
this is actually the Fineman diagram

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,410
which he used to describe the

00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,710
interaction between electrons as well as

00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:23,280
particle movements and Fineman diagrams

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,990
are now some of the most well known

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,260
explanations for particle physics but at

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,880
the time when he created this it was

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,370
pretty strange because most people

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,520
hadn't used squiggle Alliance to explain

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:40,780
the relationships between particles but

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,120
it worked pretty effectively a small

00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,990
aside in my research of Richard Feinman

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,030
I learned that he actually had Fineman

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,650
diagrams drawn on his van and he would

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,440
like drive around Caltech with these

00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,480
Fineman driver and bands and just in

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,590
case you couldn't recognize which car

00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,780
was his he also had a license plate that

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:05,750
was memorable quantum

00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,790
cuz uh he had a great sense of humor and

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,810
he was a huge nerd and I guess what else

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:13,190
do you expect from a quantum physicist

00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,320
but anyways I digress back to the

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,200
Fineman technique

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,600
so once we've used simple terms to

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,220
explain our concept it's likely that

00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,610
we'll notice that there are actually

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,800
gaps in our knowledge because as we go

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,810
to explain something simply if we don't

00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,390
really understand it we're not gonna be

00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:36,020
able to communicate it and teach it in

00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:37,430
simple terms and this is where step

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,820
three comes in and it's arguably the

00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:44,390
most important we have to identify gaps

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:47,120
in our knowledge this is where we

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,580
realize the things we do or don't know

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,470
and this is the time when we go back to

00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,590
the books to the resources to the blog

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:59,840
posts and truly it's where the actual

00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:01,400
learning happens if we don't really

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,230
understand how to explain something

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,460
simply then we won't get very far

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,210
because we don't really know the key

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:14,080
points of a concept

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:16,970
finally when we've cycled through

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,370
resources and we've honed in on our

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,990
knowledge of a concept or a topic in the

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,870
process of trying to teach it to others

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:27,680
well we're finally ready for the last

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:30,410
step which is step four where we have to

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,420
organize and simplify all of our

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:36,410
knowledge into a narrative in order to

00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,660
explain it to other people and in

00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:40,670
fineman's case he would use all of his

00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:44,210
knowledge and kind of construct a story

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:47,870
and then explain a concept using a story

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:51,350
in order to really communicate the ideas

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:54,560
of how something worked so when he used

00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,750
this technique when he was teaching or

00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,960
giving lectures he would use simple

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:02,780
sentences for storytelling and this was

00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,090
pretty effective and a great example of

00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:08,240
this is how he described how atoms

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:10,640
worked in a single sentence so see if

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,429
you can try to find the simple sentences

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,860
and the concrete ideas that he's

00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:19,050
explaining without using jargon

00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:22,170
Fineman said all things are made from

00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:25,350
atoms little particles that move around

00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:27,000
in perpetual motion attracting each

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,840
other when they are a little distance

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,420
apart but repelling upon being squeezed

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:39,540
into one another and Fineman also used

00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:42,900
analogies in order to make storytelling

00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:47,250
more impactful he used analogies to take

00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:50,070
concrete ideas and communicate them to

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,530
other people my favorite example of this

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,140
is a lecture that he gave in the early

00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,690
80s if you google it's the computer

00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,350
heuristics lecture and you can watch it

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:04,110
online and he's basically describing

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:08,880
what a computer is and he describes it

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:12,480
as a glorified high class very fast but

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,450
very stupid filing system which like

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,980
even today many many years later this

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:22,500
analogy still holds true and it's a very

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,780
very simple analogy and he tells it in

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,450
you know this inherited arc of how a

00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:30,810
computer works in the context of the

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:33,540
smiling system but it's actually very

00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:35,340
simple he's using simple terms to

00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:39,030
communicate and otherwise really

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,650
complicated concept and I think the

00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,350
Fineman technique is powerful for very

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,060
many reasons but the reason I wanted to

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,780
share it with all of you today is that

00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:52,710
it's particularly important I think for

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:55,500
programmers and the reason for this is

00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:59,210
that it tests it forces us to test our

00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,830
own understanding and it simultaneously

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:05,760
challenges whatever assumptions we think

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:07,500
we might have and as many of you in this

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,570
room might know we tend to make a lot of

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,720
assumptions and then it's good when you

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,640
know things force us to check them and

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,100
by this I don't just mean assumptions

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,350
about a topic but also assumptions about

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,680
what we do or what we don't know about

00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:24,430
something in software and in computer

00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,010
science and just generally encode

00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,850
the first and possibly largest hurdle

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:33,430
about solving any problem is

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:35,590
understanding what you don't know it's

00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:38,160
understanding the constraints of a topic

00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:41,620
the bounds the limitations of something

00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,600
including your own knowledge and this

00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:47,740
technique really forces us to confront

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,360
these facts head-on because only when

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,700
we're able to acknowledge the gaps in

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:56,260
our learning and in our knowledge can we

00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:58,570
really start filling those gaps Fineman

00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:02,980
famously once said that I'm smart enough

00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:07,570
to know that I'm dumb and I think this

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:09,850
is a really good example of how his

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,190
technique was pretty self compassionate

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:14,680
in a lot of ways especially when you're

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,020
learning something new the Fineman

00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,750
technique makes learning just a little

00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,250
bit easier because you're constantly

00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,410
reinforcing what you do know along the

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,750
way which can be super helpful when

00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,370
you're feeling very disheartened or lost

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,860
about a new topic that you're learning

00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:32,560
you end up you know with a filled

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,760
notebook possibly or a log of all the

00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,560
things you do know and then you

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,280
understand how to target your learning

00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,540
and understand how to grow in whatever

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,480
topic it is that you're trying to

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,220
improve upon but there's an even bigger

00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,610
reason why I think programmers in

00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:52,000
particular should use and could benefit

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:53,500
from the Fineman technique that's

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,310
because it teaches us to be better

00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:00,420
explainers by reframing our own mental

00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:03,220
model for learning into the context of

00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,350
explaining to others we actually start

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,540
to realize far more quickly we're our

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:11,110
own gaps are when it comes to our own

00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,910
teaching abilities phiman was known as

00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:15,310
the great explainer because before

00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:18,310
teaching any topic he would distill it

00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:20,590
down into its simplest parts and if he

00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,660
couldn't explain it simply he would go

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,850
back and try to understand so much more

00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,550
about the topic because that meant that

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:30,880
there wasn't enough knowledge in order

00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:32,740
to explain a concept simply his true

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,690
brilliance really came in my opinion

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:37,030
from the fact that he could explain

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:41,590
anything and make everything accessible

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:43,570
along the way and some of the lectures

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,670
that he gave at Caltech he actually

00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:50,760
specifically geared to students who had

00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:53,650
no background in theoretical physics in

00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,840
1964 he delivered a series of seven

00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,720
hour-long lectures at Cornell which were

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,660
recorded by the BBC and you can watch

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,240
all of these lectures for free and in

00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,410
all of them if you watch even a little

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,530
bit of them you'll see that he doesn't

00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:10,450
use theoretical jargon or mental

00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:13,090
gymnastics that a lot of other educators

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:16,900
or teachers probably would have used at

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:20,500
that time and maybe even today and those

00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,690
lectures are now the basis for the

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,730
foundations of physics in lots of

00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,550
physics programs in universities all

00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,260
around the world more than his

00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:32,500
contributions to physics and science and

00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:34,660
math fineman's technique and his life to

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:40,240
work shows us that making knowledge

00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:41,470
accessible opens doors for others he

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,480
opened the door for a lot of non

00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,820
academics and got people interested in

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:49,150
science and technology and engineering

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,320
and math and he helped people who

00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,630
thought that they weren't good at

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,350
certain topics feel like these were

00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,930
things that they could actually

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:58,320
understand and I think that this is

00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:03,370
particularly important in our industry

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:06,280
because tech needs more great explainers

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,170
just like Richard Fineman Tech is

00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,720
becoming more complicated and ubiquitous

00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:13,530
and it's more important now than ever

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,880
for everyone to understand how it works

00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,740
people tend to fear what they don't

00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,900
understand which means that a lot of

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,180
tech is scary to people that aren't in

00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,700
the industry right now so we need more

00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,770
approachable resources in order to get

00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,990
both creators and consumers of

00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:31,540
technology to understand how these tools

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:35,470
really work as well as what they're

00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:38,050
capable of and when people can see it as

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:41,770
a less daunting thing then they're more

00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:43,870
likely to enter the field as well and by

00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:45,910
opening tech up to the to more people

00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:49,120
the tech industry in general will

00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:51,160
come inherently more diverse if we can

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,250
reach people who are traditionally

00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,160
underrepresented in our industry then we

00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:00,280
can help bring new fresh diverse voices

00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,860
into the field and through accessible

00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,830
resources people who don't have access

00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,690
to a computer science education or might

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,730
not have a cs degree can still get

00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:13,360
access to the knowledge that they need

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:15,040
and this would mean that we'd also reach

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,200
all those people who want to learn

00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,350
something more but are struggling to

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,290
find the right resources if everyone in

00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:26,760
our industry started working towards

00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:29,290
becoming a better explainer we'd have

00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,200
ultimately a much wider variety of

00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:34,330
explanations for example if there had

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,340
been a better explanation of how radix

00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,290
trees worked then I probably wouldn't

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,890
have cried when I tried to learn about

00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:45,000
them last year and if everyone made

00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:47,680
teaching a part of the learning process

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,750
then grasping new concepts would

00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:54,040
probably be a whole lot more enjoyable

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:56,740
for all of us but of course it's not all

00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,680
selfless learning new things is

00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,260
empowering for yourself just ignoring

00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,370
the rest of the industry if you like

00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,290
learning keeps you in the loop about

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,970
what's happening in a field and it makes

00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:10,090
it easier when you want to learn a new

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:12,190
tool or framework for me learning the

00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,450
fundamentals of computer science meant

00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,180
that I stopped being afraid of

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,310
abstractions and I stopped being as

00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,470
afraid to look into the source code of

00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,990
how something worked and I stopped

00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,990
seeing things as magical black boxes

00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:28,600
because I started to understand the

00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:31,090
little pieces and the little concepts

00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,090
the building blocks of how things worked

00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:37,150
as a whole I started to see parts of the

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,970
whole and all of this made me far less

00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:41,620
afraid of changing my code and I think

00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:47,050
it's made me a better programmer at the

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:49,840
end of the day for it so there's one

00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:53,410
last question in that case how can each

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,140
of us become great explainers what are

00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,690
concrete ways that

00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:01,020
we could do these things to contribute

00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:03,390
to our own industry well if we create

00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,980
our own repositories of accessible

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,890
knowledge using the Fineman technique

00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,050
then that can look like a lot of

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,850
different things and I'm not saying that

00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,830
anybody should go and record hours and

00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:17,250
lectures it's probably okay if we had

00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:20,730
fewer of those but for some of us that

00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:22,590
might mean writing a blog post or for

00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,950
others it might mean adding some much

00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:27,510
needed documentation to a project where

00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:30,660
information and knowledge is really

00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:33,030
lacking and inaccessible and for others

00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,430
still that might mean pairing with a new

00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:37,320
engineer on the team in order to

00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,570
communicate and teach the concept that

00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:43,380
you have recently learned to make it

00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:46,290
just a little bit easier for them if we

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:49,020
all did this then we'd create something

00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,460
that would last so much longer after

00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,580
we've initially put it out into the

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,040
world we'd save so many future

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:59,250
generations the pain and the time of

00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:03,120
learning something without resources and

00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:05,550
maybe just maybe we'd even keep some

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,230
folks from getting so frustrated that

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:11,580
they end up leaving the industry

00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:14,790
altogether as fineman's life and his

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:18,300
work showed us making our own knowledge

00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:22,800
accessible can have amazing lasting

00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:26,430
impact if we were all better explainers

00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,740
then ultimately I think we leave the

00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:32,910
industry much better than when we found

00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:36,360
it and to me I really can't think of a

00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:38,420
much better contribution than that thank

00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,420
you

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,500
