Title: RustFest Paris 2018 -  Vector graphics rendering on the GPU in Rust with Lyon by Nicolas Silva
Publication date: 2018-05-26
Playlist: RustFest Paris 2018
Description: 
	Our next speaker, Nicholas, made
a vector thing that's worth the wait
A renderer for you
and your GPU
Now frenetic applause would be great

Lyon is a collection of low level tools to render 2D vector graphics on the GPU, useful for games as well as other applications benefiting from vector graphics (map renderers, web browsers, graphical user interfaces, creative coding, etc.). This presentation will start with a very short overview of the type of functionalities lyon provides, followed by a deep dive into how lyon approaches rendering and how it relates to other GPU based vector graphics rendering tools.
