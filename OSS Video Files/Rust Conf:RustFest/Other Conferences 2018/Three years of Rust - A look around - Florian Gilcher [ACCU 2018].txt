Description: 
	APOLOGIES FOR THE POOR AUDIO ON THIS TALK - SADLY A CABLE WAS LEFT UNTERMINATED AND THIS CAUSED A LOT OF DISTORTION AND FUZZ IN THE AUDIO RECORDING. WE HAVE TRIED TO CLEAN IT UP AS BEST WE CAN. 

In only three years, Rust came from a long way from being an interesting new research language to a productive language used by industry players such as Dropbox, Facebook and others.

Shortly before its third birthday, I’d like to take the chance to give an overview of the language. What do we have, what’s missing, what’s coming and what changed in the last three years?

A short introduction into the hallmark features of the language is included.

This talk will give a useful overview both to curious non-practitioners as well as seasoned Rustaceans.
