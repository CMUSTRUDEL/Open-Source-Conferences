okay it's one o'clock hello everybody

00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,700
welcome to our talk we're going to be

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,440
talking about rust and our the approach

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,880
to open source that we've been kind of

00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,240
discovering and experimenting with over

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,580
the years so I am nico misaki's and this

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,310
is aaron turin here's some outdated

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,269
pictures of us or at least of me from

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,070
github but one of the things you know

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,769
when we when the rust project started it

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,050
was originally and always envisioned as

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,960
an open project right but the definition

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,370
of open is kind of a little or a little

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,440
up in the air and and the reasons to be

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,510
open or maybe not entirely obvious right

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,100
I mean I think for us here at Mozilla

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,110
it's kind of clear that we should be

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,850
open because that's what we do and it's

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,460
part of who we are but I think there's

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,870
also a very practical benefit to

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,879
developing especially a programming

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,550
language but really any project probably

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,379
in the open I mean for rust it means

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,210
that we get to have the the input from

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,219
his wider variety of people as possible

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,660
and also that we get we have a better

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,729
chance of getting a lot of people using

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,140
rust which then means that if we use

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,299
rust in Mozilla then they're able to

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,549
contribute and help us with patches and

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,310
whatever else right but one of the

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,369
things we found is that open is also

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,650
just harder than you might expect and

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,900
there's a lot of unexpected at least for

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,890
me things that arose over time and that

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,030
we had to adjust and change our strategy

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,340
one of the things that we've been

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,700
progressively trying hard to do with

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,890
rust especially is to push the open

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,930
approach to as many aspects of the of

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,670
running a project as we can do as many

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,130
things and as wide and community

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,570
oriented away as possible and so it

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,490
started out I think the most obvious

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,280
things are like discussing the design

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,649
over a mailing list or in public hacking

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,540
on the compiler having PRS on tools and

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,000
other things and maybe library

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,040
development but you can go way past that

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,469
there's lots of stuff that that we are

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,750
now running kind of in the open and in

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,310
community oriented way right so things

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,790
like running our infrastructure and our

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,069
release process website maintenance and

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,869
also things like organizing of meetups

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,490
and conferences and the list goes on and

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,650
on right and

00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,810
this didn't happen all at once and in

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,030
the way that we ran the Russ project has

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,920
evolved a lot over the years in the very

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,310
beginning things like when I started

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,100
with 2011 we kind of had a core nucleus

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,360
of four or five employees and we had

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,350
this mailing list where we would talk

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,210
about stuff most of the time and we had

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,500
these work weeks where we would the

00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,600
employees would get together in hack on

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,340
stuff and sometimes and there were also

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,020
PRS coming from the outside but I think

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,000
a lot of the work was really driven both

00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,430
design and implementation by the

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,860
employees and one of the things that

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,600
happen is even amongst ourselves we were

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,580
distributed over different geographic

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,740
locations most of us were in Mountain

00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,350
View but there was graden in Vancouver

00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,020
and Mariah Nova and Berlin and and there

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,250
started to be sometimes I would say

00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,570
there would be tensions that arise

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,600
because the people in Mountain View

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,700
maybe would like come up with a design

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,530
on their own and it wouldn't be properly

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,560
communicated over the mailing list or

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,820
elsewhere and so then other people you

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,140
know if you weren't there locally you

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,770
wouldn't kind of come along on the

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,090
process and so that and that that just

00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,590
kind of if you try to scale that's

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,240
already a problem with like say five or

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,100
six people if you try to scale that up

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,440
so the whole internet you can imagine

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,620
that it starts to fracture one of the

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,320
specific things we had that we found was

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,630
sometimes problematic that we would get

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,670
PRS aiming to change the language so a

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,000
pull requests basically people would go

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,290
and implement a feature that they wanted

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,300
and it wasn't necessarily a feature that

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,320
we thought would be good for rust as a

00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,820
whole right it wasn't necessarily

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,410
following a coherent design and these

00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,930
people might come from the community or

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,340
sometimes it might be just one of us

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,040
kind of going help on their own right

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,200
this could happen and so in around

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,630
around the 1.0 time frame we made a big

00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,550
change one of the sort of very

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,040
consequential change or we introduced

00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,420
this RFC process which is basically if

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,990
you want to make a big change to rust

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,820
there was a formal way to where to post

00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,410
it and how to get feedback and make a

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,870
decision on whether to embark on that

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,880
change or not before our SES were

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,870
something we did but it was it was much

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,370
more much less formal

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,260
we would just send a link to the mailing

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,919
list and this was a great success

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,090
we no longer got these random PRS but we

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,260
did have this problem that now we

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,990
started to get kind of random our

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,940
sieze and people making proposals that

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,100
were all over the place and didn't

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,570
necessarily have a coherent theme and it

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:41,020
was hard to keep up with all the rfcs

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:42,910
too so we moved over time to more and

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,540
more of a process for example we

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,730
introduced Russ teams which are

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,170
essentially deep growing the leadership

00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,120
tremendously so that we can keep up with

00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,150
more RFC's and we can have more input

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,310
going way beyond employees to just

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,110
people who have been working very in the

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,030
project for a long time and had kind of

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,410
accumulated a lot of wisdom and we

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,540
introduced things like final comment

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,150
periods we'll talk about some of the

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,010
details here later but I think in terms

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,900
of the the random RFC problem one of the

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,270
big things we did was move to introduced

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,040
a roadmap which is essentially a special

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,050
RFC at the beginning of the year that

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,580
kind of sets the agenda and lets the

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,350
community decide what are our priority

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,120
is going to be going forward and then

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,550
helps us to decide on the other RFC's

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,640
and things that come up during the year

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:29,260
and it's not the end right this is what

00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,670
we've been doing so far I expect we're

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,070
going to keep changing and tweaking our

00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,350
process and our procedures but you can

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,530
see this is a graph of the number of

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,670
people and the rust governance teams

00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,170
starting when they first were

00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,850
established and going to the present day

00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,890
and you can see the effects of all these

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,150
changes now each time we we kind of

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,190
improve the way that we interact with

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,160
the community the teams grow bigger and

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:53,350
bigger and more essentially the the

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,820
number of participants is leaping and

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,190
we're really happy with that we're very

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,750
proud of it and I think it's pretty

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,140
interesting to see this comes up to over

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,790
a hundred here and there are seven

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,830
employees included in that list and the

00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,130
rest come from the outside right so

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:11,290
that's pretty great so that's kind of

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,000
the intro from here I'm going to hand it

00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,160
over to Aaron and he's going to talk

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,810
about this first two sections of why

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,850
wasn't I consulted and articulate the

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,200
vision so each of these sections is kind

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,120
of a little catchphrase that we've come

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,680
up with that kind of summarizes some of

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,150
the lessons that we've learned and then

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,550
I'll talk about the path to leadership

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:31,030
and we'll finish up so there you go

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,470
again thanks Nico yeah so the structure

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,350
of the rest of the talk is basically

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,840
going back through you know the timeline

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,200
that Nico just outlined and digging into

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,210
some of the formative stories

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,820
and and ideas that we pulled out of them

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,760
that you know now constitute part of

00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,280
Russ governance so the the first lesson

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,340
that we learned happened in the run-up

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,820
to rust 1.0 around the time that we were

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,730
starting to play with this RFC process

00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:03,540
and I think I joined the project right

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:08,610
up the cusp of this change so I joined

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,650
about a year before 1.0 and my job was

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,050
to essentially get the standard library

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,000
ready for one point out and just to give

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,160
you a little bit of the context here you

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,890
know because of the policy up to that

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,510
point of just these random PRS the the

00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,100
standard library had just kind of

00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,570
accreted over time like there were

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,530
definitely a lot of good things about it

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,660
but there was a lot of inconsistencies

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,720
and it wasn't clear that we wanted

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,280
everything that was there but with 1.0

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,520
we were gonna start making promises that

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,400
okay we're committing to these api's so

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,440
a big part of my job was developing a

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,480
process where the community could come

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,390
together and actually make these final

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,370
decisions about what would ship and I

00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,760
made some missteps in the beginning of

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:53,310
that so this particular story one of the

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,790
first sort of interesting community

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,010
experiences I had you know we we had

00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,380
developed you know the beginnings of

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,880
this library process and went through it

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,190
for certain api's and if you've used

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,470
rust you've probably heard of unwrapped

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,240
and we were proposing to rename it to

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,150
assert you probably have opinions about

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,410
this if you use rust and so we we

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,480
followed this process that we had laid

00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,190
out and I made a pull request and then I

00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,450
started getting all these interesting

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,670
comments on the pull request basically

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,460
saying wait a second like you're

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,560
renaming this fundamental thing when did

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,910
this happen and also you're you're

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,590
pointing to these guidelines over here

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,690
that are justifying this change but you

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,010
wrote those and committed those to like

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:36,630
what's going on you know and being you

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,729
know might at the time very naive so the

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,860
stuff I was saying well we had a process

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,330
you know as a community we decided there

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,060
we were going to do this thing and and

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,170
we had a meeting and in the meeting we

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,550
talked about all the points that people

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,310
were making on this thread and we came

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,110
to this decision and then you can guess

00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,769
what happens right so if you've if

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,239
you've been spent any time

00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:57,489
on the Internet in any kind of comment

00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:59,949
forums you will have seen the kind of

00:08:57,489 --> 00:09:01,949
explosion that that can happen with you

00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:06,009
know with this kind of course of events

00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:09,309
so older wiser Nico stepped in and saved

00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:12,339
my butt and basically after 80 comments

00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:15,819
on this thread said all right we hear

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,839
you we understand that you know people

00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:19,360
didn't feel like they had sufficient

00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:23,709
input so we're gonna go back to the

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,199
drawing board and use a sort of more

00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,929
broadcast process with this request for

00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,850
comments where it's very clear like okay

00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:33,879
this is under discussion now here is the

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:36,309
place to you know state your opinion and

00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,259
and weigh in and we'll reach a decision

00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:41,019
there and it was fascinating if you look

00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:42,429
back at this thread the moment that nico

00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:44,769
said that all of these people who had

00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:46,600
been complaining you know we're first of

00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:50,049
all grateful but also expressed like a

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,749
sense of trust in the rust process and

00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:55,239
not that's a recurring theme as we go

00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:57,579
through things here so of course I can't

00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:58,679
let nico come off looking like the good

00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:02,709
guy here

00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:05,499
so fast forward a bit to now just a few

00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:07,629
months before 1.0 and by this time we

00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:09,429
had gone through the vast majority of

00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:10,990
the standard library we had gotten you

00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:12,999
know pretty good at at this process and

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,720
other parts of the language too but

00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:19,240
there are a lot of details to get nailed

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,399
down before shipping so there was this

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,019
one particular issue of what we called

00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,959
certain integer types and the details

00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:28,899
don't really matter but it was something

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,939
we the leadership of rust knew this was

00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,679
a hotly debated topic there was a github

00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:33,790
thread with a couple hundred comments

00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:37,689
about it over the course of a couple

00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:40,269
years and we just didn't think it was a

00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:42,639
big deal but we knew that we needed to

00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:45,069
make a decision and so we were doing our

00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,499
due diligence and we read the thread and

00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:50,199
we you know had conversations and again

00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:51,879
a meeting and then Nico wrote this long

00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:54,519
and beautiful blog post that contained

00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:57,369
some very important little phrases like

00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,799
we've come to a final decision right and

00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:01,209
this post just came out of the blue as

00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,449
far as the community was concerned right

00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:05,919
there was this whole thread and then

00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:07,330
leadership steps in and says we've read

00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,980
your thread over here

00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:13,720
and we believe we've come to a decision

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:17,920
now and same story she massive explosion

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,470
and I'm forever indebted to a member of

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,480
the Russ community Gabor who has

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,320
consistently held our feet to the fire

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,000
and but Gabor there was a pivotal moment

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,649
in this story where he really

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,649
articulated the problem with how things

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,540
were progressing and it's basically that

00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,370
we have this two-level system of

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,870
discussion there's the community you all

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,240
can you know talk over here in this

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,730
thread but then the leadership that's

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
actually going to make decisions they

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,550
don't have to make the arguments

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,500
beforehand in this thread they can kind

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,140
of swoop in and and just handle hand

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,560
them down and that didn't feel right to

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:57,370
people and indeed I think it leads to

00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,029
worse outcomes right so so you who died

00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:03,370
here was the savior in this case and

00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:04,480
basically same story we we stepped back

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,190
we said we're gonna go back to the

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,660
drawing board go through an RC process

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:12,850
and participate fully front to back and

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,950
in both of these stories the ultimate

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,959
decision that shipped in 1.0 was the

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:20,440
opposite of what the leadership team was

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,390
proposing at first so and that's not

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,709
just you know because we were trying to

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,720
please the community like we actually

00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:30,430
worked through the debate and came to

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,570
agree so so those are those are sort of

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,540
some background stories and I'm sure

00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,209
you've seen similar stories play out and

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,240
communities you've been involved in

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:42,070
there's a great essay called the web is

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,589
a customer service medium and by Paul

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:49,870
Ford and part of the idea of this essay

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:51,880
is that as as a kind of media the thing

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,620
that the web is uniquely good at is

00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,930
answering the question why wasn't I

00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,730
consulted okay like when people get

00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,620
really passionate about the Internet it

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:03,490
tends to be around these kinds of open

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:05,920
forums fandoms communities where there's

00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,149
a sense of empowerment that you actually

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,350
have a voice you can actually have

00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:14,350
influence and you know there you can see

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,839
this in a few lights on the one hand

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,610
it's amazing to get such a diversity of

00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,560
input you know

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,899
and we'll talk later about how much that

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,880
can help on the other hand I think there

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:27,010
is sometimes a sense of almost an

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,810
entitlement that well my you know my

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,339
opinion that I came up with in five

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,120
minutes matters as much as you know

00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:32,800
these people who have been thinking

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,440
about it for weeks right so it's a it's

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,510
a tough balance but for better or worse

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,269
I think this is indeed a fundamental

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,220
part of life online and life in the open

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:46,329
and so any open source project has to

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:48,459
grapple with this problem so in the Rust

00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:51,250
world we've already sort of started

00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:54,640
talking about the ways that we tackle

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:57,670
consultation so the big idea is the

00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,130
request for comment process and there's

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:03,130
been a an arc over time where more and

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:06,040
more kinds of decisions come under the

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,339
the RFC process so you know it started

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,290
just for court language features then

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,360
included library things and now we use

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,720
it for talking about you know what web

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,209
browser is kraits IO should support or

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,829
you know community events even or you

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:22,660
know all kinds of things anything is

00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:25,089
fair game anytime we need to make a

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,660
decision together and so the goal is

00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:31,630
you're getting your inviting input from

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:34,449
the whole world which is very chaotic

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:37,390
and you know hard to structure well but

00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:38,800
we have these teams that are the

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,240
ultimate decision makers in each of

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,740
these areas and part of their

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,839
responsibility is to help guide the

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,449
discussion productively and so the goal

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,390
is not that everybody's opinion

00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:52,180
necessarily gets the same wait it's not

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,160
like a voting democracy kind of thing

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,610
it's more that we're collectively

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,370
exploring a space of trade-offs and it

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,320
really is just incredible how you can

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,180
consider yourself a deep expert in an

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,339
area and some you know Rando on the

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,510
Internet can show up and surprise you

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,760
with the point that you never would have

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:12,250
considered right so so the process is

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,589
first of all this exploration of what

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,839
are the options what are the trade-offs

00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:19,149
and then at some point that reaches more

00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,620
or less a steady state and that doesn't

00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:22,839
mean that everybody involved in the

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,750
thread has reached the same consensus in

00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,480
fact that usually doesn't happen but at

00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:32,810
least we agree on the contours of the

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,790
decision and at that point then the

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,470
we'll sort of start to head toward a

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,210
decision proposed to move a certain

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,580
direction either accepting or rejecting

00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,050
the RFC and then as a Nico mentioned

00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,330
there's a final comment period one last

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,800
advertisement for to make sure we didn't

00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,130
we don't cause any why wasn't I

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,520
consulted problems and then a key lesson

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:54,590
with all of this and this is coming from

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,930
those earlier stories especially the

00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:59,630
great int debate is that when the team

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:02,300
does finally make a decision that

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,520
decision has to be based on argument

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,590
that already played out on the threat it

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,940
can't you can't simultaneously make a

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,560
decision and be making brand new

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,860
arguments that nobody's had a chance to

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:15,110
respond to so you know at this point

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,060
this stuff feels pretty basic I think to

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,980
the Russ community like we've we've been

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,940
operating in this way for three years

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,130
now

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,840
but it was hard to get there and you

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,450
know I think there are a lot of

00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,150
trade-offs here it it's really tiring to

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:31,280
deal with the droves of people coming in

00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,400
and it can be really slow but this is

00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,110
how we do it and I want to contrast that

00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,780
with you know there are lots of other

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,300
schools of thought around how to do open

00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,280
source and I certainly am not claiming

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,170
that the rust way is the only way or

00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,480
even the best way I think it works well

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,900
for what we're trying to do but to try

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,670
to draw this contrast explicitly so you

00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,500
know the Apache Software Foundation has

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,540
a lot of guidance around how to run up

00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,370
in source projects and they talked in

00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,960
explicit terms about doing something

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,930
very unlike what we're doing in rust

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,209
where basically you contribute just by

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,560
you write some code you you think you

00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:08,350
have an idea you think you know what the

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,500
community wants you write some code and

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:12,620
if nobody sees the code and it lands

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,530
congratulations

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,870
like nobody objected it's fine and then

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,880
and the the rationale if you read these

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,430
documents they say it's all under source

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,430
control so you know if if people get

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,260
upset later you can back it out and me

00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:29,000
you know like I say this may work for

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,920
some communities but we could never get

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,960
away with this and rust Norman or would

00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,390
we want to and so in some sense the RFC

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,820
process is the diametric opposite of

00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:40,490
this it's eager consensus around all

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,970
major decisions and it's a lot of work

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,230
but I think for for us we're really you

00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,480
know

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,950
we're looking for the long-term we're

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,330
wanting to get these things right and so

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:55,690
we're willing to pay these these costs

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:58,840
so that was the lead up to 1.0 and some

00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,559
of those basic lessons but we had a lot

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,179
more to learn

00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:05,139
even after we shipped the first version

00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:07,419
of rust and I think a big part of what

00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:10,600
we had to learn was how to effectively

00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:12,909
herd cats and of course this is a common

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,710
mimin and open source and it ties back

00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:17,440
with you know people sending random PRS

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,120
in rfcs and so on but I just I

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,360
distinctly remember in the months after

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,639
1.0 this feeling of what's next

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,740
like as a community we had enormous

00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:29,740
energy around shipping 1.0 is a clear

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,179
goal and then after we did it there were

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,450
so many things we could work on it and

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:36,880
it was really unclear what should happen

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,889
and the community felt this as well this

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,350
is just you know a tiny smattering of

00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:43,179
posts that were going around at this

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,159
time and I love you know these put this

00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:46,750
is very typical right somebody comes in

00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,970
and they're like why is this entire

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,679
project not focused on my number one

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,809
priority I don't understand

00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,070
and of course then there you know post

00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:57,039
of the same type arguing for a

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:59,529
completely different priority and you

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,159
know it was kind of a mess so I'm gonna

00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:05,080
pick on Nikko again you know so

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,909
recognizing this we thought well as the

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,130
leadership team we have a better

00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:11,289
perspective on all of this so clearly we

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:15,340
can write one of these posts and that'll

00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:16,720
fix it right and and indeed we did see a

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,700
bigger picture than most of the other

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,539
people that were complaining but that

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:25,840
was kind of the problem

00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:28,779
so this ended up just being a really

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,250
long laundry list and I don't I don't

00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:32,260
want to pick on Nikko too much here in

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,539
this sense that virtually everything on

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,610
this list has actually been a priority

00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:38,139
over these last three years many of them

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,899
are completed many of them are still

00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:43,419
underway so on a technical level we

00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:47,620
weren't wrong but this was not an

00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:49,870
effective way to herd cats right and so

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,789
here I want to draw out another contrast

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,940
with conventional wisdom and open source

00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:56,919
and I think you know there is a lot of

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,710
wisdom here that when you're talking

00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,809
about valen

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,120
years spending dedicating time on a

00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:04,669
project they're doing so because there's

00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,159
some passion there's some connection and

00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:09,140
so you have to sort of work with that

00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:13,309
intrinsic motivation right you can't

00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:15,679
tell them what to do but I think you

00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:16,880
don't have to be fatalistic about this

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,529
this doesn't mean you just have to

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,730
accept that people are gonna come in

00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:23,770
with random stuff and you got to figure

00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:26,270
out how to plug it in we try to sort of

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,490
you know thread the needle I guess

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:30,620
between having a clear direction and

00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,630
vision but still being inclusive to

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,700
everybody's individual motivations and

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,309
so that that comes down to this idea of

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,929
articulating the vision and in a way

00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:40,520
this is a counterpoint to the RFC

00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:42,740
process right so we have this open

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,419
consultation and we focused a lot on how

00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,279
the final decision is made and the role

00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:49,100
that the leaders play there at the very

00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,659
end basically but there's also a really

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,970
important role for leaders leaders to

00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:56,149
play much earlier in the process before

00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:57,799
rfcs or even being written and and that

00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:00,409
is articulating a vision right or

00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,059
thought leadership and this takes a huge

00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:04,399
variety of shapes

00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:06,500
so sometimes it's writing a blog post

00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:08,960
that's talking about a way of thinking

00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,450
about certain classes of design problems

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,149
you write that post and then you see

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,039
echoes of that in RFC threads later like

00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:19,610
you've you've actually communicated and

00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:22,010
a design approach or sometimes these are

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,570
inspirational things or aspirational and

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,840
you're saying you know rust should look

00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:29,240
like this and it's it's not always

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,549
forward-looking and a lot of times what

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,950
happens is we've done a lot of work

00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:36,260
together and only in hindsight do we

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,419
understand what that work actually added

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,669
up to be and what what the values were

00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:42,409
and it's still really important for for

00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:44,330
leaders to pinpoint that and and

00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:47,419
communicate it back to the community and

00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:50,059
that becomes part of the sort of axioms

00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:51,799
by which the community operates so and

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,419
again this is in contrast to show me the

00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,710
code you know this approach of everybody

00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:57,919
should just write code that's all that

00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:01,520
matters so to make this a little more

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:05,210
concrete and we started doing this

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,610
around 1.0 where we had a whole bunch of

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,980
blog posts that had this shape X without

00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,280
Y and there's a lot of reasons that that

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:15,120
works well for rust

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,430
but these these were pithy slogans that

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,830
captured big chunks of what rust was

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:22,200
about in a way that people could you

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,640
know that resonated with people that was

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,550
simple to understand that we could all

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,620
sort of come together around and that

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,570
would get us roughly pointed in a common

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,520
direction so that we were just working

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,140
out the details rather than everybody

00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,970
writing these posts about going off in

00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,660
completely different directions and then

00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,190
more recently in 2017 you know we had a

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,290
slogan on the roadmap fast reliable

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,330
productive pick three the idea being

00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,590
fast and reliable were like the themes

00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,200
of 1.0 and now we want to add

00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:52,280
productivity right and so you compare

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,810
that kind of slogan to this miles long

00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,880
post you know that we started out with

00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:00,420
after 1.0 and I think this is just far

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:04,830
more effective and so Nikko already

00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:06,900
mentioned was it was a nice poster Nikko

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,730
already mentioned the the roadmap

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:12,570
process and that's the way that we've

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,980
formalized this idea so you know I mean

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,420
there's there's a lot of vision

00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,850
articulation that happens separately

00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:21,360
from this but we come together each year

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:24,030
as a community and set out some

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,150
high-level slogans basically some really

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:29,580
product focused and goals that we want

00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:32,100
for a given year and that sets the stage

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:35,790
for the RFC process throughout the rest

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,530
of the year and so the idea is if you're

00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:40,320
effective and inspiring people this way

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:42,810
then they will naturally have sort of

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,900
itches to scratch that fall along these

00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:48,480
same dimensions and if they don't you

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,510
have a much easier time saying no or not

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,400
yet right that this this proposal makes

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,920
sense but it's not part of our 2018

00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,240
focus and that's that's a really hard

00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,350
thing an open source you know if you

00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,970
have a huge community how do you

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,220
actually stay focused you you only have

00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:06,240
so much design bin width you can't take

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:10,340
everything and we use the RFC process

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,620
itself to determine the road map and

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,110
there's one more sort of aspect to to

00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:19,340
all of this that I've been thinking

00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:23,040
about a lot recently which is you know

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:25,140
despite there's this tension right that

00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,750
on the one hand

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:30,870
we want a highly inclusive diverse

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:33,000
community and to reach a variety of

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,140
audiences that fundamentally means not

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,410
everybody's going to have the same

00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,380
values or interpretations of shared

00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:42,150
values but at the same time it's really

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,610
important that the product at the end of

00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,800
the day has a clearer and coherent

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:49,530
vision right and so balancing between

00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,200
those two things is pretty tricky and

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,010
the idea is the way we handle this is

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,750
basically by having the teams that are

00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,400
you know informally articulating the

00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,800
vision and then formally at the end of

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,500
the process making decisions and their

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,410
responsibility is both to take into

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,750
account all the diversity of ideas that

00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:12,390
we're seeing on these threads but then

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:15,570
condense them down to an actual coherent

00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:18,510
product vision in the end it's a tall

00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:22,230
order and we mess up a lot but that's

00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:24,240
that's the goal and with that so I just

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,250
want to add one thing about articulating

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,080
the vision before I go into this one of

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,290
the ways that there were one of the

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,450
aspects of it for me that I see is that

00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,950
in that big long post I laid out a lot

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,630
of reasoning and it would have been

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,100
better to put it in smaller pieces not

00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,840
only because it'd be easier to remember

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,320
but because people will read it and

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,970
respond to it and they will direct and

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,130
help me direct myself because

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,270
essentially I think I have a good idea

00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,580
what the vision is but it turns out that

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,290
in that like in all things the community

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,570
is very wise and there's a lot for me to

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,910
learn and indirect and so basically I

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,170
see the vision it's it's in one sense

00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,580
the leaders articulating it but it's

00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,500
also the community echoing or not

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,390
echoing it back and then she and leaders

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,980
you know shaping it so together we are

00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,240
finding what the vision is and putting

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,250
it into practice and I think that's

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,540
important to see that it goes both ways

00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:14,100
it's not just top-down but when this

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,090
section of the talk I want to talk about

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:21,030
the path to leadership and this means a

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,250
lot of things as we'll see I mean but

00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,780
basically it's about if there are people

00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,580
who want to contribute and get involved

00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,410
in the community how can we make sure

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,240
that it's as easy for them as possible

00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:31,860
how can we put as few roadblocks in

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,860
their way and take whatever energy they

00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:37,200
have to invest can we find a place and a

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,770
way to channel it so that they're having

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,810
a good time

00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:44,010
and are satisfied and the project is

00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:46,200
making progress right and I think this

00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,600
begins sort of at many levels the most

00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,740
obvious one is something like how do you

00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,170
help someone who wants to contribute

00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,000
like a patch or a PR and I think many of

00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,410
us who have experimented with

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,670
open-source projects have probably at

00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,140
some point had the experience of like

00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:01,080
I'd like to learn how this works

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,330
let me go clone it okay there's a lot of

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,280
code here you know maybe I'll look for

00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,990
main and then main is in a macro and you

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,640
can't actually find main and I don't

00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,050
know like venues they're armed to go

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,600
just I'll go play a video game I don't

00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,490
know whatever something else and it

00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,140
applies to issues right so if you have

00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:19,560
an issue you can't really read this but

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,810
it's talking about something properly

00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,190
named the exposed memory constant and

00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,960
the point is if you have an issue that

00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,940
just says what the problem is it doesn't

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,380
give any hints about how to get involved

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,850
it's kind of the same scenario when

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,030
someone wants to fix this they have to

00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:36,060
just find out where in the code to go

00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:38,370
and hopefully they know and actually one

00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,480
there's a really great contributor to

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,430
the compiler who works a lot on

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,260
Diagnostics estaban coober and one of

00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,750
the things he told me was the reason he

00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,490
works on Diagnostics is because he can

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,870
go to the issue find the error message

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,850
that's not good and grep through the

00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:54,300
source and like have a place to start

00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:57,090
right and that's just like way better

00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,620
than many other issues but we can solve

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,300
that problem even if there's no string

00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,430
right so this issue is actually by Olly

00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,900
who's right there and he didn't stop it

00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,930
here he kept going and he gave some

00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,340
instructions on how to fix the problem

00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,230
you know he says look we should rename

00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,690
this variable to that and so forth and

00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,240
sure enough just a few days after filing

00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,820
the issue somebody opened up ER and

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,350
fixed it and my experience has been you

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,450
can have an issue with no instructions

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,650
it will sit there for years easily and

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,870
nobody touches it

00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,790
you put instructions it will get closed

00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,920
you know possibly within hours it's

00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,360
tough it's happened to me so it's just

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,420
it really makes a light a night-and-day

00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,870
difference right and I what I'm trying

00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:38,750
to do now is well not just me but what I

00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,160
would like to see happen is is to push

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,150
beyond just instructions in issues

00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,440
because often when you write those

00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,660
instructions what you realize you're

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,240
doing is essentially documenting the

00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,500
code explaining a sort of slice of the

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,900
code here's how this part of it works

00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,340
here's the where you would need to make

00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,100
Changez and some of that you will always

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,980
have to do but a lot of is repetitive

00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:00,230
and so I'm trying to extract and build

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,990
up a document that describes the

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,780
compiler and gives a guide to how it's

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:08,000
different parts work if you compare say

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,860
this directory listing of the compiler

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,030
which is kind of what you get now - if

00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:15,260
you want to get an overview of how it

00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:16,730
works - this this markdown document with

00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,780
a table of contents you can already get

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,300
a feeling for how much more manageable

00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,160
it feels even even me who's been working

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,510
on the compiler for six years when I

00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,150
look at this table of contents I'm

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,650
suddenly feel like oh there it is it's

00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:31,250
right there it's all laid out it makes

00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,810
sense and so that I think I hope we can

00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,810
keep finding new ways to kind of make it

00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:37,430
easier to get involved right but does

00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,530
some extent this is like conventional

00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,150
wisdom right and I think I don't know if

00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,200
you're actually doing this but this is

00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,460
how I would react if I were in the

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,830
audience and someone was telling me when

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,660
I'm telling them telling you and I was

00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,980
told last night when we gave a dry run

00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,270
of this talk sort of at the RUS meetup

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:54,950
that I have to act this out so I'm and

00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:56,120
do that now I don't want to hear this

00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,400
anymore

00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,990
after all honestly I learned a lot of

00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,120
this from people who are in the audience

00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,530
like Josh Matthews right and many other

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,720
people who write on the internet and so

00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,970
forth and so for example this is the

00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,710
bugs ahoy a website that Josh and others

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,510
pioneered and it helps you find places

00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:14,830
to contribute to Firefox and we have

00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:17,780
similar things like find bugs and so on

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,310
but these problems a lot of this stuff

00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,900
here is is actually just kind of the

00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:22,730
first step right it's all oriented it

00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,650
how do I take someone who's kind of

00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,030
interested in contributing and get them

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,070
to their first PR with the minimum

00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,500
amount of friction but there is another

00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:34,040
question of once they've made a PR or

00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,930
maybe a few PRS how can I keep keep it

00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,870
enjoyable and keep them engaged right

00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:41,900
and and to move on to becoming a sort of

00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:44,240
regular contributor and for that I've

00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,740
been thinking a lot or we've been we've

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,180
been working on this kind of working

00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,680
group idea and the idea is that we have

00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,990
essentially a group that's dedicated to

00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,940
producing two things first a piece of

00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,830
code or a goal that they're trying to

00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,380
achieve and secondly a community around

00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,640
that around getting that done people who

00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,520
know how that code works or people

00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:07,580
who've helped each other to get it done

00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,590
and there's a lot of question marks

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,260
still on just what a working group

00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:13,790
should be and how it should function and

00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,940
I think we're all experimenting with

00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:19,730
different strategies here but some parts

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,360
seem clearer all right you want to have

00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:25,280
like a leader that or leaders they're

00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,690
essentially looking for laying out the

00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,670
overall strategy is looking for

00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:30,170
opportunities to to break up tasks into

00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,240
smaller tasks and farm them out and

00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:34,340
doing a lot of mentoring and helping

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,740
people to grow expertise the idea is

00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,390
that if you do several PRS in the same

00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,010
area several different contributions

00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,360
they're kind of building on one another

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:43,010
right and you're using the knowledge you

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,500
had from the previous time to push you

00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:48,380
on to the next one you want to have

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,059
regular meetings so that people can

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,070
collaborate and have a sort of shared

00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:54,200
channel that that that is dedicated to

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:57,080
this working group I found text-based

00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,150
meetings is the best because of language

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,910
barrier issues basically and also just

00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,220
video sync is hard to arrange but

00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,450
basically all of this stuff is kind of

00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,400
up in the air as I said but the key

00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,290
thing is to make it a group that helps

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,640
one another and that is all working

00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,230
towards a common goal and it gives

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,270
people a sort of sense of community and

00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,460
a chance to be part of some feature that

00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:19,580
you know is exciting or a chance as part

00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,929
of some sort of focused group a smaller

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,309
piece of identity that it's easier to

00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:24,620
get into

00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:26,720
so it's essentially like if you think

00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,679
about the compiler as a whole or Firefox

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,710
as a whole that might be very

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,720
intimidating but if you think about some

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,400
specific part that is what you work on

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,830
and you own that there's a very

00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:40,160
different feeling right and that's what

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,420
we're shooting for and there are some

00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,520
techniques that have come up

00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,190
basically like strategies for

00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,860
subdividing tasks out so for example a

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:51,020
quest issue if you have a task which is

00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,000
not that hard to do but it has to be

00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,830
done many many many times you can

00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,990
distribute this relatively easily by

00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,370
writing up some instructions making up a

00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,630
checklist of all the places it needs to

00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,070
be done and then kind of putting out a

00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,600
call right and it's a great way to get

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,000
people involved because usually these

00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,679
tasks are like low barrier to entry they

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,950
update some test files or fix this

00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:12,170
formatting issue or something and it can

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,720
really sort of be an easy way to

00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:17,320
advertise out but other times you have

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,740
something that is much

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,870
more complex and in that case you might

00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,930
prefer to use sort of like a skeleton

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:29,230
approach where you lay out essentially

00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:31,180
an end-to-end design that kind of works

00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,290
but has many many holes right

00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,270
it doesn't really handle all the hard

00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,860
cases and you leave those and try to

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,870
mentor them out and get people to work

00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,120
on them and fill them in and and

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,640
basically work towards the goal of this

00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,470
thing actually working for real and

00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:48,040
along the way documenting helps and

00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:49,660
other steps and this is proven pretty

00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,310
successful so in the rust compiler for

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,290
example I think the mirror which is our

00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,890
new intermediate representation not so

00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:57,010
new anymore

00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:59,350
so feels new to me the transition to

00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,330
mirror kind of worked in this way so we

00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:03,940
got a fake PR that could handle like

00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:06,340
hello world got that landed that was

00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,740
just sort of me and maybe Eddie I forget

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,990
kind of pushing through and then from

00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,490
there people started jumping in and we

00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:14,050
didn't really have this idea as formally

00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,790
then it just happened organically that

00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,290
there were these holes and people wanted

00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,600
to help and they started filling them

00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:25,090
right but it can be a really effective

00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:27,700
technique and this stuff starts to apply

00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:29,500
I think a key lesson that we have

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,929
learned is that there are so many more

00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:35,260
tasks that people want to do and can do

00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:37,649
that are not writing code this ranges

00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:40,419
from things like bisecting regressions

00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:42,310
minimizing bug reports and so on all the

00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:44,470
way down to things like scheduling

00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:47,139
meetings and taking minutes and one of

00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,820
the problems I think that are just

00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:50,669
around these days is that these tests

00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,980
are not all necessarily valued equally

00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:56,290
and so for example scheduling a meeting

00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,850
organizing a doodle poll isn't something

00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:00,670
you can put on your resume like opening

00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,320
a PR but it's probably as important or

00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,790
more important to keeping the project

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,290
moving right and it's something that

00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,510
especially if you are trying to do it

00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:12,490
many many times you could really use

00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:14,530
help with so this this raises this

00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:18,250
question and this part of the talk I

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,900
think is definitely sort of very much a

00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,960
work in progress trying to figure out

00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,430
how can we we have some ideas you know

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,660
that that are well-known from from rust

00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,130
and elsewhere on how to get people

00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,320
involved help them write code or

00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,660
contribute or or do whatever tasks

00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,599
they're trying to do but

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,130
can we distribute this leadership this

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,799
top level the ones who kind of parcel

00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,180
out the tasks or set this up and I think

00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:41,069
there's really not a super easy answer

00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,809
here I mean some of it is leadership

00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:44,039
takes a lot of time and if you have

00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:47,480
volunteers they don't necessarily have

00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:49,650
that time to put in so maybe helping

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,720
people to advocate it their jobs for

00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,930
time to work on the project so forth is

00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,089
a good strategy but that's hard to do

00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:58,410
another thing though I mean that's all

00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:00,119
things we would love to do but we found

00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,460
that there are some simpler steps you

00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:05,940
can do that are also effective one of

00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,980
them is just don't get in the way as it

00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,720
turns out that actually there at least

00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,579
in at least in our experience there's a

00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,660
lot of leadership potential out there

00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:16,950
that people don't necessarily they don't

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,480
necessarily know how to contribute but

00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,640
they have the energy to do it if if

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,109
there's space made for them so an

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,770
example I would like to use or I use a

00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:27,780
lot is uh that I'd say if it was at two

00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,569
years ago one year ago about this long

00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,900
yeah yeah if you'd asked me then who is

00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:35,940
our release and kind of infrastructure

00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,460
or management team I would say oh that

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,049
was Alex Crichton he did all that and

00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,579
that's because Alex is an amazing

00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:45,779
multitasker he can do a lot of things

00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:47,789
but you know it was tiring for him and

00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:50,069
if you ask that same question now these

00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:52,170
are our teams right we've built up two

00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:54,930
teams of contributors and volunteers and

00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:58,890
they're led by respectively simulacrum

00:36:54,930 --> 00:37:00,539
and Aiden HS which is their user names I

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,000
have to look at their actual names mark

00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:05,789
simulacrum and Aiden Hobson Sayers two

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,220
excellent people and you know all this

00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:10,049
energy was there but what was missing

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,460
was we didn't make the space and say

00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:13,319
like we would like people to help us

00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,490
manage the release in the infrastructure

00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,809
process we kind of thought that was

00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,329
something nobody would want to do and

00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:19,680
therefore Alex had to do it and it turns

00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:20,970
out it's an interesting task with a lot

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,670
of details and a lot of room to improve

00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:26,010
and actually our process is much better

00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,210
now than it was you know two years ago

00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,750
because we have all these creative

00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:32,819
people working on it and we've been

00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,440
doing that kind of across the board so

00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:36,359
the RUS team structure started out

00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,010
fairly flat we had this core team and

00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,750
then a laying and a compiler and docks

00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:43,680
and libs I were like five teams I think

00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,220
maybe six but now we've been adding

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,750
level

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,609
and levels right so just on this slide

00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,859
which is not even complete remotely

00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:50,580
complete I have I don't know 10 or

00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:52,170
something

00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,910
there are lots and lots of teams and

00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:56,369
working groups and each one of them has

00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:58,590
leaders and people involved right and by

00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:59,700
making more levels more people come

00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,160
because there's more space for them to

00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:05,190
fill so this is a really important

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,890
lesson that we've learned it I think

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:10,050
another place where we use this was in

00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,630
the language design area so the team

00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,440
that kind of makes those decisions

00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,450
traditionally had a pretty simple

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,000
structure there was like people who

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,050
commented on threads and RFC's and stuff

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,040
and then there were the members of the

00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,720
team right and there were these two

00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,990
levels and some people commented a lot

00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,250
but and every once in a while someone

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:29,400
would join the team but we didn't have

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:31,680
kind of roles in between formal roles

00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,630
that people could play and so now we've

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,210
been working on creating some so we have

00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,859
for example in a given area we might

00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,630
have a meeting and in that meeting we

00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,310
don't invite just the members of the

00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,660
team we take the members of the team who

00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,970
care about that area and we take the

00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,650
people who've been commenting a lot and

00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,940
making him cite for comments about that

00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,070
area and bring them together and just

00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,470
focus on that it's kind of like a sub

00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:54,630
informal sub team right there right

00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,690
or we have a shepherd role for people

00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,980
who aren't on the team fully but they're

00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:00,420
helping to guide conversations and they

00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,060
join the meetings and and kind of

00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,560
participate as equals and this has been

00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:07,099
a good way for us to grow the team I

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,810
think we could do more of this

00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:13,320
but overall the key the key point is

00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:15,089
that we need to make and think about the

00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,859
paths from which people enter the

00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:18,780
project and that's not just the first PR

00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:21,060
it's not just the second PR it's kind of

00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,980
all the way as far as they are willing

00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,080
to go ideally right we would like them

00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,550
to go as far as they as they can in

00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,680
terms of leadership and and being

00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,869
involved and that might not be always

00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,000
the same path so some people might start

00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,589
by writing code and go from there to

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,119
organizing and leadership but there are

00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:38,609
other people for whom they might go

00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,599
directly to kind of organizing and

00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,880
leadership right they don't necessarily

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,690
have to be someone who writes PRS to

00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,420
help guide language design or to help

00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:51,720
organize a working group and I think we

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,980
know that in sort of companies you hire

00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,960
managers you don't necessarily always

00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,920
take a manager or take a person and

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,780
bring them up through the levels

00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,280
you might hire a manager directly but in

00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,290
open-source it's a little trickier and

00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,180
we're still wrestling around that I

00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:08,500
think so the takeaways basically is that

00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,690
put yourself in the shoes of someone

00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,690
who's contributing think about the paths

00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:16,330
turn them ideally from not just cow path

00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,800
sort of but actual roads that are really

00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,660
easy to paddle down and the more

00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,700
structure you can give I think a certain

00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,760
extent the better because people will

00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:27,040
feel invited to participate right and in

00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,930
particular think also about going beyond

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,790
just contributing in code and other ways

00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:34,300
that people contribute this has been

00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:35,670
what's been really helpful for us so now

00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,380
I'll leave it to Aaron to have the

00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:41,920
depressing low note at the end I mean

00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:44,650
the things we're still working yeah so I

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,820
think one interesting facet of all of

00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,970
these lessons we've been talking about

00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:50,890
is they've created new batches of

00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:54,100
problems that we're not even possible

00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:57,340
before and they're good problems to have

00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:59,650
but they are nonetheless problems and

00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,210
you know I think this is one you know

00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,190
for those of you involved in the rest

00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:05,230
community this kind of thing will ring

00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:07,090
true like oK we've got this great open

00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:10,060
inclusive RFC process where we want to

00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:12,450
hear everybody's opinion well when it's

00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:16,240
working there's a lot of opinions and

00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:18,070
it's just a huge amount of work to try

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,350
to Shepherd these discussions to you

00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:22,450
know distill down the details and I mean

00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:24,520
what's amazing to me is most of these

00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:26,770
threads all of these hundreds of

00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,810
comments they're actually most of them

00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:31,270
are saying interesting things it's not

00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,380
just you know people giving essentially

00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:35,410
thumbs up thumbs down I mean there's

00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:38,080
some of that but it's just a big

00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,280
scalability problem and I think the this

00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,010
is one of the things where we're

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,110
wrestling with the most right now and it

00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:47,410
shows up in a few different guises right

00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:48,910
so one of them is RFC threads and in

00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:52,210
fact there's been one of these runaway

00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:54,850
threads that I've had to step in on this

00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:57,340
week so this is definitely not a solved

00:41:54,850 --> 00:42:00,340
problem but there are other facets of

00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:02,920
scaling issues that we don't really have

00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,770
the answers for I think one thing that's

00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,690
been hard in rust for a long time is

00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:11,259
it's such a big project with so many

00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:14,169
different you know layers and aspects

00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:16,539
tools ecosystem and so on the amount

00:42:14,169 --> 00:42:18,849
that happens in any given week is more

00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:20,259
than anyone can keep up with and so we

00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:22,569
have layers and layers and layers of

00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:24,219
ways to help people keep up with this

00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:26,349
stuff right we have a weekly newsletter

00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:29,140
this weekend rust you know we have

00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:31,269
yearly roadmaps and six-month check-ins

00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,609
and biweekly newsletter you know you

00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:36,759
name it but it's like everything we try

00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:38,439
to do to cut through all of this noise

00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:40,479
and and sort of say okay here's the

00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:43,150
really most important thing actually

00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:46,329
ends up making more noise and so it can

00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:48,400
be really hard you know to make sure

00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:51,309
that people are hearing the things that

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,339
matter to them and we we've had some

00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:56,919
incidents recently where you know we had

00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:59,049
a feature that was multiple years in the

00:42:56,919 --> 00:43:00,279
making had gone through every phase of

00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:02,289
the processes we've been talking about

00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:04,630
advertised final comment periods and

00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:07,150
everything and then it shipped and then

00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:09,039
somebody said why wasn't I consulted at

00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,989
the very end of that and they actually

00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,509
wrote an RFC to try to unship the

00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:15,849
feature which you know we we shut down

00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:17,349
immediately and you know I think it was

00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:19,900
it was frustrating because we felt like

00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:21,579
okay we can't possibly be any more

00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,999
transparent about what we're doing like

00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:26,919
there's not the process itself you know

00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:29,529
is maxed out on that front so the

00:43:26,919 --> 00:43:32,169
problem is is somewhere else and and

00:43:29,529 --> 00:43:35,859
it's connected to clear communication

00:43:32,169 --> 00:43:37,659
and status tracking and I think a lot of

00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:40,239
this comes back to what Nico was talking

00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:41,919
about in the last section um you know

00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,269
when I look at the Russ project as a

00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:45,429
whole and I you know I'm trying to

00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:48,279
figure out what the biggest problems are

00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:50,999
that we need to tackle the thing I feel

00:43:48,279 --> 00:43:55,509
the most is the lack of managerial

00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:57,579
capacity and you know I think part of

00:43:55,509 --> 00:44:00,400
what makes this hard is to be an

00:43:57,579 --> 00:44:02,769
effective manager in this space you have

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,229
to be deeply technical you have to know

00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:06,309
your stuff but if you're so deeply

00:44:05,229 --> 00:44:08,979
technical and you're doing this as a

00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:10,599
volunteer you're probably going to have

00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,640
a lot better time like doing the

00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:15,279
technical work right there it takes a

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,099
special kind of persons who want to do

00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:20,079
this kind of coordination work and in

00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:21,459
their free time and they do exist we're

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,529
finding them and trying to figure out

00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:24,460
how to form them but well you know

00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:27,970
because of the

00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:31,450
this kind of contribution we have a hard

00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,680
time keeping things up to date clearly

00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:34,539
communicating you know cutting through

00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:38,980
all this noise and so we got have these

00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:42,369
scaling problems so there's kind of a

00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:45,660
ray of hope there's a this essay that I

00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:48,010
liked a lot by Michael Rogers about I

00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,380
you know comparing two different

00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,359
perspectives on open-source maintainer

00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,950
centric perspective and a community

00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:57,160
centric perspective and you can guess

00:44:53,950 --> 00:45:00,369
which one rust falls on but I think one

00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,650
of the insights in this article is about

00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:06,069
the problems of successful projects

00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:09,130
right so if your user base if your

00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:10,930
community is growing exponentially the

00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,819
only way to keep up with that is to grow

00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:15,010
the maintainer group exponentially and

00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:17,380
generally speaking the only effective

00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:19,559
way to do that is to turn that growing

00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,819
user and community base into the

00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:24,819
maintainer Xin to the leaders right so

00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:27,910
you have to sort of feed and make sure

00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:29,710
that the the you know the the growth

00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:32,619
that's causing the problem is also its

00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:35,349
own solution and that's why we put so

00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:37,240
much thought into these leadership

00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:38,230
pipelines and so on because it's our

00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,880
only hope

00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:43,119
there's no other way we could ever keep

00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,829
up with the amount of growth but as as

00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,589
Nico was saying this is the sketchiest

00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:49,809
part we you know we've added a lot of

00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:52,359
teams in in recent months and it's

00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:54,250
definitely helping but we're not all the

00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:56,020
way there yet so if you know certainly

00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:57,760
this is an area if any of you have

00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,359
experiences or insights about how to do

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:05,740
this we'd love to hear about it okay so

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:08,170
I won't spend a great deal more time so

00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,119
we tried to boil down you know these

00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,559
lessons into these succinct slogans that

00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:13,210
you can kind of keep in your head and

00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:15,880
you know we definitely use this this

00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:18,819
shorthand whenever we're talking about

00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,589
some new things we raised like the wwic

00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:22,299
you know have we made sure that there's

00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:26,309
enough consultation before we go forward

00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:29,950
with this and I guess the the last note

00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:32,829
I'll leave this talk on is the unifying

00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:34,119
thread for all all of these lessons that

00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:37,820
I think are approaches to the rest

00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:39,710
community in general which is that

00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:43,610
what leadership needs most is humility

00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:47,090
and that's really how the RUS community

00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:49,190
is structured that we recognize the fact

00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:51,020
that clear leadership is important like

00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:52,910
there is a role for distinguished

00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,540
leaders but that the leaders don't have

00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,120
all the answers

00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:59,420
and that their most important job is

00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:01,310
listening and all of these processes and

00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:04,430
mechanisms are designed to facilitate

00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:07,700
that but at the end of the day what it

00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:10,310
really boils down to is that you know we

00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:12,260
think people are valuable and we think

00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:14,690
they have ideas that that we don't so we

00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:17,030
want to hear from them I just want to

00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:19,610
add one last note which is to think Dave

00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:21,830
Herman and Yehuda Katz whose insights

00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:28,380
and love of acronyms have given rise to

00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:31,729
a lot of these things thank you

00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,729
[Applause]

00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:42,539
I don't know I guess we have time for

00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:46,140
some questions or overtime so I don't

00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:51,630
know who's running the session it's one

00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:55,740
host who's giving the next talk come on

00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:57,240
up yeah I think we're oh there is an

00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:02,480
intimate oh well then we do have time

00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,480
for questions if there are no yes

00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:34,130
look the question was just for the for

00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:36,020
the Mike I guess whether sometimes there

00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:37,490
may be value in making a decision even

00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,960
if the best decision is an apparent

00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:41,180
basically if the difference between them

00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,750
is not big enough it's good to just move

00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:46,040
forward and I guess I don't think I

00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:51,680
thought a lot about it but I feel like

00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:54,380
our our look but that they or the way

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,000
the reason having the teams make a final

00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,520
decision like basically the rules that

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,070
we usually use to to tell when it's time

00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:03,500
to move forward is when you can lay out

00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:05,960
the arguments on each side and kind of

00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,030
unbalance make a call in some way and I

00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,890
think it it doesn't have to be that

00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:12,740
there is a clear answer basically it's

00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:15,080
okay to say both of these seemed pretty

00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,390
reasonable but you know we decided to go

00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,100
this way it usually it's good if you can

00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:20,540
justify it a little better than that but

00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,980
if it's at the end it's you know if you

00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,940
if the reason is you think it's hard to

00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,580
tell and you're going to try it

00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:27,500
that seems okay to me by the way if you

00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:30,500
can make a persuasive case but I would

00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,700
say we I wouldn't say we rejected I

00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,130
would say it's a little harder in this

00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,550
system to do that especially not

00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,550
preemptively

00:49:56,810 --> 00:50:04,740
yeah so I guess I have a slightly

00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:06,420
different perspective I think there are

00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,160
two so I think this is a really

00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,380
important question and the tension

00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,869
between this drawn-out decision-making

00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,430
process and a need to ship is one of the

00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:19,320
hardest things that rests leadership

00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:22,560
faces I think there are two things that

00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:25,070
help mitigate this one the community is

00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:28,140
actually pretty good at recognizing

00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:30,840
cases that don't matter that much I mean

00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,670
even there may be like very heated

00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,740
debate going on or whatever about some

00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,420
particular syntactic choice but

00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,820
especially if there's no clear consensus

00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,960
emerging they're pretty okay with the

00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,940
team just sort of stepping in and saying

00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,220
okay we just need to make a decision and

00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,830
we're gonna go this way but I think the

00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:50,670
bigger thing is the roadmap process

00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:52,140
because we can set expectations that the

00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:54,980
roadmap is where we really think as a

00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:57,480
community about rust the product and

00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,280
what needs to happen with that as a

00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,530
product and that includes timelines for

00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,750
shipping and so on and so we can set

00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:05,670
expectations about we need to have

00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:08,849
reached a decision by such-and-such time

00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:10,710
in the year and it's it's delicate like

00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:12,540
if you try to force it and there's not

00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:15,380
enough buy-in that you can get into big

00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:18,450
trouble but I definitely don't think

00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:19,710
debates should just be open forever as a

00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,480
matter of course I hate something really

00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,710
important that you can show there's one

00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,750
other thing I want to add I think that's

00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:27,170
really very true Aaron just said that

00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:30,960
like in sense you're making a value of

00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:32,520
of shipping right and pushing on it and

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,080
saying sometimes that has value in and

00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,339
of itself but there's one other thing I

00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,570
think is key that we didn't actually

00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:38,099
talk a lot about but I think it's

00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:41,430
important in our process which is that

00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:42,630
it doesn't end with an RFC and usually

00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,320
when at least in our system when you

00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,330
land the RFC

00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,339
that's like the authorization to begin

00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:48,900
the work in some sense but there are

00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:50,940
decisions along the way and they they

00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,099
have their own process which is similar

00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:54,900
and there's a Lionel Stabilization

00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:56,400
decision at the end so a lot of times I

00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,690
think there are decisions where

00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,790
you know what it's okay to defer that

00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:02,490
right now until you have more experience

00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:05,160
and so on and that it addresses some of

00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:07,620
these cases at least and you reach a

00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,280
final decision later and that's that's

00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,280
good actually

00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:32,130
yeah so there's not there's not like a

00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:33,630
black-and-white formula for sure oh sure

00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:35,789
repeat the question yeah so that the

00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:38,039
question is basically are there any sort

00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:40,769
of formal timelines around the various

00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:43,410
parts of the RFC process and the answer

00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:45,209
is basically no so the final comment

00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,759
period itself that is a fixed length of

00:52:45,209 --> 00:52:52,410
time it's ten days and there are various

00:52:47,759 --> 00:52:53,959
reasons for that but you know this is to

00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:57,420
some degree an unsolved problem where

00:52:53,959 --> 00:52:59,789
people will write excellent rfcs that

00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:01,890
are like looking way into the future and

00:52:59,789 --> 00:53:04,469
I think everybody including the authors

00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:07,739
realizes that this RFC is not an

00:53:04,469 --> 00:53:09,089
appropriate thing to accept now and then

00:53:07,739 --> 00:53:11,839
the question is well is it okay for

00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:14,939
people to talk about it or is that a

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:18,119
distraction and we we go back and forth

00:53:14,939 --> 00:53:19,680
about this so I think that one of the

00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:21,660
ideas we have about trying to improve

00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,269
the scaling issues and so on is to

00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,739
basically narrow the scope of rfcs or

00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:28,229
have a more clear delineation of like

00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:30,449
these are just discussions and these are

00:53:28,229 --> 00:53:32,369
like actually in the RFC pipeline and

00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:35,489
there's sort of a gate to step into that

00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:36,959
so the actual process just to answer

00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:40,319
that I think you asked what it was is

00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:42,599
that we have someone proposes the

00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,759
especial comment that we accept or

00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,109
reject and they give a summary of the

00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:47,910
discussions and the key points and

00:53:46,109 --> 00:53:49,170
arguments for either side and then

00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,420
there's a checklist or the members of

00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:53,039
the team and when enough of them I think

00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,170
it's all but three or something have

00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:56,609
checked off that they agree then we move

00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,869
to the final comment period and at any

00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,459
point anyone on the team can raise a

00:53:57,869 --> 00:54:00,959
blocking objection at which point we

00:53:59,459 --> 00:54:02,729
can't move forward until that blocking

00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:04,819
objection is resolved in one way or

00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:04,819
another

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,750
so the question is have we thought about

00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:27,500
alternatives to github issues and PRS

00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:29,299
and the answer is endlessly I also find

00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,859
them very dissatisfying but it's we

00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:33,289
haven't yet found an alternative that we

00:54:30,859 --> 00:54:34,750
find like unbalanced better but I think

00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:37,059
there's definitely room for improvement

00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:39,829
especially shifting away from

00:54:37,059 --> 00:54:41,650
encouraging lots of small very fast

00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:45,049
back-and-forth comments and towards a

00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:47,210
sort of more deliberative style so we've

00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:48,890
experimented in not four RFC's but like

00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,690
for the roadmap process with people

00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,130
submitting blog posts for example about

00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,390
what they think the priorities for the

00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:55,430
year should be and then we read all the

00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:57,859
blog posts and this this encouraged a

00:54:55,430 --> 00:55:01,250
different style of authorship right

00:54:57,859 --> 00:55:03,710
there were a hundred blog posts so it

00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:07,000
took a while to read them I was Aaron's

00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:07,000
job yeah it's great

00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:31,930
so the the question was basically this

00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,430
seems great for rust how adaptable is it

00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:36,730
to other kinds of projects bigger or

00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:38,530
smaller and I I don't think we thought

00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:42,760
to too deeply about this to be honest

00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:46,450
we're very focused but I think you know

00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:49,270
certainly the level of bureaucracy that

00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:52,510
we have now is not appropriate for early

00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:54,430
stage but the core themes that we tried

00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:56,200
to pull out in this talk of why wasn't I

00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:59,080
consulted articulate the vision path to

00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:01,390
leadership that's the real part of this

00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,250
and I think those ideas apply to any

00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:06,010
scale of project and there are lots of

00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:08,470
ways you can codify them into processes

00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:11,440
so one place you can see this happening

00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:14,200
actually is in rust libraries in the

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,670
open source ecosystem you know they're

00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,220
part of the russ community they're often

00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:20,800
trying to mimic rust processes to some

00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:23,590
degree so many of them have some kind of

00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,990
RFC like process but it's really boiled

00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:27,430
down you know it's much simpler but

00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,320
they're still just a very clear oh

00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:31,510
here's a big decision that's coming

00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,520
we're gonna flag this communicate it out

00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:35,980
and give people you know a clear place

00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:39,480
to comment on it so I think like the

00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:39,480
core ideas are very reusable

00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,229
[Music]

00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:23,950
yeah I think we probably have to call it

00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:27,000
although do want to take one more yeah

00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,000
let's take it final right Emily

00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,780
[Music]

00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,640
so the question was about the path out

00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,350
of leadership as well and I that has

00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,380
been on our minds lately and you had a

00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:03,060
great post about it uh but I we've

00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,320
definitely had people transition out and

00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:07,050
the usual what I tell people when

00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:09,210
they're coming in is basically I would

00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:11,820
like you to join the team you can at any

00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:13,410
point say I need a break and you'll go

00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:14,790
to alumni status and you're on alumni

00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,990
status until you choose to come back and

00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:18,390
it's kind of up to you right but and

00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:20,100
that's a very simple that's like the the

00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:23,280
first cut but I think we can do a lot

00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,660
