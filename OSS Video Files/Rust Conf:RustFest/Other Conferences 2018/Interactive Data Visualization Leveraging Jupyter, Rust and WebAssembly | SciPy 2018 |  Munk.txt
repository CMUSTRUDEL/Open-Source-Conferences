Title: Interactive Data Visualization Leveraging Jupyter, Rust and WebAssembly | SciPy 2018 |  Munk
Publication date: 2018-09-09
Playlist: Other Conferences 2018
Description: 
	This talk covers a Jupyter widget built using Rust and WebAssembly for interactive, browser-based visualization of datasets with yt, a python package used to analyze and visualize volumetric data in a number of scientific domains. Users can interact and explore datasets of varying sizes with our Jupyter widget. We minimize latency that results from data transmission between yt and the browser by compiling our pixelization routines to WebAssembly and pushing data to the browser. Operations on the canvas are subsequently done in the browser. Our tool enables interactive data exploration accessible to a broad user base.
