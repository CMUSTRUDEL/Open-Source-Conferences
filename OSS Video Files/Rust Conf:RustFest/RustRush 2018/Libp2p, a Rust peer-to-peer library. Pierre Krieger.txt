Description: 
	Pierre is a Rust programmer at Parity. He previously worked on graphics programming, including several Rust crates for Vulkan and OpenGL. He is now working on peer-to-peer networking.

The Rust libp2p library is the Rust implementation of the libp2p protocol initially created by Protocol Labs. Based on futures and tokio, it allows one to easily create a decentralized peer-to-peer network. This talk will introduce you to the main concepts of a peer-to-peer network, and how to use libp2p.
