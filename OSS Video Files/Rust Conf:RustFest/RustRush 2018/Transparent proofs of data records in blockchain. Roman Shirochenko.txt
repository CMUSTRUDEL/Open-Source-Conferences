Publication date: 2019-02-06
Playlist: RustRush 2018
Description: 
	Roman is a Rust programmer at Bitfury, he leads the Exonum Russia team. They develop blockchain applications built on the Exonum. He has experience in building and integration of enterprise and government blockchain solutions.

Exonum is a blockchain framework developed in Rust that allows building secure permissioned blockchain applications. Blockchain, as a technology that expands the capabilities of distributed databases, implies the possibility of auditing or validating stored information.
Exonum provides a “proofs mechanism”, based on cryptographic commitments via Merkle / Merkle Patricia trees. This mechanism allows verifying that a response from the full node has been really authorized by a supermajority of validators.
The talk will present how we develop the merkelized collections in Exonum and the tools to provide data auditability functionality for the web applications integration. The talk will be based on the auction blockchain application example.
