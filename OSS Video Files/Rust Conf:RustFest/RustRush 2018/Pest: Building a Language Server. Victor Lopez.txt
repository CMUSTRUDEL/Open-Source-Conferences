Description: 
	Victor is a Brazilian ERP developer who currently works in Russia for the localization of a product. In his free time, he's a Rust enthusiast who aims to bring more companies to its benefits.

To build a language server, we need a very robust parser and some efficient JSON/RPC framework.
To achieve that, I used Pest (PEG-based) with a big TDD coverage for the parser, and Parity’s solution for the JSON/RPC interface.
Currently, I’m on beta; I expect to achieve a base of 10k users.
