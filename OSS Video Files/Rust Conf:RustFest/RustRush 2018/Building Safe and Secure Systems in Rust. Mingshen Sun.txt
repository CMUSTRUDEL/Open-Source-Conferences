Description: 
	Mingshen Sun is a senior security researcher of Baidu X-Lab at Baidu USA. He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. His interests lie in solving real-world security problems related to system, mobile, IoT devices and cars. He maintains and actively contributes to several open source projects in Rust such as the MesaLock Linux project, MesaPy, and YogCrypt.

Rust is designed to be a system programming language which is fast and guarantees memory safety. However, building safe and secure systems is not simply using Rust to rewrite existing code. Still, there are many challenges such as the Rust language, unsafe Rust, foreign function interface (FFI), and designing systems with a hybrid memory model. In this talk, we will discuss some challenges in the view of security. We will demonstrate the challenges and lesson learned by using some real-world case studies. Finally, we will raise some open questions, initial ideas, and possible solutions.
