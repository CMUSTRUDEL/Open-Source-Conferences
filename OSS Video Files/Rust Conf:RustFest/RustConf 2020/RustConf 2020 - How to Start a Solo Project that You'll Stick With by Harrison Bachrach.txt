	How to Start a Solo Project that You'll Stick With by Harrison Bachrach

Have you ever started a solo project that never really came together? Been able to write something up in a weekend but dropped it soon after? Me too! In this talk I go over how I was able to break from that and build my first CLI tool, written in Rust. Drawing from an understanding of habit formation, weâ€™ll examine how to plan projects in a way that keeps you fulfilled and stops you from veering off track.

hi

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
i'm harrison backrack i typically say

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,960
i'm a software engineer during

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,480
introductions but

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,160
chances are high that you're a software

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,960
engineer too so

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,840
i guess i bake uh but i guess everyone

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,119
is baking right now

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,960
so to clarify it i bake holla here's

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,079
some holla before it's edible and

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,360
here's some holla while it's edible if

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,960
you haven't heard of holla

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,800
that's it's like that scene at the end

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,480
of tangled where all the kids get

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
together and braid rapunzel's hair so

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,160
it's not dragging everywhere

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,039
but unlike hair it's not gluten-free

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,760
i actually had a frame from tangled in

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,199
here but

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
i was worried about the stream being

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,320
taken down so that's why you have some

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,160
generic stock footage

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,840
so if you're like me you've probably

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,199
gotten really passionate about

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,439
programming at some point

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,479
for some reason and wanted to do a side

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,799
project

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,680
cool me too it happens to me all the

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,280
time

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,880
and things always kind of fall apart

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,439
right

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,400
first you have an idea a lot of us are

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,520
spending a lot of time

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,600
indoors all of a sudden so what if you

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,759
were to start an indoor plant collection

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,799
except if you're like me you forget to

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,640
water these things or

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,400
forget which plant needs what sort of

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,360
light and all of a sudden you go from

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
this

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,400
to this don't think anyone needs this

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,680
kind of vibe in their home right now

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,560
so can software help uh i mean

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
let's be real probably not software can

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,399
be pretty bad

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,640
but hey maybe you know i've been looking

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,720
to make something in my spare time

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,640
i'm primarily a front-end developer but

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,360
i've been hearing about rust web server

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
projects like

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,920
actics and rocket maybe i can make a web

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,240
app or something

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,079
yeah yeah you'll be able to upload

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,880
pictures of your plants over time

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,280
you'll be able to give them names you'll

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,479
tell

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,320
it'll tell you when they need to be

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,640
watered which soil type

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,840
they need and where to find that soil

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,080
tons of features

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,360
great so you get started and work on it

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,560
until three am and

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,640
you get it to the point where you can

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,520
create a plants and you deploy it to

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,280
heroku

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,920
and the automated tests run on push and

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,080
some time passes and now that thing that

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,879
was so much fun for an evening is a stub

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,400
of a program

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,400
and you've lost all interest or

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,160
enthusiasm

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,319
so i feel like this is probably a

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,200
familiar experience for a lot of you

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,680
it's a very familiar experience for me

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,360
so

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,959
what happened we're gonna come back to

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,560
that at the end of this talk but

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,879
first let's talk a little bit about rust

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
i forget how i found out about rust but

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,519
i was intrigued as soon as i got the

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,519
pitch

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,560
i really like powerful static type

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,040
systems which is

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,040
funny because all of the languages i use

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,560
daily are dynamically typed

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,640
though maybe i've just been burned too

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,440
many times by my own silly mistakes

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,159
who knows so i'd read the rust book a

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,879
few times

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,080
before off and on but i'd never really

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,280
made anything with it

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,959
partly because i didn't know how to

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,000
start and partly because i was

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,920
intimidated

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
but eventually i saw how easy it was to

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,040
make command line applications

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,280
and that got me working my first rust

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,959
program root

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,879
side note thanks to all the people who

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,959
made this section of the site about

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,239
what to make with rust i went to the

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,400
homepage for the first time

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,200
for the first time about a year after

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,120
initially being introduced to rust

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,120
not knowing what to actually build and i

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,200
found this information super useful

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,200
getting up and running on my first

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,680
project

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,280
right so this is about solo projects so

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,120
let's talk about the solo project of

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,920
mine that actually worked

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,599
root or if you want to call it rut is a

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,120
pretty straightforward program

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,000
think of it like tree but instead of

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,720
directories and files it works on data

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,519
for example you can input some json that

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,360
you might

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,959
be using to represent a tree of some

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,959
sort

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,760
here we have a root node with the name

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,640
cool a single child node with the name

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,760
beans and a single grandchild node with

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,560
the name man

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,720
but that's kind of hard to see so root

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,000
takes that json and converts it

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,840
into a diagram like this cool beans

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,680
man the reason i'm talking about root

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,280
is that it took almost two months to get

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
it into its current state

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,120
if you're thinking that's a long time to

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,080
make a program to do that

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,000
i think you're right i'm very much a

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,840
beginner when it comes to rust and it's

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
very possible that many of you could get

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,919
this done in a single evening

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,440
now i've done small one-night projects

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,160
before i made

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,440
a widget for making digital flowers to

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,199
send to people

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,120
i made a dumb two-headed version of

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,280
snake with terrible controls

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,720
and both were fun they fall into the

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,639
same issues that come with their

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,600
gardening app from earlier

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,160
i never came back to them so after

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,479
working

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,440
on root for weeks and weeks i started

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,560
asking myself

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,560
why did this project turn out

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,520
differently what was different

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,199
well it became a habit for a lot of us

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,960
side projects are something that we

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,560
want to do in the abstract but have

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,080
trouble doing in the moment

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,320
if you've ever come up with new year's

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,400
resolutions and almost inevitably

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,320
failed those resolutions that concept

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,240
might be familiar to you

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,680
and that's probably most of you assuming

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,199
you had any

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,320
so what goes into a successful habit

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,960
firstly you have to do it of course

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,160
that's

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,160
a lot easier said than done

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,160
now we're about to step into a big vat

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
of psychology research and i want to

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,639
give a huge disclaimer that i'm a

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
software engineer

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,759
not a psychologist or a mental health

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,080
professional i'm

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,680
also not a doctor nor lawyer and it's

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,680
kind of a bummer because

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,759
both of those careers are much easier to

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,479
explain to your parents

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,280
so in prepping for this talk i read this

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,080
paper called

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,720
promoting habit formation and in it i

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,680
found this

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,000
super academic sounding quote intentions

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,520
to act are significant precursors of

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,800
initiation of behavior

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,120
but intention translation is imperfect

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,880
what the heck does that mean well just

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,160
because you want to do something

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,720
and you know that that thing that

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,600
and you know that you want that thing to

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,039
be done

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,759
doesn't mean that you'll actually do it

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,120
when the opportunity arrives

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
there are a lot of reasons why people

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,039
abandon projects but a major one is not

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,520
feeling satisfied

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,919
now this may seem silly to say out loud

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,720
but how satisfied you feel by working on

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,960
a project

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,080
is a big factor in whether or not you'll

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,479
stick with it

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,080
if building a project building your

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,600
project isn't satisfying

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,680
you might want to reflect on that for a

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,800
bit why did you think it would be

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,440
satisfying

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
if it was satisfying before what changed

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,160
not every minute is going to be super

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,560
fun of course

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,560
but if it feels really dull for a while

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,560
it may make sense to step back and

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240
consider how to address that or how to

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,319
move on to something that might be more

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,319
satisfying for you

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,080
one thing to note here is that you can

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,599
encourage your satisfaction

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,599
you may not think about how much you

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,160
improve on a skill while working on a

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,759
project

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,680
but that reflection can be super

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,759
uplifting and help you see value in the

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,080
work that you've already done

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,599
now it all starts with a good goal what

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,759
do you want to do

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,000
you'll often come up with a simple goal

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,840
at first when starting a new project

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,039
you might write it down or just have it

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,599
in your head

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,720
but the work between you and your goal

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,919
may grow

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,160
this is often how things get

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,120
unsatisfying no longer feels like the

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,960
work that you're doing is

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,800
actually progressing you towards that

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,599
goal which is the thing that got you

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
into this

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,199
into the first place coming up with

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,720
unrealistic goals is

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,879
really easy for example aiming to catch

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,639
all pokemon is a ludicrous goal to start

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,000
out with

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:58,400
now i feel bad for making fun of a child

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
but ash ketchum is an absolute fool

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,759
do you know how many kinds of pokemon

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,759
there are almost 900

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,160
so let's say we have some realistic goal

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,960
how do we make sure we actually do the

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,199
work

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,879
one common idea in habit formation is

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,400
something called automaticity

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,319
which is basically the act of doing

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,080
something automatically without

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,520
meaning to do it or even being aware of

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,520
it for example

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,879
for some of you flossing your teeth is

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,960
often an automatic

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,319
action that you don't actively plan out

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,160
or think about

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,840
now you probably can't write code as

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,479
unconsciously as you can floss your

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,039
teeth

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
but you can start that way that is you

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,959
can't write a test without thinking

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,399
about it

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,839
but you can sit down in front of your

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,640
computer and open up your editor pretty

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,800
automatically

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,880
so when should you work on your project

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,480
it's very common to pick a fixed time to

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,399
start working on something

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,839
for example i will go to the computer at

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,440
7 pm

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,040
but fixed times aren't really how we

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,200
structure a lot of our day

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,120
instead our day is broken up by events

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,279
into periods of activity

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,959
you take a shower you clean up the table

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,480
you finish eating dinner

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,080
the gaps between these periods are

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,440
really significant and tend to stick to

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,959
your mind much better

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
these are the times to schedule working

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,200
on your project

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,519
but when those events happen what do you

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,399
do even when you remember to work on a

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,720
project

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,200
starting can be daunting in order to

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
make a habit having a plan helps a lot

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,959
the research is pretty clear here

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
there's one type of plan that's

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,279
super helpful called implementation

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,120
intentions however that name is a pain

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,640
to say so i'm just going to call them if

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,120
then plans they have a form like this

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,000
if i encounter x then i will do y in

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,360
order to reach goal

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,640
z let's say you want to start a habit of

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,519
drinking more water

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,800
an if then plan that might help is if i

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,640
get out of bed in the morning

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,000
then i will fill my water bottle and put

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,760
it on my desk

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
the idea is to get simple tasks into

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,519
your routine so that the harder tasks

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,440
like remembering to drink throughout the

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,959
day get easier

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
for software projects getting your

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,720
environment set up like opening up your

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,519
editor and project tracker can make

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,360
starting work a lot less scary

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,959
now in working on your habit there are

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
likely going to be some struggles

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,240
whether it's difficulty in building the

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,160
habit in the first place

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
frustration when writing code or

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,079
uncertainty not on how to make important

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,600
architectural decisions

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,360
you could create what are called coping

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,720
plans on how to deal with these issues

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
when they crop up

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
research has found that coping plans

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,560
when applied to

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,800
physical exercise had a dramatic effect

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,959
on the endurance of those habits

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,399
of those in the study that made specific

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,800
plans on

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,600
when where and how to exercise two

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,160
months later

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,760
around 44 were still performing at least

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,920
an hour and a half of exercise

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,120
per week however for those who had made

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,040
coping plans

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,560
71 percent were still working out that

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,480
much

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,320
forming concrete plans on how to deal

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,279
with these roadblocks is super valuable

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,600
for success

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,040
but also for mental health there very

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,120
well may be times when

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,880
working on your project where you feel

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,880
really useless or stupid

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,240
but these are neither accurate nor

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,000
helpful thoughts

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,399
programming can be a really demoralizing

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
hobby imposter syndrome is rife within

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,680
our industry and those feelings are

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,600
often compounded for underrepresented

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,440
engineers

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
i wasn't able to find much research on

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,680
coping plans that might apply to side

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,079
projects

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,839
but in my experience these were super

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,240
helpful

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,640
first talk with people talking with

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,320
people engineers and non-engineers alike

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,240
can be a huge relief and put things in

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
perspective and of course it's

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,000
fun i think we could all use a little

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,399
bit of fun right now

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
secondly find some nice communities

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,640
online

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,800
in addition to being a great place to

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,320
ask questions people working on similar

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,959
things can often understand your

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,480
frustrations in a deeply validating way

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,079
i've had a bunch of super great

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,279
interactions on the rus discord for

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,880
example

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,040
that said there are a lot of not nice

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,800
communities online i remember i asked a

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,519
question on tree traversal on stack

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,440
overflow

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,600
and the first comment was stop doing

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,200
this and rest

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,040
number three just step away from the

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,880
computer oftentimes

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,320
all you need is a bit of distance from

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,000
what you're working on to help clear

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,680
your mind and relax you

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,600
not only that but i found that most of

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,079
the time i figure out a tricky problem

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
when i'm

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,880
washing dishes or about to fall asleep

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,480
now with all these suggestions there's

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,480
one thing that i'll advise against

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,680
and that is setting external rewards for

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,839
yourself

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,560
say for a little extra dessert if you

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,120
work a bit a little bit longer

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,519
these have actually been shown to reduce

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,760
intrinsic motivation

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,639
the risk is that the rewards can often

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,600
become the goal

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,920
in and of themselves or that the rewards

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,800
mean

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,240
less and less over time the cool the

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,000
rewards also tend to have

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
less of an effect if you have very high

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,519
awareness of them and we're talking

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,079
about solo projects here so that seems

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,480
very likely

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,480
now there's a very common acronym smart

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,079
that is referenced a lot in articles on

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,160
successful habit building and goal

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,440
setting it was initially introduced by

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,480
this guy named george t

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,800
doran a consultant and director at the

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,720
washington water power company in an

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,720
article intended for managers on

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,000
how to set corporate objectives but

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,519
since its introduction

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,279
the ideas have gone through a few

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,040
changes that better align with personal

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,720
goal setting for individuals

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,240
while they weren't derived from academic

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
research they are still a

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,000
very useful tool that align with many of

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,760
the conclusions from various studies on

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,040
habit formation

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,000
anyway what are smart goals a smart goal

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,200
is specific

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,120
it's very clear what the problem is and

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,320
if that if your project is intended to

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,000
solve a problem

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,079
it's very clear what needs to get done

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,399
or what you need to build

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,920
a smart goal is measurable meaning it

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,959
should be clear what's required for it

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,440
to be workable

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,880
or how close it is to becoming workable

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,600
notice i didn't say done

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,600
more on that later

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,279
a smart goal is achievable it's

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,560
something that isn't too far outside the

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,560
realm of possibility

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,839
i'd love to build a laptop from scratch

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,800
for example but for me

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,399
that's not exactly realistic a smart

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,839
goal is relevant to you

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,839
it needs to be something that you care

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,839
about something that motivates you

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,760
it's something that's hard it's really

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,560
hard to put a lot of time into something

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,120
that is not directly meaningful to you

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,240
lastly

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,800
a smart goal is time bound now in most

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,839
indications of smart this refers to a

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,760
sort of due date

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,639
but that often doesn't apply to side

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,800
projects it may never be truly done

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
additionally due dates often create

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,760
unnecessary stress

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,519
and this is something that should be

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,040
enjoyable instead

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,720
i'd like to think as time-bound as

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,720
referring to your engagement with the

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,639
project on a day-to-day level

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,560
limit your habitual time instead of your

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,240
total time

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,160
so let's see how smart connects to root

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,839
first the initial goal was just to write

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,160
a program that made drawing those

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,120
those tree diagrams from an easy to type

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,720
input

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,480
the project expanded beyond that

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,040
afterwards of course but the initial

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,720
idea was very focused

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,800
as i went through adding features to

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,199
root i really only thought about

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,959
everything one small step at a time this

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,800
meant that as i wrote more code

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,720
the proctors felt really real and was

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,360
directly measurable i could literally

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,519
count the number of things that i had

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,360
added

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,120
so this sort of measurement elegantly

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,959
translates to filing issues

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,320
creating tickets or however you like to

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,320
do task tracking

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,079
this can be as simple as a list of a

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,160
piece of paper which is what i used

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,160
or it can be as sophisticated as an

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,040
integration with like github issues

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,040
or a clubhouse project another natural

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,880
way to measure progress is with semantic

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,320
versioning or whatever versioning scheme

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,480
you might like to use

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,720
each release is a concrete indication of

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,279
progress whether it is a feature edition

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,480
a bug fix or something else entirely

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,920
both ticket tracking

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,680
and semantic versioning serve as

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,839
reminders to recognize achievements

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,040
that you made along the way which is

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,360
very easy to forget

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,399
especially when the intermediate product

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,519
of your project

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,800
doesn't feel very impressive when i

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,880
started planning root

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,480
i kept scopes small i wasn't going to

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,240
have any command line options

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,720
i would it would do one thing and only

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,639
one thing and even that was too hard

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,480
starting in rust was so difficult that i

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,959
had to make an initial prototype in ruby

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,600
my primary language

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,759
root as a project felt very useful to me

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,839
it came out of the very real issue that

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,079
communicating the specifics of tree data

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,320
structures is super hard

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,160
i deal with trees a lot at work and

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,320
talking about various corner cases

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,759
with specific tree structures was always

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,000
super challenging

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,680
in addition to the problem domain root

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
gave me the opportunity to learn about

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,600
parsers as well as rust both of which i

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,120
had been partially exposed to

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,839
but hadn't really been able to sink my

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,680
teeth into that prototype from earlier

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,600
also aided the motivation on continuing

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,360
with rust as it showed that switching to

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,160
rust dropped the execution time

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,920
from 200 milliseconds to 5 milliseconds

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,440
the static type system also caught a

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,160
number of bugs that would have been a

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,759
real pain

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,279
later on so when working on route

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,720
i would really only spend a few hours a

00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,440
night and only two to three nights a

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,120
week

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,959
when i got stuck or frustrated on a

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,799
problem i would give it a solid attempt

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,959
but if that wasn't enough i would take a

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,559
break or stop on it for the day

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,319
typically i would continue thinking

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,880
about the problem in the back of my mind

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,640
and

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,079
when i came back to it my frustration

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,520
was replaced with excitement

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,559
and i would end up solving it very

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,160
quickly most of the time anyway

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,079
in addition to the smart attributes i

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,319
just mentioned i found a few other

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,919
things really really helpful

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,679
showing what i was working on to other

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,440
people was very encouraging

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,720
even when they're even when they weren't

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,559
super impressed

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,240
it still made what i had made more real

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,240
to me

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,840
celebrating victories also made the work

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,400
more fun for example

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,720
i track downloads on crates io and i

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
still very vividly remember passing 50

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,679
downloads and

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,919
being wowed that anyone else might find

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,080
what i made useful

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,919
so we're equipped to look at what

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,440
happened earlier now with our gardening

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,760
project

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,799
firstly the scope of the project just

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,240
ballooned

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,880
what started as a way to track caring

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,200
for plants became something much bigger

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,720
learning rust is also a big challenge

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,919
and creating a web application is no

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,520
small feat

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,200
in addition to learning rust we also

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,840
needed to create an authentication

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,400
system

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,280
we needed to set up how to handle assets

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,440
we needed to

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,960
to deploy to some server all of that

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,480
takes time before we can get up and

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,320
running

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,840
working for all those hours sure was fun

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,440
but it's not sustainable

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,440
you end up exhausted the next day and

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,960
associating all of that exhaustion with

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,559
all the work that kept you up also one

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,440
thing missing from the story is anyone

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,520
else

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
no talking with friends to bounce ideas

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,559
off of no chatting online when running

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,400
into roadblocks

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,039
working alone is certainly possible but

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,039
it's a tough path to follow

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,480
all of this is well and good but i do

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,039
need to point out a bunch of things

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,000
because

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,600
well i don't want people to yell at me i

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,559
fear being yelled at so much i even

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,400
named my

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,440
now abandoned ultra depressing comic

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,200
series please stop yelling online

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,640
really anyway

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,200
asterisks firstly don't feel like

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,799
watching

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,720
after watching this talk that you ought

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,720
to do as programming side project

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,760
it's not for everyone it's not even for

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,240
me a lot of the time

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,840
that's okay you can have other hobbies i

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,120
imagine a good deal of you write

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,480
software for your job

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,120
if you don't want to bring that home

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,320
then don't another thing

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,160
right now we're living through a

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,320
historic global pandemic that has

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,080
dramatically impacted most of our lives

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,919
not only that but people are becoming

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,840
even more aware the very

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,679
present problem of police brutality

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,600
against black people in america

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,760
as a result you might feel demotivated

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,280
to work on a side project right now

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,799
even if you have tons and tons of free

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,679
time that's okay

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,960
side projects are optional also you

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,039
might follow this advice

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,600
start a project and abandon it that's

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,919
okay this stuff isn't a silver bullet

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
no study about any of this stuff has 100

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,039
written anywhere

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,120
that doesn't say anything about you

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,760
stuff happens

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,960
lastly again please don't yell at me i'm

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,400
very weak and i will be

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,720
super sad so in conclusion

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,400
make a plan not a schedule build

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,240
something that you care about

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,480
think small and be kind to yourself

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,520
i want to thank everyone uh that was

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,200
involved in

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,679
uh setting up ruskoff i also want to

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,400
thank my parents as well as my partner

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,559
ann marie

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,240
everyone has been super helpful in

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,400
getting this talk to this stage

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,720
um if you want to follow me online my

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,000
website is holoscript.com that's for the

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,039
ch

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,120
