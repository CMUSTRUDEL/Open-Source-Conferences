	Macros for a More Productive Rust by jam1garner

The macro system in Rust is still arguably in its infancy. While a lot of the implementation has already been done, plenty of projects don't properly take advantage of macros due to the limited resources on what macro programming should look like. This talk is aimed at introducing those interested in using macros in existing or future projects to macro idioms often needed in order to take projects to the next level.
