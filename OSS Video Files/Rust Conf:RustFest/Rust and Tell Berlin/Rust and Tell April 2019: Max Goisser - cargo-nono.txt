okay hi-yah today I'm going to tell you

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,080
a bit about noisy and how corny cargo no

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,560
no can hopefully avoid some of your

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,590
troubles

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:31,040
who here has like a rough idea what no

00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:35,600
STD stands for what's good huh yeah

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:38,050
for those who don't I'm going to go a

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,989
pigeon - what is this know anything and

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,809
why should I care because I mean for

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:47,629
some of you it's very not that close

00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:51,800
let's see yeah that's some basics like

00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:53,960
this hash-bang rapid fracture it's

00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,230
generally quite wide attribute you put

00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,609
it top of the entry file like manor has

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:06,560
numerous and then it applies to apply

00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:09,230
some attributes to your crate and what

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:15,110
it is it is essentially just rust with

00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:17,480
no mercy no standard library and what is

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,650
in the standard library like a lot of

00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,630
Thai stuff the connections iOS something

00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,690
you usually always want to have in your

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:30,050
environment so why would I not want to

00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:33,530
use you know why would a you not want to

00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:35,870
use a city because sometimes your tiger

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,910
platform doesn't let you and a lot of

00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,400
that along those times it's in

00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:43,540
restricted environments usually embedded

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,610
with microphone servers etc there

00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,770
because it s in the Sun I will usually

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,170
have also the assumption that it can

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,540
allocate stuff you have some operating

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:59,150
system running and knowing the

00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:01,400
environments you sometimes don't and one

00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:05,090
of those other platforms is to some

00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,550
degree I know that it's a fight but I

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,560
also want to don't what you go too deep

00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,560
into it because I think it might confuse

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,930
you with today to talk and some other or

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,060
more exotic pockets for example when I

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,580
was

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,030
first like really touching on nosey

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,010
stuff I was working on he was um

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,350
for those of you who know apparently

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:30,290
they're working a few times a day at by

00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,350
a pleasant face runtime like language or

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,570
[Music]

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:38,830
if your smile contracts but that's not

00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:41,220
touch the box chain today and also

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,370
highly part of the code in general I

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,590
even if you don't care that much about

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:50,770
your don't especially care about wisdom

00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:54,070
it's generally it may be a good idea if

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:59,560
your library offer especially to still

00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:03,459
try to be noisy competitor but yeah and

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:07,600
just don't use the you don't want you

00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:12,520
like if your work for method why don't

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:15,510
you just not use it we see it with an

00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:19,270
example let's just create a new crate

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,540
yeah new by the quick add noisy tom of

00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,420
the Mayoress have a dependency and then

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,150
try to build it for like a noisy target

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:32,950
this should be like a welcome for the

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:34,810
cortex m4 awesome character and banna it

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,959
will explode or give you like an

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,540
unpretty error crate STD not found

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:44,799
if you don't even have idea what are the

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:48,280
SD is or not will probably confuse you

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,340
and it also has like bad property that

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:55,000
is very bad to locate where it comes

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,489
from it can basically it will appear

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,560
like the error location will be a very

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,120
strange place you probably not find or

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,950
like you will find it and it doesn't

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,980
help you much which is not that fun yeah

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:12,549
and that's where we come to first

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:16,660
problem it's basically there is se

00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:20,049
infection happening like every year once

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:25,270
you have one dependency the poison your

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:28,090
status in a library your yeah you know

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,820
in a good place and the big problem is

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,520
every dependency you will do so by

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,660
default because at top of every crate

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,020
you have like auto print that's why I

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,110
never

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,960
you can always in your calls coach have

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,560
a statement of use SEO FS et cetera

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:52,180
because hidden on top the rust compiler

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:55,900
basically inserts like XM greatest V and

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,610
the other stuff things and yeah it's

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,340
generally a nice convenient spot feature

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:04,090
and you can also turn it off with no

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,910
tree root attribute but it doesn't have

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,990
you much and even if you in the crate

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,479
where you're using all those

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,910
dependencies but no a/c on top

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,210
you must I gathered you have no way of

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:19,060
preventing is really so every pendency

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:22,660
yes we have the snow ste quite attribute

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,280
which is not great because then we

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,610
essentially have to screen all your

00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,460
dependencies for one crash that might

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,620
not might be missing it and that's

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:36,010
exactly the reason why a third character

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,800
no because I got that cryptic error

00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,860
message and then I had to look for true

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,190
like 20 tendencies sometimes there's

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,350
some dependencies and in the end I

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,840
didn't even find it which we come to

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:53,710
later because there's like another

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:57,820
tricky things are in the about and also

00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:00,910
it's not great because it because every

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:04,510
year crate has to have it it puts like a

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:07,470
lot of burden on maintainer and also can

00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:10,210
fracture like the ecosystem some people

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,460
like for especially for other crates

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,990
that don't have noticed esupport because

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,690
back then embedded wasn't that big

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,150
wasn't wasn't that big people are

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:22,120
starting to pour big crates and also

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,680
have to like republish the crate on a

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,500
different thing so you can actually

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,750
published it on credit IO and all that

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,190
stuff and one excuse example is like

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,860
it's a really small crate it hasn't

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,950
better to research but actually on some

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,520
problems really or I found it causing

00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:43,690
trouble as I really

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,199
it's a very simple create four lines of

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,630
code

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:52,150
some people just hug you crazy boys

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:55,449
shouldn't exist and there is one port

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:58,449
which is adds to balance of no and in

00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:02,110
university because that is required by

00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:04,810
law and yeah so you don't want to screen

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,319
all dependencies and that's where

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:10,720
carbonyl comes to rescue you just run in

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,340
cargo no no check and then here right

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,979
now we only have the one dependency

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:19,720
server and then it especially tells you

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:24,280
why s/he is included and what you can

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,490
maybe you talk about that and for

00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:31,419
example one easy way a lot of crates

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:35,159
luckily at least introduce optional each

00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:36,880
of the opto support like if you want you

00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:40,180
totally correct the employee

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,069
dependencies you often can turn the

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:47,440
whole of pictures of your dependencies

00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:50,229
up in this case seven and then you yeah

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,380
do you create your own feature and then

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:56,050
you can also pass the exact same options

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:59,050
you would pass to carbon to carbon

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,990
object here the - there's no default

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:05,050
features which will also really totally

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:10,659
quickly chat flags and behind the scenes

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:14,940
like how I'm flattered it's really fits

00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:14,940
here to the Russell town because it's

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:23,979
yeah basically is pausing and then

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,719
resolving feature Thomas and this is a

00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:28,569
great great if you want to do anything

00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:30,969
related to about your last connection

00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:35,469
you like the structure of your s code

00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:37,479
stuff like that um it basically tries to

00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,370
detect at the entry point which is

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,950
likely always confined to one five and

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:45,070
that's comparatively easy to find out

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:47,920
which while it is it tries to detect if

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,520
there is like some text equivalent you

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,300
does a simple

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,390
like always on know a CD attribute or

00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:00,470
like a very simple conditional like this

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:02,990
one basically is a conditional yeah

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:07,640
picture talking about where if you don't

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:11,029
at the feature an SD active it turns on

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,120
the no se support which is sometimes I'm

00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:17,170
not you in a city environments get

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:24,700
better performance and keep the

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:27,860
corridors yeah and then then we know

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,200
then we know what the feature is called

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,050
it doesn't have to be specifically sed

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:38,600
it can be named a few different things

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:43,910
there like common names I think new onyx

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:46,790
but doesn't matter much and then we I

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:51,589
basically had to implement the complete

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:53,980
feature resolution Cognos not double

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,660
dependency resolution Agra broccoli and

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,750
takes them like all the dependencies

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:03,140
that are the creped and any dependencies

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:05,690
and then with the feature policy passed

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,660
it tries to replicate which features are

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:11,900
armed and which are not and it also has

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:16,370
to replicate what I would call behavior

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:19,459
but it has propagated right now or I'm

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:22,790
not sure if it's easy to move without

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:24,920
being a breaking change which is those

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,560
features of dependencies enabled if

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,709
they're able in dependencies which means

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,540
if in your bill dependencies which the

00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:34,940
most common cause I've seen the server

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,540
because you maybe want to read an attack

00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,720
that type of Jason and then you're set

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:46,370
up so the dependency has a severe

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:48,320
activated and then you also have an

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,500
active in the number two kind of the

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,300
normal currencies and then you get a

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,260
little promise there are some words to

00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:00,850
work around that for example setting a

00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,859
specific version 242 service then it

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:06,160
loads it into chunks one for the cold

00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:07,479
one for number one but that's not great

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,519
and that was also the reason why

00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:10,869
initially I screened all my dependencies

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,289
and didn't find it because I didn't

00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:16,289
think my dependencies belong like

00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:22,779
dependencies he just wants me talking

00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:28,179
about it on words yeah and one pain

00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:31,449
point about it also was how sadly yeah

00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:41,009
because there are I mean Derek how goes

00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:43,749
wait but it is a pretty huge monolithic

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:46,119
big is fade it would mean because it's

00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:48,639
pretty what you learn that farmers like

00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:50,859
the sacraments pretty well but if you

00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,679
won't choose the library it's not the

00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:56,889
dice it's like one you can't just say I

00:11:53,679 --> 00:12:02,439
want to stuff related to like fetching

00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:05,979
plates or or for example resin resolving

00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:08,319
the future problems and so if you

00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:10,720
included it's like a huge dependencies

00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,209
there are some ways around that there is

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,799
cognitive decline which is the Congo

00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:16,809
sacrament and there was an Associated

00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:23,979
crate which makes it very easy to

00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:26,679
consume and then I've heard there are

00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:29,319
some ambitions for the packaging to

00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:35,559
change that to make it more visible for

00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:39,179
supplements but I also don't know and

00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:43,989
yeah so we come together second problem

00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:46,829
which is my library is building which is

00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:49,899
not that much of a problem in of itself

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:52,139
but here it's a bit annoying because

00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:54,639
when you're building lab you crates

00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:57,399
contrary to the binary credited earlier

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,679
you don't get any feedback at all it

00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,199
will just sign if you pass you think oh

00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:07,659
yeah sorry no no no it's D conditions

00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:11,380
but it isn't which I think I don't know

00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:14,700
but I think it is because we're

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:17,950
it's lightweight it basically doesn't

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,620
burn an executable and only executables

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:24,190
are specifically like good for one time

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,890
it except for like target toggles and

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,140
stuff like that but I think that's the

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:32,280
run this is it

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,280
someone can jump in if they know better

00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:42,430
yeah and that's also very common or

00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:48,280
tries to help again this is this is like

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:50,920
console output if you did not find it

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,050
was new attribute and then tell you hey

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,140
maybe you been on top maybe you want to

00:13:53,050 --> 00:14:00,400
do the optional feature though STD

00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:04,150
toggle or not and it will also try to

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,550
help you in another way and if you

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,580
especially especially have like like a

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:13,980
specific use a CD statement and will

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:18,850
tell you at which location and then also

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:21,100
if it works suggest this is replacement

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,010
because a lot of the stuff in the SE or

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,680
like what looks dead it does peidong CSV

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,140
isn't actually in ESP it's actually in

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,210
the core library which is a bit

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:39,730
different I mean it's also an

00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:43,360
automatically route and yeah like

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,850
operations market trades stuff religious

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:52,480
noises and still there and that's also

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:54,820
stuff you still want to use and that's

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,630
also one point where it's like really

00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:01,870
easy to switch your libraries but you

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:04,120
have no SD support to do essentially

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:09,640
just the job has to be for court and

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:13,630
that it works yeah behind the scenes of

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:16,090
this again compositing and rough

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:20,170
documentation interesting because I

00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:24,430
needed to find some way to check if

00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:28,270
something that's in STD is also

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:32,050
and the easiest way to do that what I

00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:34,450
found was to rely on the fact that every

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,630
rustle installation comes with

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,640
documentation by by default if you

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:42,880
install it with rust up in other cases

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,950
you probably will get some problems and

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,560
we use that we just basically a

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:50,050
background rather rust up with rust off

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,470
which gives you the path of the rust

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:56,050
documentation and there we look hey we

00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:00,490
first basically search hey where is the

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:03,880
documentation for the this STD item we

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:06,850
included and like go to directories up

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:11,080
or like as many directories the belt

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:14,140
belt and check yeah one directly over to

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,870
core go down there if something is there

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:20,140
at the same location there's a very good

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,730
chance that it still works there is it

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,450
doesn't always work because sometimes

00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:28,060
same items exist for all right I just

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,570
exist or SV and core but they are a bit

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,430
different

00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:35,260
like for example yeah some constants or

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,020
numbers I think are missing in

00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:43,870
coordinate in the sphere or stuff like

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:46,959
that and generally darest caveat of

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:50,890
carbon overall it's like very your

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:53,200
sequence it as you've seen there's like

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:57,400
a lot of code parsing if stuff isn't

00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:00,010
exactly as it is it will break down for

00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,020
example here if you have like a complex

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:04,530
each apology for University features

00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,100
which I've seen a few times in the why

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:12,309
it doesn't work

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:16,620
and in general like most great I checked

00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:20,500
out the sons like two small pixels for

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:24,870
it generally was either like it did a

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:27,880
good job of scanning or evaluating if it

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:29,500
if its opponent noisy or not and in

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,650
generally is also better in a way that

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:37,090
that there are no false negatives I

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,840
think like it will tell you it might

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,750
throw

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,390
wrong Arashi way but it generally

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:48,929
doesn't tell you hey this crate supports

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:53,260
no STD if the crate doesn't and yeah

00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:56,049
what's in the future Dara is on one side

00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:00,669
one thing I'm currently trying to add to

00:17:56,049 --> 00:18:02,740
no SD - Calvin oh no we're just a work

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:07,390
in progress and I hope to get it out

00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:10,390
before his talk but that we did there is

00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:14,470
a way which could be you know some 90

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:17,230
features like LLVM tools and to actually

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,140
standard artifacts for SD symbols which

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:25,510
would work for both binary and my wrists

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:28,779
and doesn't rely on realize unless

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:32,440
heuristics and and is looks to be pretty

00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:35,260
spot-on in checking yourself but yeah

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,240
also realize nightly so it well and I

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,059
think it will for quite some time source

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,600
will always just be a secondary mode for

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:47,380
target oh no and there is one bigger

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,720
thing which I'm not about them M which

00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,510
is SD of air cargo which is the big

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,360
thing which if that comes through

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:59,620
luckily you probably won't need power

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,470
available that takes care of the fact

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:07,059
that car currently isn't even a bearer

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:09,880
of STD as a thing essentially like in

00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:14,110
the background SC and core like normal

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,270
libraries mostly but only the rest

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,279
compiler knows about them automatically

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:21,760
includes them and they never touch

00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:24,070
carlos do carmo Asif can tell program

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:29,140
hate compile of outdoors you forgot sir

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:31,330
and this RFC year which is also from one

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:37,330
of the people from persistence

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:39,309
interesting and tries to fix that but it

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,260
would also take some time for this

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:43,330
bubble solution to arrive at Sierra

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,700
cargo like knocking you know as an RC

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,930
still pretty new and have to go to the

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:53,460
review process etc and

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:56,100
yeah that's why if that's one not the

00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,140
thoughts I want to like giving away the

00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,480
proper solutions can take a long time to

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,910
arrive and there is no shame in using

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,920
something happy if it helps you the

00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,890
meantime I also think no shame in

00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:13,070
advertising like I often I mean I do it

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:15,810
today and also randomly on the rust

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:19,520
subreddit like a lot a lot of times

00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:22,470
stuff create University comes up and I

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,750
just plug it and tell people hey maybe

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:34,890
try scanning it with that like do it for

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:37,950
them and and also there is another like

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:40,620
very similar project which ever just

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,390
have a bad lens which checks for dead

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,480
links in your documentation like if

00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,700
you're linking from one item to another

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:52,560
item for a long time they are busy

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,930
hasn't been something in rust in Rostock

00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,850
then it lets you do that and now slowly

00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,010
I think it's still kinda like if you

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,900
check it there is a feature who

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,550
basically makes a pair of sweet but I

00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,070
was happy that I had it in the mean time

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,350
and yeah that's about it

00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,530
contributors and commentators are always

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,180
welcome there are another features

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:15,210
smaller features and also improvements

00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:18,030
on the way so if you use it and find it

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:21,090
some ways to prove it I'm very happy to

00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:30,390
hear of us and you can also find me on

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:32,960
github or città as and I'm also any

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,960
questions

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,829
[Applause]

00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:53,610
oh there is an issue for it I firstly

00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,060
haven't have to use much for like the

00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:59,520
separate things and there it also fits

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,770
less like there are few much more

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,340
different approaches in the wild on how

00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:12,360
people handle like em and turn em off

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:14,550
and sometimes noisy so I mean yeah I

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:19,230
would like to have in there - yeah and

00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:22,050
also yeah I mean there are rock dance

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:56,490
but it's also not a priority of mine

00:22:22,050 --> 00:23:05,480
personally if anyone I mean Adam of the

00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:08,340
teacher for like off the attribute I

00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,160
mean it has to do with the automatically

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:14,640
dude like because by default you will

00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,590
get the next year for your page provided

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:34,110
to you by us and you have to use their

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:36,120
attributes turn around or oh you mean

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,650
you do you want to turn it out because

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:45,210
you want to turn something something

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:47,070
different then I mean sometimes you

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,679
don't for libraries at least you can one

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,110
need it at all like you

00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,649
do something that's on generic core

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:57,019
operations maybe then you don't read it

00:23:54,649 --> 00:24:01,309
and think but they are not advanced

00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:03,980
enough or in my method stuff but I think

00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:09,470
most embedded systems like provide their

00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:11,869
own their own if I understand the

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:16,369
question correctly I think like rust

00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:17,809
also uses Lipsey on a lot of targets but

00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:20,179
if you want to use a different lip see

00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:21,940
like Musil or muzzle or however you

00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:26,990
pronounce it you it's a different target

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:30,169
yes for most usually that's the thing

00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,419
too third triple yeah also like you have

00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:34,759
to spoil their targets and those triples

00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,530
I think usually for triple refers to

00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:39,910
what Stanley

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,910
[Music]

00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:49,070
so the RUS standard library and Lipsy

00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:50,690
are two separate things like Lipsy is

00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,039
really just talking like with your

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,049
operating system whereas the standard

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,720
library gives you it's more like the C++

00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:59,330
standard library like keep allocated

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,149
collections you know fancy stuff like

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,889
that so it's better to think about C++

00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:28,269
standard library than the C standard

00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:32,809
library some crates have like optional

00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:35,299
support and usually they provide like

00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:39,700
the down variants I think for the red

00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:42,950
express crate that applies there is

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,520
where it's slightly slower as if you

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:48,570
have a seat

00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:53,660
and do some fancy stuff that works we

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:53,660
have located some stuff

00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,619
[Music]

00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:09,780
it's simply whether you have the ability

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,510
to use standard library like strokes and

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,940
methods and stuff like that or not so if

00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,760
you're not using them and you don't

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:20,160
declare no SCD there's basically no

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,050
difference except that crates that one

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,390
to use you that don't that can't use the

00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:26,820
standard library can't use you it simply

00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,440
because of the flag like that doesn't

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,050
change the flag doesn't change the

00:26:28,440 --> 00:27:08,760
symbols at all it just says you're not

00:26:31,050 --> 00:27:10,710
going to use standard library I think

00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:28,040
they're one of the main problems is that

00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:28,040
with no s you can't run tests in no se I

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:48,240
think I mean if you know more maybe but

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,660
as far as I'm aware like test harness

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,380
which also builds the examples with the

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:56,660
and there you essentially and also have

00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,090
I think the same problem of feature

00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,460
Tonko like the great dependency spilling

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,440
over the teacher progress of those so

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,900
like from what I haven't tried that

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,070
myself from what I've heard it's pretty

00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,650
hard to test

00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:12,010
no STD committed relieved of examples or

00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,010
test

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,670
