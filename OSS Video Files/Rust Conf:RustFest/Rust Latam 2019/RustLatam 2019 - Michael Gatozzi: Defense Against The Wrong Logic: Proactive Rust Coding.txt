Title: RustLatam 2019 - Michael Gatozzi: Defense Against The Wrong Logic: Proactive Rust Coding
Publication date: 2019-04-21
Playlist: Rust Latam 2019
Description: 
	Rust guarantees memory safety, but it doesnâ€™t stop you from doing everything. From unsafe to unwrap and more, there are lots of ways for you to subvert and make your code fail due to our own mistakes: logic bugs and incorrect assumptions.

Come along and learn Rust techniques and patterns that will help build safe guards into your code, test your assumptions, and get a better understanding of what Rust and you can guarantee with your code.

All so you can sleep sounder at night and not be woken up at 3am while on call.
