Title: RustLatam 2019 - Florian Gilcher: The Power of the "Where" Clause
Publication date: 2019-04-21
Playlist: Rust Latam 2019
Description: 
	Rust expresses trait bounds using the where clause. It is an essential tool for all generic Rust programming. Yet, many Rust programmers don't know about the full expressiveness of it!

This talk guides us through most of the features and shows us how to creatively use where clauses to both keep our code clean and flexible, but also sound and hard to use in a wrong way.

This talk will teach us the basic building blocks to not get lost in a forest of constraints.
