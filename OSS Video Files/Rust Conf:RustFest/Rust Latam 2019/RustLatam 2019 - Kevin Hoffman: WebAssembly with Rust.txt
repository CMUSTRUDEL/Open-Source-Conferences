Title: RustLatam 2019 - Kevin Hoffman: WebAssembly with Rust
Publication date: 2019-04-21
Playlist: Rust Latam 2019
Description: 
	WebAssembly fulfills the long-awaited promise of web technologies: fast code, type-safe at compile time, execution in the browser, on embedded devices, or anywhere else. Rust delivers the power of C in a language that strictly enforces type safety. Combine both languages and you can write for the web like never before!

In this demo-heavy talk Kevin will take us on a journey from the basics of WebAssembly to using WebAssembly to integrate with JavaScript, build complete websites, and even host and interpret in Rust apps.

He'll even show hot-swapping WebAssembly modules to control LEDs on a Raspberry Pi.
