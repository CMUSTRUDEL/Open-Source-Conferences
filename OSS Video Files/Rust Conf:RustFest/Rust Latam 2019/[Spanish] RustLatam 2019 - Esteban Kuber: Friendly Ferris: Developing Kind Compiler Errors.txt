Title: [Spanish] RustLatam 2019 - Esteban Kuber: Friendly Ferris: Developing Kind Compiler Errors
Publication date: 2019-04-21
Playlist: Rust Latam 2019
Description: 
	The Rust Compiler is quickly becoming well known for its helpful messages, going out of its way to provide relevant suggestions to common problems.

As the Rust language reaches more people, the compiler is having to cater to both newcomers and highly experienced developers who may write incredibly complex code.

In turn, this means that diagnostics need to be comprehensive enough for newcomers without being distracting to those already familiar with the language. Making rustc act as a personalized tutor is useful for newcomers and has contributed to the language's growing popularity. However, it requires a lot of upfront work and foresight from the developers of the compiler.

During this talk we will cover the current guiding principles of rustc development, how you can contribute to the compiler, and where to find documentation and help.
