Description: 
	In-break Artist Performance from RustFest Global 2020
Music: Lina Bautista / Linalab
Visuals: Diego Suárez / !ME

Linalab && !ME are Lina Bautista and Diego Suárez, two artists who crossed their paths for continuing their explorations about the analogic and manual side of both music and image. They seek to create sound and visual landscapes getting the farest away from digital methods and generating it in real time, giving the show an improvisation character.

Linalab is a multiple singularity. It's a whole and a unity, a solitary sound, and a note. A frequency that remains in time to become more complex, to become entangled, to become noise; melody, song and then silence. She composed her first work, Ecliptica, inside a telescope imitating its shape, but instead of superimposing lenses to enhance the look and observe the universe, she superimposed sound layers – field recordings, guitars and voices – to produce complex textures that, when added, they do not see, but touch the universe. In her second album, Doom, she imagines how the end of the world should sound. Proposes four possible scenarios and to each one, she carefully constructs a scaled model, resulting in four small destruction: four small sound apocalypses. In her most recent work, Still Alive, she realized that there is no doomsday, only intermediate days. There is no apocalypse, no epic destruction, only infinite rearrangements of particles that originate further infinite sonic possibilities.
