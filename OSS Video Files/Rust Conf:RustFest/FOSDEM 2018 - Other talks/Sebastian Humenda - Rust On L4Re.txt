Title: Sebastian Humenda - Rust On L4Re
Publication date: 2018-02-06
Playlist: FOSDEM 2018 - Other talks
Description: 
	Safe Language Meets Safe Microkernel

Rust is a modern systems programming language with compiler-enforced memory-safety guarantees, safe concurrency and a powerful type system. L4Re offers safety features on the operating system level through isolation and virtualisation. Both together can form a unique combination for reliable and secure services. In this talk, I will present my port of Rust to L4Re and discuss some of the challenges of integrating the compiler Rustc into a different build system. I will also discuss future work on how to apply Rust's strong type system to L4Re IPC.
