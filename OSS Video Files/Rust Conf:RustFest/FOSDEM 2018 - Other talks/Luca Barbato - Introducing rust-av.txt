Title: Luca Barbato - Introducing rust-av
Publication date: 2019-02-06
Playlist: FOSDEM 2018 - Other talks
Description: 
	A pure-Rust approach to multimedia

Multimedia development is mainly done in C+assembly since speed is important and such combination of languages traditionally gives the best control over the hardware.

Rust is considered a mature system language that provides strong warranties about memory access (and more) without sacrificing runtime speed.

Multimedia libraries are plagued by classes of bugs that Rust actively prevents at compile time, thus this talk is about leveraging Rust to have a multimedia framework that is nice to use and at the same time more trustworthy.

Target audience is people with some Rust knowledge and some experience with multimedia libraries and concepts.
