Title: A little Rusty in Quantum Physics
Publication date: 2020-11-06
Playlist: Oxidize Global 2020
Description: 
	Embedded Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs) and other Rust frameworks work well for demos and prototype projects, but how do they hold up in real-world, professional implementations?

Stabilizer is an open-sourced hardware platform used for controlling lasers in quantum physics experiments. It offers a unique environment to exercise the usage of embedded HAL traits and the Real-Time For the Masses (RTFM) framework in a high-performance, internet-connected embedded system.

This talk will discuss the advantages (and shortfalls) of the both RTFM and the embedded HAL approach to Rust development in a real-world embedded application where timing, throughput, and internet-connectivity are crucial.
