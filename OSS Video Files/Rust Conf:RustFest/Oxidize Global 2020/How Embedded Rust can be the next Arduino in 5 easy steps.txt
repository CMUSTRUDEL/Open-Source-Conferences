Title: How Embedded Rust can be the next Arduino in 5 easy steps

Description: 
	For the past 15 years, Arduino has been the gold standard for introducing people to Embedded Systems and programming. This talk outlines 5 steps that Rust can do to increase “market share” in the hobbyist sector.

Some of these steps are already in progress and will require little extra effort. Others are not obvious and will require resources to be allocated to them. These are not traditionally core to the Rust project and would require alternative processes to be set up.

By doing this work, however, we can increase the visibility of Rust in the Embedded space and have more Rustaceans trying to increase software quality in a fast growing sector.
