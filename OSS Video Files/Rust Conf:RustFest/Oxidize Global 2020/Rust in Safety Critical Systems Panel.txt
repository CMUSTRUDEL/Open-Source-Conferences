Title: Rust in Safety Critical Systems Panel
Publication date: 2020-11-06
Playlist: Oxidize Global 2020
Description: 
	The Rust Programming Language has a lot to offer software developers: Memory Safety, Developer Convenience, and powerful static analysis tooling. However, introducing a new programming language like Rust into a Safety Critical domain for writing software for automotive, industrial, medical, or avionics purposes requires a high level of confidence, and a lot of regulatory hurdles.

This panel will discuss what makes developing software for the safety critical industry so different from other development areas, how Rust could be an improvement to the Status Quo of safety critical software development, and potential roadblocks Rust could experience on the way to a safety critical qualification. Join engineers with experience in a number of safety critical industries including compiler design, the automotive industry, and the testing and verification industry to discuss!
