Publication date: 2020-11-06
Playlist: Oxidize Global 2020
Description: 
	Writing a device driver can be a lot of work, writing a good one even more.

In this talk, we’ll explore some different styles of writing to and reading from registers and we’ll be weighing the pros and the cons. It will not conclude with a definitive best way, but hopefully it will give some ideas to use for the next driver you write.

The library discussed in this talk has also been publicly released since the talk was recorded: https://crates.io/crates/device-driver
