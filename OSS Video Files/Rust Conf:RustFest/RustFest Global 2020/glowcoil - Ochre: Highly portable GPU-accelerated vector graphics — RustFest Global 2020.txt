Title: glowcoil - Ochre: Highly portable GPU-accelerated vector graphics â€” RustFest Global 2020
Publication date: 2020-12-19
Playlist: RustFest Global 2020
Description: 
	As screen resolutions and refresh rates increase, user interfaces increasingly need to make use of GPU acceleration in order to achieve good performance and battery life. However, the wide range of existing GPU feature sets and APIs makes it difficult to do so in a portable manner. Ochre is a Rust library for vector graphics and text rendering which is structured to take advantage of the performance strengths of GPUs while remaining portable to diverse situations, including older hardware, laptops, mobile devices, and WebGL.
