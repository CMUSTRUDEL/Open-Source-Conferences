[MONRHEA] is a Producer and DJ, brewing in the underground music scene in Nairobi and beyond. For about a year, she has been learning to code music using Sonic Pi which she says has opened up a whole new dimension for music exploration and experimentation. Creations using this tool landed her a review on Resident Advisor for the track, "The Sonics from a River in Ololua Forest". She hopes to spread the world of music coding by creating a platform called BYTE which is dedicated to the Sonic Pi Community.
