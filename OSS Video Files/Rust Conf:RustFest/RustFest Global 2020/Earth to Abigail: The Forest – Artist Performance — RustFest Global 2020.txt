	Live Coding Session Using Sonic Pi, In-break Artist Performance from RustFest Global 2020
Music & Visuals: Earth To Abigail (Mynah Marie)

Mynah Marie, a.k.a. Earth To Abigail, takes us for a walk in an algorithmic forest where sounds represent not only nature but a deep conversation inside ourselves. Combining her voice with Sonic Pi, the song "The Forest" is meant to be an inspirational soundscape as well as a form of inner dialogue.

Born in Montreal, Canada from a Portuguese family, Mynah Marie has been living the life of a nomad for the past 15 years. After pursuing undergraduate studies in classical piano, she left her hometown at the age of 21 to embark on her first long-term journey. The necessity to find an instrument she could carry around while backpacking across the country is what led her to buy her first accordion.
