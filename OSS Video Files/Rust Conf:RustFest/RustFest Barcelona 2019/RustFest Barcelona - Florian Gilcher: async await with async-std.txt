Title: RustFest Barcelona - Florian Gilcher: async await with async-std
Publication date: 2019-11-28
Playlist: RustFest Barcelona 2019
Description: 
	async/await will be stabilised around RustFest Barcelona. This talk gives an overview of the existing ecosystem by then as well as practical guidance on how to use the feature. It puts a focus on modern async programming instead of comparisons with the past. For exemplary purposes, I will use async-std, a library built from the ground up around std::futures::Future and the modern async model.
