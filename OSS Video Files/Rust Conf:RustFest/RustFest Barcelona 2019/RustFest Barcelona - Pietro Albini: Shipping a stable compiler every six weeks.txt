Title: RustFest Barcelona - Pietro Albini: Shipping a stable compiler every six weeks
Publication date: 2019-11-29
Playlist: RustFest Barcelona 2019
Description: 
	A new version of the Rust compiler is released every six weeks, with lots of new features and bug fixes in it. So far the Rust team managed to ship stable releases on schedule with almost no regressions, ensuring everyone can upgrade their toolchain without fear of broken builds. This talk explains how our release process works and the tools we developed to catch regressions before our users do.
