Publication date: 2019-11-29
Playlist: RustFest Barcelona 2019
Description: 
	People talk about cost in software development. We know about runtime cost, compile-time cost, and even monetary-cost. People are aware that all of these are metrics that are important when discussing productivity.

What about the human cost?

What causes people to burn out, why do we work in an industry where everybody only ever focuses on “productivity” and what really needs to happen to stop any of this from happening.
