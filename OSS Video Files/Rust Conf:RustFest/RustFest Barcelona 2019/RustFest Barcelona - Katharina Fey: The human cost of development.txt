Title: RustFest Barcelona - Katharina Fey: The human cost of development
Publication date: 2019-11-29
Playlist: RustFest Barcelona 2019
Description: 
	People talk about cost in software development. We know about runtime cost, compile-time cost, and even monetary-cost. People are aware that all of these are metrics that are important when discussing productivity.

What about the human cost?

What causes people to burn out, why do we work in an industry where everybody only ever focuses on “productivity” and what really needs to happen to stop any of this from happening.

	00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,190
All right, sorry for that.

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,990
I had it working immediately the last time and now I was kind of confused why it caused

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,130
problems.

00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,330
So thank you all for coming and thank you for watching and to one particular person

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,210
on the live stream right now.

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,000
I hope you've had a good RustFest so far.

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,340
I know I have.

00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,770
I really like the way that the talks were split across two days because it gave me more

00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,680
time to think about them and to talk to people about what I've heard.

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,710
It was less crammed so a big thumbs up to the organisers.

00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,829
I really like that.

00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,250
I have been given the privilege to close out the talk track today and it also means that

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,670
I'm the last hurdle before lunch so I will try not to take up too much of your time.

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,780
I want to take this opportunity to talk about something that's pretty important to me and

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,120
I feel that it should be more important to all of us as a community.

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,440
So for those of you who don't know me, here is a quick intro.

00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,430
My name is Katharina Fey, I have been involved in the Rust community since 2017.

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,850
I started writing Rust because I wanted to write a DNS server.

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,780
Please don't ask.

00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,320
I'm currently a freelancer and you can hire me but please don't do it all at once.

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,990
I write a lot of free software and I am also one of those people who says free software

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,670
instead of open source.

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,520
Also I like shaving yaks, and my current yak is emails.

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,350
I will be giving a lightning talk later about this by the way.

00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,760
I travel a lot and I write some software and I have a pet shark called Nibble which is

00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,690
the smaller sibling to a larger shark called Bite.

00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,960
[Laughter] I think this tweet sums up what I do pretty

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,420
well.

00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,390
I don't really like doing questions on stage, it's kind of awkward for me, but you can send

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,310
me an email or for the five other people using XMPP it's the same thing as my email.

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,530
I'm on Twitter, also known as the hell site, or just come talk to me.

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,920
I don't usually bite.

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,180
So this talk comes with a few disclaimers.

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,200
The first disclaimer, and this was already mentioned, is that this is not a technical

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,440
talk.

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,170
I will try to visualise some problems in the industry and none of that really requires

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,810
any code.

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,310
Just more abstract things.

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,570
There's no code on the actual slides, well, except for one.

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,819
I recently used async-std and it was really awesome and I just wanted to say that I really

00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:48,840
love it.

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,290
Disclaimer number two is that this talk is not based on personal experience.

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,350
Well, okay, it's not only based on personal experience.

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,880
All of these issues can and do affect us all and I think it is important that we talk about

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,870
them.

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,500
Disclaimer number three is that my slides are kind of boring.

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,709
I wrote this talk as a sort of essay and I will - mostly the slides are a way for me

00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,270
to get through my speaker notes.

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,890
I think it is more important to listen to what I say and also the script is in the speaker

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,340
notes and I will upload the slides.

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,680
The slides are mostly there so that you have something to look at that's not my face.

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,270
The talk also comes with a content warning for anxiety, burnout and depression and if

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,360
you are one of those people who don't like content warnings, I invite you to grow up,

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,310
please.

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,459
So there's a few things that I want to talk about and at first glance you might think

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:51,620
that these issues aren't really connected, but I feel that they are and I hope that over

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,520
the course of this talk you will come to agree with me that there's a larger perspective

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,440
to consider and maybe together we can start working towards a better world.

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,510
I don't claim to have any answers but I do want to start a discussion.

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,200
But it will be okay.

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,879
It's fine.

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,989
So first of all I want to talk about technical debt.

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,549
What exactly is technical debt?

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,060
Well, as Rust developers you probably don't really know what that is.

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,880
It's a term that only recently - more recently came up as large companies have started dealing

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,060
with their technical debt.

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,840
Unfortunately, this means that a lot of the discussion and talks about it happen as to

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,500
how to get rid of it, not why it is happening.

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,430
Technical debt is just like any other debt but for the tech stack of a company.

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,790
Generally when developing systems sometimes engineers take shortcuts or make bad choices.

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,080
Stuff happens and then, poof, there's legacy code.

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,220
Maybe someone was fired who understood it all and then no one else can, or maybe you

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,250
had to push yourself to make bad decisions for release or something, so either over time

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,190
or sometimes with bad decisions technical debt is created.

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,560
Now, I want to run through a small example here and again this will have no code but

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,810
I think it will sort of demonstrate how this happens and I think this will feel pretty

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,060
familiar.

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,410
So take Foo Ltd, a fictitious company.

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,919
They ship their first product that does serverless cloud computing on the blockchain and they

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,420
are very proud.

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,030
Unfortunately, to push out their product they had to do some - write some hacks.

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,070
Some of the code isn't as cool as they would want it to be.

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,889
It kind of looks weird and pointy.

00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,729
Some of the engineers want to go back and re-write some of it to be nicer and have a

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:54,729
nicer architecture.

00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:00,360
The next funding milestone is due and they also have a large client, Oogle, who would

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,660
like to use their tech, so instead they hack around it and they ship this.

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:13,110
They apply some duck tape and, you know, get more money and do more cool things but it

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,750
can does mean that the investors are now happy, it also means the work that should be done

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,640
never gets done.

00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,950
What is happening here?

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:28,449
Well, money from either investors or clients is exchanged for technical debt.

00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:37,400
So when you start looking into why technical debt happens, or if you generally look into

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,290
the issue, most of the articles, most of the discussion is how to deal with it and I guess

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,290
that's fair.

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,130
A lot of companies have large technical debt issues and it would be an obvious question

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,100
how to get rid of it.

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,690
There are some good resources out there, how to do this, and I don't really want to get

00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,360
into this right now.

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,389
Some of it is just refactoring techniques, throwing away code, all of these things.

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,320
I feel it's a space that's pretty well covered and I don't think me sitting here or standing

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,160
here and talking about it is going to add anything.

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,039
Needless to say, I feel that if your company has technical debt there are resources out

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,620
there to learn how to deal with them.

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,789
In my opinion it is much more interesting to ask the question why.

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:26,880
Why is technical debt created?

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:35,360
So I started researching this a few months ago I think at this point and really there's

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,990
a few reasons but the most prevalent ones that I could find were these four, so the

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,600
Internet says: making sacrifices for a deadline, which was the example we just saw earlier;

00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,030
bad decisions from engineers.

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,210
You know, sometimes people make bad choices and then it bites them in the arse.

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,770
Systems getting old or talent going away, someone just leaves the company and no one

00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:02,301
understands it, and bitrot which in this case means a module that gets re-factored over

00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:09,979
and over and over again to do more and more things to the point where it doesn't really

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:14,380
do anything well anymore and it's not really understandable.

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,960
Now, I will grant you that there's a lot of reasons why technical debt happens, but none

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,259
of them are technical.

00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,020
They are all social problems.

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,440
People make bad decisions sometimes but it's in the framework of their company that these

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,180
decisions become technical debt.

00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,990
Not letting your engineers go back and fix their mistakes is how you create technical

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,940
debt and honestly the same applies to making sacrifices for a deadline.

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,770
If you as a company, not an individual, have to write some hacks to get your product out

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,120
the door and then you don't go back and let the people who did those hacks go back and

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:59,210
fix it, that's creating technical debt but it's not the engineers' fault.

00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,910
People don't really work in a vacuum.

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,200
It's the people's fault who did the time planning and who didn't allow for the people that - for

00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,750
the engineers who worked on this to sort of build a working environment where they can

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,130
do the things that they wanted.

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,180
Companies make a lot of decisions all the time and some of them are greedy, I guess,

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:27,270
and then after a while of doing this over and over again, they start to pay the price.

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:32,480
So I want to run through another example with Foo Ltd, and by the way I want to thank my

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,880
friend Rebecca @HazelnutXYZ on Twitter who made these in two hours' notice and my design

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,430
direction was: engineering fuck up.

00:09:44,430 --> 00:10:07,130
So for my last example, Foo Ltd is doing pretty well, they have two clients, Oogl and Amadont.

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:14,120
Unfortunately your product is a bit of a monolith so there is a module in there that interacts

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,269
with your cloud and it can't really be removed.

00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:22,640
The most sensible way of dealing with this would be to pull out something from your core

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:31,440
and write a thing that enables plugins to interact with your core but that sounds expensive

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,060
so why not just copy and paste some code and build this wonderful tech stack?

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:46,600
So again, being put into the situation where either you can do something right or do something

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,010
fast, the fast way is the one that ends up with an unmaintainable code base.

00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:59,360
I want to take a small step back here and at least mention in part why I'm giving this

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,190
talk.

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,630
A few months ago I was at a conference that I don't want to name and I saw a talk there

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,800
that I don't want to identify and it handled the subject of technical debt and how throwing

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,480
away things can lead to nicer projects, instead of just refactoring, throw away your code,

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,020
and for the most part I really liked this talk right up to the point where it fell kind

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,870
of flat.

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:30,050
See, it's always possible to add new things and when you are tasked with doing something

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,610
- you can either do it in a maintainable way or in a bad way.

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,310
Depending on your situation, you will choose one or the other but the question that this

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:46,240
talk never dared to ask is: is there really a need to add more things, are potential clients

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:55,019
really that important that you sacrifice whatever you are building to the pictures that I just

00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,089
showed you earlier?

00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,550
They look huge as graphics.

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,450
They don't look as cute as hundreds of thousands of lines of C++.

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,710
Don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying that writing features is bad or that we shouldn't

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,710
make stuff.

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,050
What's the point of being alive if you can't write bad code?

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,170
[Laughter] I simply take issue with the idea that an

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,920
engineering department has to bend over backwards because some management people promised some

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,620
other management people a feature and the people who then have to do the work don't

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,450
get a shot at either coming up with alternatives, with more realistic deadlines, or finding

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,540
a nicer way of implementing it.

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,140
Even if you look - if you leave this aside and you only look at the effects of technical

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,630
debt, pretty much all the time the focus is on the company and I did this in my own talk

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,860
until this very moment.

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,959
I focused on how does technical debt impact Foo Ltd and not the people working at Foo

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,959
Ltd?

00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:59,330
Most of the articles that you will find on the Internet does this, or do this pretty

00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:04,440
much always, and the talk that I mentioned earlier did this all the way through to the

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,170
end.

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,370
Yes, even some research papers do this.

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,579
Productivity is the focus.

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:21,400
So what kind of effects can any of this have on people who actually have to work with these

00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:29,930
systems, and are humans with feelings and actual limits?

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:37,430
People talk about burnout very often the same way that they talk about technical debt.

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:44,210
This happens at conference talks and in online articles and, yes, also some research papers.

00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,110
A lot of the stuff that you will find is stuff like this.

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,290
Articles that go into detail how you personally can prevent yourself from burning out.

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,440
The issue of being overworked in your job is being put on you to deal with.

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,260
In a way, this reminds me of climate discourse.

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,970
You personally are responsible for killing the planet, not the system that you are forced

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,970
to live in.

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:11,660
I talked to quite a lot of people over the last few months, when preparing for this talk,

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,300
about their experiences with burnout, especially in tech; how they tried to deal with it; what

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,770
support they got from their companies or friends.

00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,420
Needless to say I have bunch or dirt on a bunch of companies now, so that's fun.

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,791
More importantly, it's a common theme, even when people describe their own burnout, not

00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,810
to focus themselves in that conversation.

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,730
There are people I kind of had to pry it out of, what their experience had been and what

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,829
they had gone through.

00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:43,640
At times it felt like a taboo thing to even talk about, on a personal level anyway.

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,970
Most were happy to talk about burnout industry-wide and oh yes, the tech industry has a real issue,

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,480
but I'm personally never affected.

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,410
You know?

00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:00,570
Productivity, again it's a term that's most often used and it frames the entire conversation

00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,589
about burnout, something that happens "to" individuals with regards to a company and

00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,600
the loss of labour that it causes.

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,329
This is very common.

00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:19,220
The only real sources of this that take burnout seriously I found were medical papers and

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,930
studying the negative effects that burnout can have on people with excruciating detail

00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:33,089
and charts and numbers of really just things that happen to people.

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:36,079
There's no slide here because it's depressing.

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,050
So instead of doing any of that, I want to be a bit more personal for a bit.

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,389
Part of changing the conversation means giving people the space to share their experience

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:50,490
and so I want to be at least one person on a stage that takes the issue seriously.

00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:59,209
Burnout is losing yourself to a job that you hate doing.

00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:06,589
Whatever you do, it's never enough, but you also feel like you want to do more.

00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:12,120
You are not being compensated, whatever that might mean, but you are too greedy if you

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,770
ask for more money and you are letting down your colleagues if you ask for vacation days.

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,490
Personally I also notice my creativity taking a dive whenever I burn out.

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:26,970
I usually make music or write stories, and yes, it has happened a few times before.

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,720
Burnout isn't something you even entirely realise is happening to you.

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,920
Sometimes it makes people anxious, sometimes it means people cry themselves to sleep.

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,550
For others, it means focusing so much on what they do, it becomes their whole identity.

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,269
They think of nothing else.

00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:42,910
They speak of nothing else.

00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,040
Literally, their job becomes their life.

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,080
How many people like that do you know?

00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,791
The phrase "oh no, I'm just stressed but not like ... burnt out", is pretty common, and

00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:57,640
I guess for some it would be admitting a kind of failure?

00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,220
I know it was for me.

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,579
Why am I talking about this at RustFest?

00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:07,409
I can already hear someone complain about how this is way too political, you came here

00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,289
for the Rust.

00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:14,220
First of all, okay, everything is political, whether you like it or not.

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,539
But secondly, and I think more importantly, Rust is a young language and the people who

00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:25,369
write Rust are largely people who do it because they think it's fun.

00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:28,269
We are a community that's built around hobbyists.

00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:34,070
The previous talk mentioned this, the compiler is largely being developed by volunteers.

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,169
Some people are even learning Rust as their first programming language and maybe a Rust

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:41,509
development job will be their first gig in tech.

00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:46,529
I think we owe it to those people, and to ourselves, that we give these issues a stage

00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:52,229
and talk about them because Rust projects often don't have technical debt yet, but the

00:17:52,229 --> 00:17:59,269
management structures that create it still exist and burnout can just as well happen

00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:02,749
on a Rust project as it does on any other project.

00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,249
Burnout is something that affects us all, and I feel that as a community we need to

00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:11,419
talk about it because it's important.

00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:16,740
These issues aren't going away.

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:23,749
So I submitted this talk because I just generally saw how conversations about burnout went down

00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:30,149
most of the time but it's the larger context in which this happens which I find concerning.

00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:34,679
The tech industry has a burnout problem, I do have some charts in a second, and it feels

00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,760
like most people in it are grasping at straws as to why it's happening or what we need to

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,619
do to stop it.

00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:48,509
I will say that finding actual numbers, solid numbers on how many people in the tech industry

00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,779
are burnt out is incredibly difficult.

00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:58,000
I could find numbers that were more representative of the entire workforce, but I'm not sure

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,210
how much you can actually extrapolate from that.

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,499
There's a lot of numbers on - or there's a lot of data on studying the effects of burnout

00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:11,960
on people, so take - I guess this is like a single source of they are fucked up but

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:21,409
even if you apply a margin of error over half is not a great number.

00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:26,470
Interestingly enough, from the same set of data and the same sources and the same sort

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,210
of methodology, this chart emerged.

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,500
It doesn't say in the picture but if you do a reverse image search you will find the same

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,679
article that linked the first one.

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:43,019
It's really interesting that rates of burnout in the UK versus the US versus the rest of

00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,759
mainland Europe, it's not something I would have expected.

00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:50,210
I will say that.

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,549
So what now?

00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:57,611
Say that you are a team lead at Foo Ltd and you want to take this issue seriously, but

00:19:57,611 --> 00:19:59,019
you don't know what to do.

00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:02,760
You go on the Internet, you find some ideas and follow some popular discourse on what

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,489
to do to help your colleagues or employees with their struggles.

00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:09,450
A lot of the discussion is about a 40-hour work week.

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,979
This seems to be largely an artefact of US tech companies branding themselves as progressive

00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:21,570
for not having a 60-hour work week and explaining how much free time you have in such a model.

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:29,179
In Germany a 60-hour work week would be illegal because there's such a thing as labour law,

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:33,559
yet there are startups in Berlin right now that advertise their 40-hour work week as

00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,840
progressive and generous to workers.

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,239
Another proposed mechanism is to make the office more friendly, add a ping-pong table

00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:49,289
or a Nintendo 64 emulator, and noncommittal statements like: why don't we just try chilling

00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:55,080
it with the deadlines, or have you tried not being in so many meetings?

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,119
I feel that these conclusions are unsurprising considering the lens through which the analysis

00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,859
of burnout is happening.

00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:08,059
Your focus or the focus of these techniques is on the productivity of a company.

00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,559
Think of your KPIs, not the mental health of your employees.

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,499
Actual solutions to burnout would include things like switching to a four-day work week

00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:20,950
or even putting someone on several months of paid leave to recover, the same way that

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:26,909
they would be allowed to recover if they had a severe physical injury.

00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:31,479
So if we know that there's good approaches for aiding people recover from burnout, why

00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:34,309
aren't these things that companies are proposing?

00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:39,039
Wouldn't you as a stakeholder in Foo Ltd also gain from keeping your workers healthy and

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,039
productive?

00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:45,159
What we end up with, or what we end up getting are these fake solutions that make sure that

00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,710
people's recovery from burnout is always grounded in the office environment.

00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,739
You are allowed to recover from burnout but please think about work in the meantime.

00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:59,409
Solutions that have been shown to work, like the ones that I just mentioned, but are expensive

00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:01,249
are often not considered.

00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:02,759
Also this screenshot is from a paper.

00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:05,590
There is a link in my speaker notes, please read it.

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,590
It's amazing.

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:12,591
There is a wider trend in our culture of seeking solutions that make everybody happy, sometimes

00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:13,830
called a win-win.

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:20,409
It frames our ability to facilitate change as a quest to a solution that benefits those

00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:23,149
who need help as well as those who don't.

00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:29,769
You are allowed to address A but I as a stakeholder in Foo Ltd also need to benefit with B, is

00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:32,429
essentially how the conversation is framed.

00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:37,080
So discussions about burnout turn into conversations about productivity.

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,539
Discussions about technical debt turn into conversations about productivity.

00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:45,169
This happens because the stakeholders of companies have a vested interest in letting the conversation

00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:49,230
go down this route, but there's a common thread here.

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:54,610
When the stakeholders of an organisation make decisions, people will end up in situations

00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,679
where they burn out, regardless of how well intentioned they thought to have been.

00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,369
By being disconnected from the reality their conditions exist in, people will burn out.

00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:08,460
Analysis done through this framework is inevitably lacking and will fail to describe why these

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,940
things are happening and keep happening, even though we know why.

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,059
It's a work week that's way too long, deadlines that get made by people who are too detached

00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:23,120
from both how much work something is as well as not having to do that work.

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,309
Changing requirements, technical debt that already exists and keeps piling on, adding

00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:33,690
more stress to the people who need to work with these systems every day, and these things

00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,389
will keep happening as long as we don't fundamentally change the way that we work and can relate

00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:40,880
to it.

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,539
So what are the alternatives?

00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:48,860
What if the stakeholders of a company were the people doing work?

00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,289
What if you remove management from the equation, let workers take control of their work?

00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:59,529
When I say take control, I don't mean require little oversight, I mean something much more

00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:02,599
essential.

00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:06,729
You might think that you are being overpaid in your cushy tech job but even your high

00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:14,649
five or six-figure salary is nothing in comparison to what someone in upper management makes

00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:18,659
and they hold power over you and your life that you will never have.

00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:24,229
When I say "take control over your work", I don't mean you personally either.

00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,809
Get connected with your colleagues.

00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,039
Together you are stronger than you could ever be alone.

00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:33,019
You might think that your company needs you, but it's also exploiting you, so fight back

00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:39,450
against that and honestly unions are a great tool to achieve this.

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,820
Working without bosses isn't entirely easy either.

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,049
It requires organisational structures and it requires everybody involved in a team or

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:50,870
company to understand the relationships between the work that is being done and how power

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,469
dynamics factor into the decisions that get made.

00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:58,649
When you work under a management, the power dynamic is very explicit.

00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:00,440
Your boss has power over you.

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,389
In a way removing management from the equation means being better able to understand your

00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:09,549
role in group dynamics and how you relate to the work that you want to do.

00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:14,719
Lastly, and this is I think maybe the most important point that I want you all to take

00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:20,630
home, when we talk about burnout, can you please stop mentioning productivity?

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,799
How often did you - and actually think about this - how often have you thought in these

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,149
terms when you've thought about someone burning out, if you thought about burnout being an

00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:34,460
issue in the tech industry, did you think about it being a danger to the bottom line?

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,349
And how often in recent times have you legitimately thought that a win-win is something that actually

00:25:39,349 --> 00:25:46,509
exists, where you can help someone and then you also get help, or however that is supposed

00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:47,759
to work.

00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,889
None of the issues that I talked about exist in a vacuum and you will find that once you

00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:56,690
accept that we are dealing with a larger social issue, that really only manifests in our little

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:02,039
bubble of society in very particular ways, the world will look very different to you

00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,450
as a result.

00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,960
Thank you very much, and I hope you enjoy the workshops today.

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,100
