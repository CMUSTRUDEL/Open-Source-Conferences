Title: RustFest Barcelona - Neville Dipale: Powering Crowd-sourcing of Public Transit Delays with Rust
Publication date: 2019-11-28
Playlist: RustFest Barcelona 2019
Description: 
	“Your train is arriving in between 20 to 90 minutes”. This is a reality for about 3 million train commuters in South Africa, who not only battle to commute daily, but are faced with a lack of accurate information and high uncertainty about their trains.

This talk explores how we progressively use Rust to power crowd-sourcing of train delays, and are helping reduce the uncertainty of arrival times in our ailing train (and bus) services; all with little computing resources.

We focus on how the Rust language and ecosystem helps us to create tools and services that run at scale and low cost.
