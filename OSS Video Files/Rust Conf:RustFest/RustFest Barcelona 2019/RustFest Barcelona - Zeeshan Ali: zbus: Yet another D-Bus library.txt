Title: RustFest Barcelona - Zeeshan Ali: zbus: Yet another D-Bus library
Publication date: 2019-11-26
Playlist: RustFest Barcelona 2019
Description: 
	In this talk, I will present zbus, a D-Bus crate written from scratch. D-Bus is an inter-process communication mechanism, available and used on almost all modern Linux desktops and many embedded systems. I will start with why I felt the need to take this huge undertaking on my shoulders, followed by the design goals, the challenges faced and how I overcame them during the development.
