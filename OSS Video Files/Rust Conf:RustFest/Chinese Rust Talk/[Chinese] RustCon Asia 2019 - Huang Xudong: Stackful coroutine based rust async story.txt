Title: [Chinese] RustCon Asia 2019 - Huang Xudong: Stackful coroutine based rust async story
Publication date: 2019-05-01
Playlist: Chinese Rust Talk
Description: 
	While the official future based asynchronous system is under way of building and maturing, I’d like to talk about another asynchronous story that based on stackful generators and coroutines.

I’m the author of May(https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may). I could talk the designs and implementations of it, give some fundamental concept about generator and coroutine, the overall structure of coroutine scheduling, the sub IO system, the sub sync preemptive system, the cancellation mechanism, and and compare it with current future based systems
