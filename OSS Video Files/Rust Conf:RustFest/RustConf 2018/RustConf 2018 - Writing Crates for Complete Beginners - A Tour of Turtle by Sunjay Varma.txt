	RustConf 2018 - Writing Crates for Complete Beginners - A Tour of Turtle by Sunjay Varma

Turtle is a Rust graphics crate for creating animated drawings. It is designed to be used to teach programming to complete beginners using Rust. In this talk, you'll learn the inner workings of turtle. We'll show you how we managed to create a library that is both full of features and very easy to learn. We'll go deep into how turtle works and tell you the key aspects of creating a crate that is accessible for anyone of any skill level. You'll leave with new ideas for your own crates and a good understanding of what went into making turtle so beginner friendly.
