	RustConf 2018 - Using Raft in Rust by Siddon Tang

The Raft consensus algorithm has been widely adopted in many companies to build a consistent distributed services that are highly available. This topic is about how we implemented Raft in rust to support TiKV, an open-Source distributed transactional Key-Value store. In this topic, I will first give a brief introduction about Raft, and then talk about our Raft implementation in Rust, and in the end, I will show you how to use Raft in Rust to build a simple distributed Key-Value database.
