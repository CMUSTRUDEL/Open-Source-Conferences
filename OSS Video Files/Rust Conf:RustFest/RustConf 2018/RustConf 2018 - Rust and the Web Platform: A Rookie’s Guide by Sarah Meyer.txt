	RustConf 2018 - Rust and the Web Platform: A Rookie’s Guide by Sarah Meyer

Have you heard the good news about WebAssembly? Since the unlamented demise of Flash, the only choice for writing web applications has been everyone's favorite punching bag of a programming language: JavaScript. WebAssembly defines a new binary format for code that can run natively from all major browsers. The best part is that you can write WebAssembly code in Rust to benefit from Rust's performance and safety guarantees in a place that's never seen them before: the web! Come find out how to get started on your own WebAssembly modules, and contribute to making the web platform a more powerful, useful tool than ever before.

[Music]

00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,869
hey guys thank you so much for coming to

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,270
rest conf

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,710
and to this talk today I'd like to start

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,500
by thanking the organizers for inviting

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,900
me this is actually my second rust

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,910
conference period I was at rest fest at

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,660
the beginning of the summer and I'm

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,180
really enjoying the community so this is

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,500
a talk about the web oh this is me I

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,610
have a name I do so what makes the web

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,710
work what makes it something that is so

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,650
useful to so many people well there's a

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,809
number of aspects one of them is that we

00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,059
have anyone can get if you have the

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,610
internet anyone can get on it so there's

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,170
sort of an equality of access we have

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,890
cool stuff like universal resource

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,589
locators that mean anything has a

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,590
defined address and finally there's

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:11,760
something really cool which is hypertext

00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:14,400
now a hypertext kind of to me reminds me

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,890
of the long efforts that people have

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,990
made to cite other texts in their works

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,960
and traditionally the way that you would

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,880
do this is with a quotation most like

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,410
works of famous literature especially

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,450
when there were not many works of famous

00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,490
literature we're so well known that you

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,070
could just use the same words and have

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,170
that be a sort of accepted method of

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,990
referring to another work and calling in

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:40,830
all of its of all of its echoes into

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,690
your own later you know as there got to

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,200
be much more literature in the world and

00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:48,290
we needed a more rational method of

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,390
organizing it we developed the citation

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,130
but hypertext was something a little bit

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,060
different what did hypertext give us

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:59,100
that's different from earlier

00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:02,040
technologies instant gratification so

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,140
rather than having to look up a citation

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,060
you know perhaps a very lengthy period

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,000
you could go from document to document

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,659
as fast as your internet speed would

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,750
allow so who is it that we have to thank

00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:18,510
for this miracle it is our favorite

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,879
gentleman Tim berners-lee I would like

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,980
to thank him for so much most of all the

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,980
Internet and the web

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,989
we all know and love but also for just

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,769
being a very unproblematic man for about

00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,290
thirty years

00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:32,150
he's like an Anglican vicar he's

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,849
involved in charity he's been married to

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,129
the same woman for like 22 years

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:43,099
seriously we stand an unproblematic King

00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:45,349
so this slightly minimized screenshot

00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:48,709
perhaps he may recognize it this is

00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:51,829
famously the first page of the web and

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:54,319
those beautiful little blue links are

00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:56,420
the only form of interactivity on this

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,060
document they are the only thing that

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:03,079
you can do with this document which is

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:07,849
great and all but so HTML came out in

00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:10,540
1993 and I most immediately the quest

00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:13,400
began to make the web interactive

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,220
basically these this this instant

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,790
gratification of having all the content

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,220
linked from one document to another made

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,890
people start wishing they could do more

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,049
things with these documents made people

00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:31,489
want to expand the capabilities of what

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:34,069
they were looking at and of course the

00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:36,620
people who wrote HTML are not

00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:39,530
necessarily the ones who began this job

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,470
of trying to make web pages interactive

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:46,099
Tim berners-lee was a physicist working

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:48,380
for CERN he dr. the document model was

00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:50,540
something that probably was enough for

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,709
him for a while but not for a lot of

00:03:50,540 --> 00:04:00,109
Internet users so this also quite quite

00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:03,049
small screenshot is of a Java applet so

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:05,269
Java applets oh man

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,980
they came out so early they were

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:10,250
released with the first version of Java

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,650
because like Java even though we think

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,109
of it as a like systems and like

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,400
back-end programming language always was

00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:20,329
trying to kind of bridge this gap

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,709
between the server and the client so one

00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,060
of the cool things about Java applets

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,650
what they was that they were deliberate

00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,530
is Java bytecode so they were quite

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,940
small in terms of download size well of

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,190
course that does depend on whether you

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,729
actually had Java already installed to

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,529
your machine you might have a very

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:36,969
hefty download in between you and

00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:39,249
whatever piece of content you were

00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:42,400
looking at so that's one of the like

00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:45,520
slightly less user-friendly aspects of

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,129
Java applets but there were some aspects

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,960
that were really really nice Java code

00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:52,150
obviously could run on any machine that

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,639
ran Java and what was the the Brad about

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,199
like 1 billion devices running Java in

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,029
2000 something

00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,650
well even back then there were a lot of

00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:02,939
lot of devices running Java it was a

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,689
solid option for that cross-platform

00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,120
interoperability that we're always

00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:08,050
chasing as developers you know you want

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,819
to write it once and have it work

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:15,990
everywhere it also was very fast just

00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:18,490
Lake until JavaScript started getting

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,819
optimized for performance in a variety

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:24,669
of ways at the beginning of this decade

00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:30,069
it was just a faster option to run

00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:34,029
interactive programs in the browser but

00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:37,629
it was not the only option available for

00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:42,099
long this is like what I found when I

00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:43,839
googled JavaScript in 1996 it's just a

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:47,319
little script tag there

00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:50,249
so JavaScript of course has an origin

00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:56,050
story that is famous or perhaps

00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:58,360
notorious to us all so Java was

00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,860
instantly becoming very popular almost

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,689
from the moment of its release because

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,139
it was filling a need that many

00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:06,939
developers had both to have relatively

00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:09,249
accessible server-side programming and

00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:12,789
to again bridge that gap between server

00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:17,169
and client this concept was gathering so

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:19,319
much steam that Netscape which had was

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:23,020
trying to release its mosaic killer

00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,339
Mozilla a browser at the time and

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,479
somebody's gonna get my I'm gonna get my

00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:27,520
facts wrong somewhere in here and

00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,080
somebody is gonna have direct personal

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,219
experience in this audience I know it

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,629
but there was so much urgency that a

00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:37,839
Brendan Eich famously wrote this

00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:41,999
prototype in ten days so we wound up

00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:46,199
getting JavaScript released by the end

00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:48,479
of 1995 so basically shortly after the

00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,189
release of Java it was not called

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,279
JavaScript at first I think that was

00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:55,139
like a slightly later version that they

00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,489
you know of course they called it

00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,459
JavaScript to kind of hang on to those

00:06:56,489 --> 00:07:01,110
coattails of Java to this day confusing

00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,899
people who are very smart like my mother

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,449
you know she's really smart but she just

00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,099
can't remember that one one of the other

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:10,709
interesting things about JavaScript is

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:13,409
that unlike Java which was sort of a

00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:15,389
general use programming language with

00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:18,329
sort of an API for putting up like

00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:21,719
applications javascript was designed

00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:24,119
from the ground up with the with HTML in

00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:27,119
mind javascript was designed to

00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:29,729
manipulate HTML and that I think is an

00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:31,559
important aspect to its later success

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,969
another important aspect to its later

00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:35,969
success was how much people started

00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:38,189
trying to copy it like this was an era

00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:40,289
of like all proprietary code

00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:41,759
nobody was sharing their code well maybe

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:45,769
not nobody but none of these people were

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:50,789
sharing their code so for Microsoft to

00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:53,129
actually get a their own JavaScript

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,479
version up they basically just looked at

00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:56,309
what was running in Netscape browsers

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,879
and copied it and re-implemented it with

00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:02,279
their own engineers which is like very

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:07,199
1996 but also kind of a crappy way to

00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:10,169
work but then we have oh god most

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,239
blessed there's one other very popular

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:17,329
option for interactivity on the web and

00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:20,989
it is flash this is an old flash website

00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:24,360
so flash came out almost right after

00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:26,939
JavaScript they are like on each other's

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,249
heels because clearly this is the

00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,509
movement this is what people want out of

00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:34,919
this brand-new technology called the web

00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:36,509
so one of the cool things that I found

00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,279
out when I was researching this talk is

00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:40,649
that flash was actually developed by a

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,870
it was called futuresplash which I guess

00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:44,910
became flash and this is about that a

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,439
company called futurewave that was

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,660
clearly chasing every trend in the

00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:51,660
computing space because they had started

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,370
out making like pen pen vector drawing

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:58,660
computers because pen computers were the

00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:02,680
 of 1993 but they were not the hot

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:05,380
 of like 1994 or 1995 so basically

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,360
this company took this Lake animation

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,400
studio that they had developed and they

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,320
took the viewer for it which in a very

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,390
fortunate development for them was very

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,390
lightweight and could easily be bundled

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:19,180
up and delivered as an extension to web

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,010
browsers so this and the fact that it

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,350
flash had an amazingly accessible

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,779
toolkit because again it hadn't been

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,330
originally developed for like technical

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:29,560
users coders as opposed to the earlier

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,900
technologies that we're talking about

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,060
which while they were relatively user

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,430
friendly scripting languages still had

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,630
that barrier of assuming that somebody

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,560
knew how to code before they started

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:45,250
using them so flash really became a

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:48,279
colossal success until of course Steve

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:52,870
Jobs killed it with the iPhone because

00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:54,580
the iPhone 1 and flash when it not

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,060
supported darling iPhone could not

00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,130
succeed this is despite some very

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,070
legitimate attempts that flash made to

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,230
converge back into the JavaScript

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:09,220
standard with something like action

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:12,670
script which was a implementation of I

00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,980
think an early ECMO script spec but they

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:19,120
never brought them back together and

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:21,520
flash unfortunately died or did it this

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,910
is a screenshot I took like yesterday

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,640
from a paper doll game that was released

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:30,640
about three weeks ago

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,330
flash still has an incredibly active and

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,160
a passionate user base and community

00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,230
it just doesn't include any of the

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,320
people who probably are first on your

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,750
mind when you think of Internet users

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,870
but there are still like children and

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,670
artists and people who have just

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,980
developed a lot of skills in this area

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,980
who are unwilling to let go of this

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,920
proprietary format and to me the fact

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,440
that like flash has this community Java

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,270
applets don't even though they both

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,400
represent sort of proprietary formats

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,950
really speaks to me how much success

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,580
Java flash

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:10,050
is accessible tools gave it and I think

00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,120
there's a lesson there for all of us

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,990
about keeping our tools as accessible as

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,230
as we can within reason that I think is

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:23,190
the way that most projects find success

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:26,970
so all of this together was the birth of

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:29,280
the web platform because these competing

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,860
visions of what interactivity on the web

00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,380
was going to look like ignited of what

00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,290
we call the browser wars and this was

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:41,220
basically a like triangular conflict

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:44,550
between browser vendors browser users

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,440
and application developers the browser

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,360
vendors wanted to offer features that

00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,010
would be so attractive to the users that

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,900
they would choose their browser and not

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,730
somebody else's but application

00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,810
developers wanted their programs to run

00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:01,620
on every browser with the same behavior

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:04,560
this conflict eventually led to the

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,240
creation of atma script which is not in

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,270
itself a language so much as it is a

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,740
specification for a language and

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,570
basically Eknath script was developed by

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,130
looking at all the disparate JavaScript

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,910
implementations that existed at the time

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:22,110
and trying to find the commonalities in

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:24,000
them so that they could be defined so

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,470
that anyone could use them so that in

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,860
the future if somebody were coming up

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,480
with a new browser they wouldn't have to

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,460
just like kind of feel out how

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,860
JavaScript is supposed to work they

00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,100
could actually know how it's supposed to

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,770
work

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,300
defined standards that if they meet they

00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,490
know that they're offering a good

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:46,170
experience both to developers and to

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:49,560
users so that said though this birth was

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,790
much less like this and much more like

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,180
this

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,670
Saturn eating his own children it was a

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,130
brutal conflict red in tooth and nail

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,580
and as we all know there were casualties

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:06,030
like Netscape but there were also huge

00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:09,390
wins for the community this open source

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:12,360
governance model was so successful with

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:14,550
JavaScript that that for that reason and

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,220
for other reasons it began to be the

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,030
accepted way of developing software that

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,830
you wanted a wide

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,300
variety of people to use this was an era

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,750
of increasing standardization

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:28,640
both with like IETF standards for like

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:31,230
web and Internet technologies and for a

00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,150
standardization of stuff like the w3c

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,850
was actually predates the browser Wars

00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:39,330
slightly because it existed to

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,290
standardize HTML even before anyone was

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:46,940
thinking of trying to standardize

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:49,920
javascript so javascript has one right

00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:54,030
nobody out here is writing Java applets

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,950
seriously to my knowledge and flash well

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,770
we've established that people are still

00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,930
using it quite actively it is obviously

00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,990
deprecated by all the major browser

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,940
vendors and has no support on the mobile

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:09,680
devices that we consider to be so

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,940
important in this day and age but God

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,290
JavaScript man I've been writing

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,510
JavaScript for like five and a half

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,510
years now people pay me to do it and

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:21,060
everything and it's fun a lot of the

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,760
time it's fun because of how close

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,400
JavaScript is to me anytime I want to I

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,710
can just open up a terminal and there's

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,380
my repple wow that's that's pretty neat

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,180
that's pretty easy but there are other

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,850
aspects of the JavaScript experience

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,190
that are not so good performance of

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,290
course is one of them javascript is a

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,020
scripting language it has to run inside

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:47,490
like a small subset of your computer's

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:49,470
resources and while browser vendors are

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,020
always trying to optimize for the way

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,580
that people write JavaScript this does

00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,310
create a sort of situation where there's

00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:59,550
a bit of tail chasing JavaScript vendors

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:02,880
optimise common patterns and then kind

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,760
of institutionalize what might or might

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,560
not be good programming behavior so many

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,710
people don't want to write JavaScript

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,080
but on the other hand the web seems to

00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:16,140
have one more and more applications that

00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,030
in a previous era would have been would

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,740
have been native applications perhaps on

00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:23,400
your desktop computer are now web

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,910
applications so what's a person to do if

00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,970
they want to write performance code that

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,579
runs like native perhaps with all of the

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,199
other

00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:33,910
all the futures that JavaScript notably

00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:37,540
lacks like any kind of internal

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:39,610
coherence well

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,170
people started feeling out this problem

00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,059
almost immediately

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,709
JavaScript of course has not been

00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:46,420
popular among large swaths of the

00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:48,759
community so one of the original

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,559
solutions that people came up with was

00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:53,589
Assam Jas

00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:56,230
Asmodeus basically took advantage of a

00:15:53,589 --> 00:16:01,480
number of like performance hacks of

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:04,420
JavaScript stuff like doing 8du adding

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,759
bitwise operators to all of the integers

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,369
he were using in JavaScript code which

00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:12,670
was a hack that would make them be

00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:14,829
treated like more like native data

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,049
structures than like JavaScript data

00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:19,269
structures so what Adam today is

00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:20,259
basically was though was kind of hack

00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,449
for people who didn't want to write

00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:25,629
JavaScript to not write JavaScript they

00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:29,139
would write C or C++ or maybe even rust

00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:32,649
actually because those timelines do sort

00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:33,939
of overlap and just run a compilation

00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,519
step on it that would turn it into

00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:38,110
JavaScript that boasted native

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:42,629
performance owing to how it was

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:46,059
optimized but that was not the only

00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:48,279
proposal for getting native level of

00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:50,230
performance in a seamless way in web

00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,929
browsers there was also the Google

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,720
Native Client which was abbreviated as

00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:58,149
NaCl like salt so there were a lot of

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,269
pretty bad pepper jokes like salt and

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:05,230
pepper for their project names bless all

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:07,809
Google employees so this actually is

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,740
like quite an old project 2011 I don't

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:12,909
know I feel like that was forever ago

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,769
like I was I was a young man and this

00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:17,289
was a chrome only solution not

00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:20,470
shockingly because it was a proprietor a

00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:24,519
busy it wasn't a proprietary Google

00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:28,329
product exactly but to quote somebody

00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:30,580
from Mozilla in like 2012 it was an open

00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:33,760
specification open specification beyond

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:37,929
its chrome implementation so there was

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,600
basically no way that people were going

00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:44,360
to really adopt Google Native Client

00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,040
unless chrome became the only browser

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,290
people used and that is not what

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,080
happened we actually exist in a

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:54,110
relatively stable and pleasant situation

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,510
of a variety of browsers competing quite

00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,580
fiercely against each other but

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,770
fortunately for users in a much safer

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,549
and more satisfying way than in the late

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,350
90s and part of that I think is because

00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:09,740
we have technologies like this next one

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,630
web assembly so web assembly actually

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,250
comes directly from the same open

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,770
governance structures that were

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:19,460
established to govern JavaScript at the

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:23,030
end if the browser worse so it is again

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:27,140
defined as a specification as a standard

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:29,570
and basically it defines two formats one

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,400
of which is like just binary I can't

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,080
read it or make sense of it you probably

00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,900
can't either no matter how good your

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,169
brain is and then the other one is a

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,840
more comprehensive and maybe kind of

00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:46,460
human readable and editable assembly

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:49,100
like format which you can hand edit if

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,780
you would so choose but that's probably

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,780
not what you want to do you probably

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:57,049
want to write code in something like C

00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:01,280
C++ Ruby no not Ruby why don't I just

00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:02,690
say that I'm entrust and it was

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,230
initially the initial features were

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:09,830
based on the as MJS feature set so again

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:12,410
this kind of model of looking at what

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,809
exists out there implementing all of its

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,000
features and then trying to supersede it

00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:18,440
which we see again and again you know in

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,940
computing that's how we work we want to

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,669
make something better and then we want

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,049
to make it much better we want to extend

00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:26,720
what it does beyond what was already

00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:29,480
possible so web assembly is so brand

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,000
spanking new it was announced in 2015 we

00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,490
had a first like unity demo in 2016 and

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,130
the initial release was already in 2017

00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:40,540
so that was like last year and now here

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:43,340
we are in the middle of this year it is

00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,799
actually just blowing up in terms of

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,450
like interest I was at rest fest at the

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:51,710
beginning of the summer and somebody did

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:53,870
a talk on you a I think it's still not

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,750
quite production ready but the mere

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,480
notion that you can have

00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:01,000
now a web framework where you write both

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,970
a server-side and client-side code in

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,970
the same in the same language and then

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,710
have it compiled into JavaScript wow

00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,890
that is so neat I have been a web

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,860
developer for so long one of the things

00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,780
that we are only is chasing is

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:19,270
isomorphism this notion that we could

00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:22,419
have code that will run the same both on

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:24,580
the browser and on the server and why

00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:26,500
would you want this well every time I

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,690
write something like a forum validation

00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,799
that's logic that I have to duplicate

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:37,419
both in my JavaScript and in my Python

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:39,820
Ruby rust Java go well that frankly

00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:43,480
sucks first of all the person writing

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:45,250
the Python Ruby Rusco might very well

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,500
not be the same person who writes that

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,520
javascript and they will certainly

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,270
probably not be the same people

00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:55,570
maintaining it it is just as we if you

00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,659
saw Isis and Chelsea's talk earlier

00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,820
about trying to maintain parity between

00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:03,370
rust and C implementations of a complex

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,200
bit of logic no matter how many smart

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,039
engineers you have it probably just

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,380
can't be done

00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:13,000
so having code that is truly the same

00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,940
that runs the same with the same

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,250
assumptions is something that I have

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,580
been interested in for a long time and I

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,780
sort of I taste it coming with

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:27,490
webassembly

00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:29,640
it's so close um and there's some tools

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:33,370
I want to call out especially in the

00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:36,130
rust community one of them is Waze and

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,799
bind gen which is what we use to sort of

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:44,380
pass functions and data structures over

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:47,650
that rust webassembly border and then we

00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:51,100
have Waze and PAC which is an incredibly

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:55,090
cool tool that lets you package up rust

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:58,720
as NPM modules so you can have your rest

00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:01,500
code running in a browser extremely

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,929
easily with a minimum set up from you so

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,910
now this brings us this brings us to me

00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:09,510
actually

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:12,360
Tommy that's Ashley but I'm here because

00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,860
of Ashley because Ashley tweeted at the

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,080
beginning of the summer about a program

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,090
called rust reach which is basically

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,250
intended to give people who were not

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,310
currently involved in rust some

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,570
mentorship a project to work on and try

00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:29,120
to get them more involved in the rest

00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:32,010
community one as we've reviewed the

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,510
success of a language is defined by how

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,570
many people are interested in using it

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,650
and how many people find it easy to use

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:42,360
so one of the great things that's built

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:44,550
into rust is trying to both treasure the

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,380
human element and take out the

00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,360
importance of any one individual

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,760
contributor so that projects are more

00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,110
sustainable for a long time like in

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,300
Python that just this last year we have

00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:56,700
a big maintainer step down because of

00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,430
the exhaustion that is involved in

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,100
working on these projects so long and so

00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,840
hard with so little reward so the

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,990
broader a base of people that we get

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,970
into this rust and webassembly community

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,740
the more likely that this standard is

00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,070
going to be successful because it hasn't

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,070
won yet

00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:19,200
so the this so tiny screenshot um is

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,270
just a couple of my friends from rust

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,920
reach having our weekly call where we

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,960
talk about our projects and what we were

00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:30,930
working on one of those people is in the

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:33,330
audience crystal girl and I just want to

00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:36,090
say that this experience was incredibly

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,980
important to me because like I said I've

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,200
been a web developer for like almost six

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,090
years now I never thought that

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,130
systems-level programming was something

00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,050
that I could do not because I didn't

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,000
think I had the brains for it or

00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,890
something but just because I was out of

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,570
college where was I gonna get that kind

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:55,970
of training was I gonna go back to

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:59,340
school just to learn assembly no but

00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:02,580
rust was kind of here when I needed it

00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:05,730
and rust was welcoming to me when I

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,470
needed it to be welcoming and there is

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,200
so much that I have learned just about

00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,930
how computers really work from this last

00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,030
summer's experience of working on with

00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,500
rust it's

00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,590
like a whole new computer science

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:24,450
education for somebody who really missed

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:25,950
that experience in college so I also

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,230
want to talk again a little bit about

00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,350
those tools that we have in rust and

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:34,200
webassembly and I want to shout out to

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:36,270
Nick Fitzgerald Fitz John who is really

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,490
a leader and the rest was a working

00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:41,040
group and has also been very personally

00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:43,650
welcoming to me and to my contributions

00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,880
on these projects basically all I've

00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,060
been doing so far is a little bit of

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,370
documentation here and there but despite

00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:52,950
that nobody expected me to come in with

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,900
like some great ground baked breaking PR

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,190
and I wouldn't be accepted unless I

00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,350
refactored the whole language on my

00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,500
first day which definitely was always my

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,920
fear with OSS but it wasn't the case at

00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,630
least in this community people were

00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,610
encouraged me to ramp up slowly and gave

00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:12,240
me the space I needed to get comfortable

00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:15,350
with what I was looking at so that also

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,300
means that I started working on

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:21,180
something we call the the game of life

00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,890
tutorial in brest wasum now the game of

00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:26,390
life Conway's Game of Life if you're

00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:29,130
familiar with it is a fun sort of

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,940
computational game with simple rules as

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:35,280
you can see we have a grid with cells

00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:37,080
the rule is that any cell with two or

00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,760
three neighbors any live cells two with

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,200
your neighbors survives if it has a

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,510
different number of live neighbors it

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,610
dies and a dead cell with exactly three

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,860
neighbors will become alive so this is

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,170
something that you can run at every step

00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,610
and depending on the size of the grid it

00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:53,250
can become quite computationally

00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:57,540
intensive which makes it a very fun test

00:25:53,250 --> 00:26:01,110
case for wasum now it is such an

00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:03,920
interesting test case that can anyone

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,920
read this is it too small

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,900
yeah so I had a different computer up

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,450
until like two years ago this is a

00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,750
little 2011 MacBook Air that's doing its

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:20,000
utmost with its four gigs of ram I

00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:23,570
cannot actually compile the upper levels

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,610
of the game of life on my computer which

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,960
is a really fun cool problem that has

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,180
prevented me from doing the live demo

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,150
that I wanted to do at this talk but I

00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,320
think you guys will forgive me right

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:38,000
thank you thank you I really appreciate

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:40,750
it so that kind of brings me to another

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,090
project I worked on which was just to

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:49,160
automatically generate read nice for the

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:51,230
exported typescript files that are

00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,060
generated when you run some rest code

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,620
through Waze and PAC and I'm still

00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,530
working on that I learned a lot about

00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,590
Nam and like parsing in rust and it's a

00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:01,940
real joy but like multi multiple

00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:04,910
functions in one file aren't working

00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:07,250
right now it's okay it's okay

00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,290
we'll keep working on it and for that I

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,970
actually want to really thank my friend

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,590
Michael Cato let's see who worked with

00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,920
me on that project and he was my mentor

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:19,580
throughout rust reach because again he

00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,160
really did the work of letting me know

00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:26,720
that I could do this and helping me with

00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:29,570
it in a very empowering way so this

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,220
might be familiar to you it was linked

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,110
from the very bottom of that screenshot

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:36,280
I showed you earlier this is the

00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:40,130
original how can I help page of the web

00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:43,520
because Tim berners-lee baked that in to

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,710
that first web page this call for

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,330
contributions this call for help this

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,670
call for contribute

00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:52,250
for making things better than they are

00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:54,680
right now and that's the exact same

00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,840
thing we need right now with rust and

00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,980
webassembly we're getting more and where

00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,650
users we're getting more and more

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,660
interest but we need still more people

00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,730
so we can solve things like this problem

00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,660
and where I can't compile on a machine

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,660
before gigabytes

00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:11,170
like that's solvable maybe I can't solve

00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,940
it but I think maybe one if you can and

00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:15,080
that is the thing that keeps me so

00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,380
endlessly

00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,870
excited about technology the internet

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,940
and the web there is always someone out

00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,679
there who wants to solve your problem

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,419
maybe they can solve it better than you

00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,159
ever could have thought of doing it but

00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:29,830
you don't know until you reach them you

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,330
don't know until you convince them that

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:36,289
helping out is in their interests as

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:38,510
well as yours and that instinct to

00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:41,029
improve the tools that we have in a way

00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:43,760
that is helpful to everyone around us is

00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:45,890
what has really built the internet that

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,220
we know and love and that I think has

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:52,519
brought us all together here today so

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,700
I'm really grateful to the people who

00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,080
have worked on all the technologies that

00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:01,730
support the technologies that I write

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,860
now because it has taken it has taken

00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,260
not just a village but an entire world

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:08,059
of programmers years and years to get to

00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,889
this point that we are we all stand on

00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:11,389
the shoulders of giants and I'm like

00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:15,440
literally looking at some of my Giants

00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:17,990

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,789
