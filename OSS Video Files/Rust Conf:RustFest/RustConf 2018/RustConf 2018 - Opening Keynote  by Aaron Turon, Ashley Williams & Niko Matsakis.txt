[Music]

00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:22,020
hey everybody hello welcome again to

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,390
ruskov 2018 I am loving this because I

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,060
live here in Portland and basically this

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,060
is 300 of my best friends or soon to be

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,059
best friends coming to my hometown I'm

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,280
also super pleased after this is the

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,080
fourth Russ conference that we've held

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,090
starting with Russ camp and this is the

00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,400
first time that we aren't in roundtables

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,750
because there are too many of you so

00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,500
really excited about the conference

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,010
today and so I want to talk a little bit

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,800
about one of the major focuses of this

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,870
year which has been rust 2018 a new

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,699
edition of rust so if you've been paying

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,350
attention to rust at all you probably

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,799
will have heard of this it's basically

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,860
the culmination of those last four years

00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,990
of work you know since rust 1.0 came out

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,030
right so there's a there's a huge list

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,580
of features connected with rust 2018

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,159
obviously we don't have time to talk

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,619
about all of them in depth but I did

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,960
want us you know start talking through

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,850
some of them so there's you know

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,990
features like raw identifiers x' there's

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,040
some clarity visibility modifiers are in

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,840
rust 2018

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,310
you can now nest imports yeah there's a

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,850
question mark operator which you can now

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:39,180
use in the main function you can control

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,590
panics in rust 2018 we've been working

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,160
on async/await it's not actually gonna

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,790
ship in rust 2080 unfortunately but i'ms

00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,050
the brakes yeah there's a we've made

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,890
some improvements to the trait system

00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,310
you might have heard about with

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,590
infiltrate and dine trade there's a

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,970
there's operator equals yeah I don't

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,290
know what that is actually

00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,290
oh yeah I've never used it but

00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:04,299
let's see there's sliced cut urns we've

00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,759
made some changes to ownership in

00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:10,030
lifetime I like that one yeah I know

00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,400
that's that's one really favorites wait

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,780
he was just about I'm sorry that were

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,069
you gonna read how many slides of this

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:20,980
158 just making this list oh my god

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,780
no so hi I'm Ashley and I'm also

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,760
supposed to be giving this talk and I

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:29,110
can't stand idly by and give a keynote

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,769
unless it's about philosophy so it's

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:38,170
time to get philosophical yeah let's do

00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:39,760
that so I'm really this idea of

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,980
genealogy and I think it has a lot to do

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,080
with the addition and so a genealogy

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,850
often attempts to look beyond the

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,400
discourse in question towards the

00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,260
conditions of it's possibility and so

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,330
I've gotten these ideas by reading these

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,730
books so the first one obviously is

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,530
Nietzsche's genealogy of morals followed

00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:01,840
closely by Hegel's phenomenology of

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:04,420
spirit so there's investigations one to

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,500
right I think I think Aaron I mean okay

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,840
because a little maybe a little lost but

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,150
the original idea was pretty good we

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,230
should talk about rust but we can talk

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:16,420
about rust and philosophy right so we

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,519
could talk about the 2018 edition but

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,980
not about the edition itself but about

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,350
what made it possible what do you think

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:27,239
mm-hmm pretty good I think it's good

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,239
it's good right good

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,160
yeah they like it they like it that's

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,310
true alright I'll give it a shot

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,180
so if we're gonna talk philosophy

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,180
obviously the first question is what

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,950
even is rust so at least traditionally

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,310
we talk about rust being a systems

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,830
language and how does a systems language

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,300
get created well we have a whole team

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,820
full of systems programmers yeah but

00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,800
like systems programmers in like a way

00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,070
that you're not imagining I think fright

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:05,050
like systems programmers cuz open-source

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:08,380
is an intricate system of people this is

00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:10,330
a talk about people systems and I mean

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,920
like you just get this right like you

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,810
know that joke about the hardest problem

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,790
in computer science right

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,790
[Laughter]

00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,400
okay this one's pretty good but the one

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,840
I'm mostly I'm talking about is this one

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,460
which is that the hardest problem in

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,660
computer science is actually people and

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:38,610
unfortunately as you probably already

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,620
know people people can be a little

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,180
frustrating but let's not forget we're

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,919
talking about what made the rush 2018

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,780
edition possible and it's all of these

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,759
people here is all of those people who

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,220
are not here it's all of us in the Russ

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,830
community working together right so this

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,870
is what our talk is gonna be about and I

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,979
think we're yeah we're gonna start the

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,919
real talk now so welcome to our talk

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:05,550
about people systems I'm Niko misaki's

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:09,720
I'm Erin and I'm a g-dub's and I don't

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,389
have a mic and I'm gonna kick it off by

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,030
talking about unleashing latent energy

00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,430
meaning basically how can we bring

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,630
together all the and hope to organize

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,220
and channel all the people who are

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,770
excited about rust and make things

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,159
happen in rust right and in open source

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,289
more generally so if we look back to

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,630
when rust first started it's been an

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:33,990
open source project from the beginning

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:36,240
right but initially we didn't have kind

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,240
of a formal governance structure we had

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,949
decisions being made by like graden and

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,090
other people who were involved but there

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,590
wasn't and there were people

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,050
contributing PRS and things but there

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,969
wasn't a lot of structure to it and that

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,030
we changed that around 1.0 when we

00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:53,219
brought in the rust teams and the goal

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,870
here was to fold first off we had this

00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,219
problem that there was just a small set

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,840
of people making all the decisions and

00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:59,250
it was kind of overwhelming and there

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,259
was a blocker like we couldn't make

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,370
enough progress we couldn't scale up but

00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,840
also there were a lot of people who were

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,699
really heavily involved in the project

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,219
who didn't have a formal role and that

00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,479
was unjust and it was a shame and so we

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:12,090
wanted to find a way to bring all of

00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,849
them in and give them control as well as

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,620
scaling the project up I just want to

00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:19,680
point out I wrote that our RFC yeah I

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:24,780
know wherever your name will live in

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,440
glory and since then we've we've made a

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,120
lot of progress

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,479
so the rust teams have started from this

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,610
kind of relatively small set and in the

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,710
last well you can see it for yourself

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,960
this is a graph of the last year

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,880
no vault I'm actually the size of the

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,430
Ruston's but in the last year especially

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,410
you can see there's been a steady climb

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,790
and the number of people involved in Rus

00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,740
governance structure and that's not an

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,750
accident that's the result of sort of

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,140
deliberate engineering of trying to grow

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,000
this structure and make space and create

00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,310
the opportunities for people to step in

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,900
right and I want to tell you a story

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,680
about that and this story has to do with

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,170
Alex Alex are you here somewhere yeah so

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,930
if you if you'd come and said to me

00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,430
maybe a year ago you know can you point

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,410
me at the team that's responsible for

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,500
rusts release process I would say yeah

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,970
there's Alex right over there because he

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,280
in addition to all of his other duties

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,690
doing lots and lots of things he was

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,460
maintaining basically full-time the

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,950
infrastructure ensuring the releases get

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,740
out and it sounds pretty cool alex is

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:29,430
cool but it's also kind of overwhelming

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:33,270
right like he this is too much for one

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,710
person to do and and in a result they

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,600
couldn't get all the things done and we

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,520
wanted to improve the situation and so

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,860
now if we look now at what what we have

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,740
we have a team that manages the release

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,760
process led by mark simulacrum we have a

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,350
separate team managing the

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,850
infrastructure led by Aidan Hopson

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,460
sayers

00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:52,380
and in addition to that we have this

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,910
kind of ever watching team of bots that

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,850
are growing and growing at a fast pace

00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,890
and where did these bots come from well

00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,480
the answer is these bots came from those

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,210
two teams right because now that we have

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,590
actual teams managing this process they

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,030
have enough time to do things like

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,320
automate the processes and make them

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,060
better and not just always be

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,880
just-in-time getting everything done

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,890
right and you can see that also looking

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,330
at like the number of polar crisis this

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,640
is a graph of our pole request status

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,470
showing different how many pull requests

00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,640
and how what state they're in and you

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,740
can see first of all that we have a

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,490
graph that's also something that teams

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,490
managed to pull together

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:33,120
and secondly that we're fielding twice

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,940
as many pull requests as we were so so

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,610
this stuff works but how did this happen

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,260
how do we go from from from Alex to two

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,800
teams neither of which alex is leading

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,870
by the way right also very cool

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,520
so the first there's a couple of steps

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,500
involved right and the first one maybe

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,600
the most obvious one is you need to ask

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,220
for help you need to recognize kind of

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
that this is something that people will

00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,460
help with and that's not always obvious

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,310
like I think that there were a lot of

00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,510
doubts about whether for example release

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,220
management was something that you could

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,960
sort of open you can handle in an open

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,730
source fashion all right not everyone

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,470
believed that and so asking can take a

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,090
lot of forms this was one of the ways

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,040
that we asked in this case Erin posted

00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,400
this comment basically saying hey if

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,990
you'd like to help let me know right

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,910
here's a bunch of people see seed but

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,770
it's not it turns out it's more than

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,680
just asking right there's a right way

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,810
and a wrong way to ask if that was the

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,490
only thing that Erin had done I think it

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:33,870
would still have Alex managing

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:36,110
everything else right but what what came

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,540
before that was a lot of groundwork

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,010
basically laying out figuring out what

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,290
things were blocking people from

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:45,690
participating now and could we correct

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,520
those and giving and figuring out what

00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,190
would be the first few steps that a

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,390
nascent team can take I can we have some

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,770
kind of activities people can get

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,240
together and get the ball rolling and

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,650
once things get going it's usually a lot

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,760
easier because people start coming up

00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,800
with their own ideas of how to improve

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,050
things but the first few steps are

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,730
really hard

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:06,180
yeah and it's a it's a really delicate

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,920
balance you know because you are trying

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,160
to make a space for people to fit into

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,600
but if all you do is open the space then

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,520
people are just kind of floating around

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,350
they don't there's nothing to sort of

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,720
attach themselves to you right so you

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,060
you have to build a little bit of

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,130
structure but leave enough freedom for

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,050
people to find their place in it and I

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,000
think one of the things that we did for

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,580
the infrastructure team to kick it off

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,220
that helped a lot was right off the bat

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,070
we had a task that we could all work

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,720
together on and sort of gel as a team it

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,160
wasn't the most important task in the

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,850
world but it was it was something where

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,380
we could start to build

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,970
poor start to build some momentum and

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,920
then the structure has kind of evolved

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,440
from there yeah exactly

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,180
so I usually call this or I've come to

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,890
call this sort of building a skeleton

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,210
and this skeleton can take a lot of

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,920
forms but the whole idea is you're not

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,290
constructing the whole thing it's just

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,610
enough of it to see the to see how it

00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,780
fits together and where the gaps are

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,380
right so there might be just

00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:05,380
instructions on a pole on an issue kind

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,940
of saying not just I can someone fix

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,110
this but here's a couple places in the

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,940
code you might look here's the rough

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,350
idea how to do it but it might be an

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,870
end-to-end prototype or it might be the

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,980
first few tasks for a team just

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,790
different it takes a lot of different

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,940
shapes and the other thing that's really

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:23,980
important is opening up not just kind of

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,210
the issues to be fixed and so on but

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,620
also the planning and decision-making

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:31,270
itself so doing regular meetings

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,590
especially being a 10th paying attention

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,020
to the fact that people have two

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,210
operating interact a synchronously so

00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,710
these sorts of things and involving

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:43,140
everyone else in decision-making and

00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:46,570
prioritization is really important so

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,580
the last step an important step is don't

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,900
forget to say thank you and to tell

00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,010
everyone what a great job they're doing

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,570
because sometimes we take it a little

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,790
bit for granted that they know how

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,650
awesome we think they are right but

00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:00,250
actually they may not they might like to

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,720
hear it and if you do it all together I

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:06,310
mean to bring this back to this awesome

00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,680
opening slide you know basically you are

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,820
able to do a lot more because you have a

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,680
whole bunch of people working together

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,350
than you would have been able to do by

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:19,990
yourself

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:22,660
but so so this is kind of right and so

00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,400
like basically that previous slide all

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,150
those things came out from the in period

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,970
I don't know how many of you remember

00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,440
the Imperius big first attempts at

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,880
growing the teams great and then we have

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,500
the domain working groups focusing in

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,860
different areas so all of these are

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,920
examples of basically growing out

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:43,450
successfully and getting a lot more done

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,830
but isn't it's not 100% easy right

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,870
there's there's a there's another side

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,190
to this and now it's one of the things I

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,340
want to talk about in this part is that

00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,680
there's like this some kind of tension

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:56,420
coming between

00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,559
succeeding at growing out the team and

00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:02,579
losing some of what you had before right

00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:05,759
so so one part of it is it's a lot of

00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:07,350
work to run these teams and and and do

00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,149
that it's basically but whereas before

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,189
you were writing code let's say if

00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:13,889
you're me and now you're kind of

00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:15,809
organizing you are doing some of it but

00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:16,769
leaving the best bits and you're doing a

00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:18,209
lot of other things that maybe is not

00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,920
what you originally had in mind what you

00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,420
originally signed up for right it's very

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,559
rewarding because you're seeing a lot of

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,749
things get done but it's not the same

00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,089
work anymore and one of the challenges

00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:28,379
that we have found is it can be

00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,660
sometimes hard for example to find

00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,790
people who have the time and willingness

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,079
to do this on a volunteer basis it might

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,309
be that they like doing it but they

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,869
don't have time because it takes a lot

00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:38,610
of time it might be that they don't like

00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:40,110
doing it that much orally so they don't

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,730
do it when they have their free time

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,990
right these two things and that's an

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,389
interesting challenge I think to try to

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,470
figure out how we can bridge that but

00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:49,350
there's something else to that's a

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,970
little more subtle which is initially

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,009
when it was just you running your

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,480
project or doing your thing you were

00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,699
managing all the decisions and yes it

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,249
was overwhelming but also it was kind of

00:13:56,699 --> 00:14:01,949
nice right everybody was recognizing who

00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:04,079
made this happen and now you have these

00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:06,410
other people coming in they're helping

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,550
but it feels a little bit like this

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,160
they're like taking some of that away

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,850
from you you know and you may find

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,959
yourself starting to do things that

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,639
intentionally you're not kind of getting

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,319
their way right you're like I'm just

00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,699
trying to help you there are some tips

00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:22,699
maybe you should write it this way

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,670
that's a little frustrating and you

00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:30,910
might find yourself kind of blocking

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,350
their vision so I would probably never

00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:41,279
have put this gif in here but actually

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:43,540
found it in so that's anyway so you so

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,929
this is a quote from from Aaron's

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,459
favorite book pretty much but it kind of

00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,379
gets a kiss right they do a lot of times

00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:51,610
the best way or at some point there

00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:53,319
comes a time when the best thing is to

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,660
allow other people to take the project

00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:56,980
and and sort of take ownership and take

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,639
it in directions that maybe you didn't

00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,619
originally intend or or know about so

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,269
this has come up also in the in the rust

00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:06,790
this is a quote it's actually not a

00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,720
quote I think we discovered it's what we

00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,629
all thought was a quote but we

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:15,579
discovered it was aa spera phrasing

00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:17,980
Florian chlorine skate or skate as I

00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:20,860
know him better but coming to do it

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,269
there are times when you know everyone

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,730
agrees there's some task it has to be

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,889
done and you think well the problem is

00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:29,199
we just don't have time to do it or to

00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:30,579
set up kind of oversee it being done so

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,170
that we can be sure it's done right and

00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:34,029
the end result is that there's this task

00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,470
just sitting there and there are people

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:37,240
who would be willing to do it but you're

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,829
sort of not allowing them to do it

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,699
because you wanted to have the oversight

00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:41,620
and you're afraid of what might happen

00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:44,290
and there's legitimate fear there but

00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,519
there's also sometimes the end result is

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,899
the task doesn't get done and it would

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,240
have gotten done and maybe gotten done

00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:53,319
in a way you didn't expect in a good way

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,579
so I actually have no idea what this

00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,459
thing is about but this picture was too

00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:59,499
good to cut but this is the like the

00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:07,540
feeling these sort of tensions they come

00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:11,589
out right all right that's partly I

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:13,269
didn't want to go there so these you can

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,249
sort of summarize this I think all these

00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:17,019
tensions I'm talking about that there's

00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:18,670
these two impulses both of which are

00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,980
good and both of which are necessary to

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:23,589
do the work that needs to be done

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,709
yourself but or to support other people

00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,119
doing the work and and they kind of work

00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:30,639
together but they also pull against

00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:32,649
right and it plays out so there's the

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,150
control like I was talking about I have

00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:37,880
an example of this it's like a road

00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:39,980
the small one but from early on we had

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,420
we wanted to add the DRF trait that

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,850
you're probably familiar with it lets

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,550
you overload the ref and we had this

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,900
idea of how to do it and we thought we'd

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,460
implemented I think I thought I would

00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,020
implement it probably and so and then

00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,390
Eddie B came along and this was when he

00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,580
was quite new appeared with the PR and

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,260
first I was like who is this writing

00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,240
this big PR and then I started reading

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,430
it and it's not done the way I would do

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,970
it actually it's done better than I

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,290
would do it why didn't I think of that

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,030
and so that was kind of the enjoying the

00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:14,030
ride part right as I realized it's good

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:15,350
this is awesome now we have DRF but and

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,320
there's also sometimes just a really

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,300
practical tension that arises of like we

00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,890
need to meet a deadline the fastest way

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,570
is if you know how to do it you can do

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,339
it faster but if you spend the time to

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,080
teach other people then of course that

00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:28,670
increases your overall throughput how do

00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,220
you balance those these things can be

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,270
really tricky there's no easy answer but

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,830
I think it's important to recognize that

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,330
both sides are positive if right there's

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,040
nothing wrong with doing it and there's

00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,780
also definitely nothing wrong with

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,990
helping others to do it so you have to

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:44,330
work them both alright with that I'll

00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:50,750
hand it over to Aaron so I'm gonna talk

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:52,790
about itching get ready yeah so there's

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:57,230
a sort of old-school notion and open

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:59,440
source that you know open source

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,360
projects essentially operate in this

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,040
very you know anarchic way where

00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,510
everybody's got their own personal

00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,400
motivations their own problems they want

00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:09,350
to solve and they're basically showing

00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,630
up to scratch their own itch and somehow

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,390
this all comes together into a coherent

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:17,540
project and we've definitely had

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:22,250
experiences along these lines in rust so

00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:25,850
burnt sushi is one of one of my favorite

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,370
restorations is is Andrew here Aaron

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,710
doesn't have favorites don't worry

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:33,410
you're all my favorite but I think I

00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,940
think burnt sushi is really just you

00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,250
know writes these exemplary libraries

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:42,590
he's been an incredible force in rust

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:44,360
and this pull request back from 2014 was

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,640
essentially his introduction to the rust

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,740
community alright so I remember I had

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,260
not been involved in rust very

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,649
at this point and I just remember the

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:58,669
team being kind of baffled that this guy

00:18:53,649 --> 00:19:00,169
showed up from nowhere with a red regex

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:03,409
implementation that was super high

00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:05,090
quality that we weren't really actively

00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,590
asking for like there was an issue that

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,120
said oh this is a high priority but

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,620
nobody was assigned to work on it or

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,690
whatever and then just BAM

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,039
there it was and of course this has

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,590
become the regex

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,899
crate which has made its way all the way

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,740
into the rustling work and all that can

00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:23,809
we admire this pull request text also

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,340
it's just so humble and so amazing links

00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:27,500
to documentation and benchmarks are in

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,669
the RFC I apologize if I made any

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:36,010
amateur mistakes I've only been around

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:38,779
for one month yeah so you know sometimes

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,460
this can work out well right so this

00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:43,700
sort of it's scratching thing you can

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:46,159
think of it as in the good case oh s s

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,980
open-source software by serendipity

00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:52,820
right and so in a case like burnt sushi

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:55,850
it's like oh great now we have regular

00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:59,720
expressions this is awesome right but it

00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,980
doesn't always work that way so I didn't

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,919
actually realize Niko was going to talk

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,270
about Eddie as well but he's another

00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:08,240
another of my favorites you're all my

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:11,779
favorite Eddie's been around for a long

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,490
time he started as a high school student

00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:18,409
contributing to rust and he also would

00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,600
show up as niko was saying with a

00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:23,450
different anecdote with these massive

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:27,860
pull requests that in this case nobody

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:30,049
was asking for and this was a good pull

00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,270
request you know it was something that

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,919
sort of needed to be done eventually but

00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:36,049
I don't know if you can see the details

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,059
here but the pull request was open at

00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:41,000
the beginning of April and merged in

00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:43,610
mid-september which is not really how we

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,200
like things to run and it's not like

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,960
there was this super active discussion

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,220
or revisions or whatever it was that the

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,710
team just didn't know what to do with

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,690
this and we weren't comfortable just

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,580
turning it down because you know he had

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,559
done a lot of work but we couldn't

00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,660
really prioritize reviewing it or

00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:02,580
getting it landed right so

00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:06,450
OSS by serendipity sometimes works out

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:11,310
well sometimes we don't really know

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:15,720
what's going on right and sometimes it

00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:17,400
can get you know a little catty so the

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,860
other thing to notice about serendipity

00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,860
which I think is really important is

00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,270
that it really if you're trying to run

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,430
your project through this kind of

00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,190
serendipity and personal itch scratching

00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:31,860
you're selecting for a certain kind of

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,690
person probably a person who has a

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,780
certain amount of privilege a person who

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,760
feels comfortable just coming out of

00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,650
nowhere and saying I did this thing pay

00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,350
attention to me right but there are a

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,850
lot of people out there who don't have

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,110
that comfort level or don't have the

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,510
privilege that would let them do this

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:51,600
and if you run your project this way

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:54,810
you're missing out on that huge pool of

00:21:51,600 --> 00:22:03,900
energy and talent so what's the

00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:05,370
alternative well my idea is that we get

00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,750
people to all itchy in the same

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:12,770
direction right and you know I don't

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,770
know how many of you know this

00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:18,340
but if you asked graden about the name

00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:20,629
rust he will tell you about fungus you

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:24,009
can google it it's actually quite

00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:26,659
beautiful so yeah I mean so basically

00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:29,119
just giving all of you this shared

00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:31,730
fungus is totally the the answer to this

00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,950
serendipity thing right and then we can

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:36,049
all be sort of jumping in the same way

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:40,940
yeah you didn't have to go there not the

00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:43,220
whole way yeah okay so so more seriously

00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,009
right the the contrast I want to draw

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,590
out is you can do open source by

00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:51,559
serendipity that's the traditional model

00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:54,649
of very decentralized individualistic

00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:57,860
yada yada or you can do open source on

00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:59,690
purpose there are there are a lot of

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,970
aspects of you know what that looks like

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,499
in practice and it connects back to some

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:06,799
of the things that that Nika was

00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:10,730
touching on the you know the fundamental

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:13,100
idea is giving people some structures to

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,450
work with so that they know what

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,740
contributions are needed they know how

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,960
to make those contributions you're

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,850
actively welcome welcoming and inviting

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,700
them right and so this works at

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,980
different scales at the small scale

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,899
there's something we call quest issues

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,369
which is a pattern we've used a lot and

00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:34,190
the rest community where you've got some

00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:35,720
some thing to do a lot of different

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,269
times in a lot of different places and

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,429
so you can write out instructions for

00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:43,100
how to do this thing and then have a big

00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:44,830
checklist of doing that thing for all

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,559
the things right and so in this case

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:53,119
this is from Nick Fitzgerald on the

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:55,309
waves and working group hey Nick and

00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:59,360
it's basically like filling out API

00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:01,279
bindings for the Dom and this is like

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,340
catnip I mean every time one of these

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,409
goes up it's just like you cannot get

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,570
yourself assigned to one of these items

00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:10,999
fast enough they just get snapped up

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:13,119
right away and so this is a great way to

00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:15,499
get a bunch of people into the process

00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,850
you know in a lightweight way make them

00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:18,139
feel good about the contribution and

00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:22,460
then you can start more actively

00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:24,350
mentoring them at the medium scale we've

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,490
talked a lot recently about working

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,370
groups and working groups are

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:32,220
sort of this new frontier of rust teams

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,870
right so we have the the teams that have

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,700
been around for a while who are making

00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,820
the big decisions about the direction of

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,950
rust and the working groups are a little

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,059
bit less formal than that and it's just

00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,640
let's get a bunch of people together

00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,770
with some kind of shared tasks and you

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,690
know a couple of leaders and see what we

00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:51,600
can get done and this has been working

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,670
out really well this year with rust 2018

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,429
around these domain working groups which

00:24:53,670 --> 00:25:00,210
you mentioned earlier and then finally

00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:02,760
at the largest scale you know in rust

00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,340
we've implemented various visionary

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,500
processes right so we have a road map

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,270
process each year this is we've talked

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,890
about this at each of the previous rust

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,610
comps you know what what is ahead for

00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:16,590
this year even the addition itself the

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,710
idea of an addition is to sort of lay

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,900
out this vision and this is a really key

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,390
aspect of spreading that fungus right

00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,710
like that basically you're saying okay

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,950
we're generally heading in this

00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:31,410
direction so if you are not eating in

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:34,140
that direction we're probably not that

00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:36,690
interested in your work right now and

00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:40,110
it's a hard message but it's much nicer

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:42,660
if you can frame it within this positive

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:45,960
vision rather than just saying no we're

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,910
not gonna take your PR I'm sorry I mean

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,590
how does that I think it also helps like

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,000
those PRS sometimes arise because people

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,150
are looking for something to do they

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,860
want to be a part and I don't know what

00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,270
the priorities are right they would

00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,370
happily do something that's priority if

00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,700
it's clear to them what it is yeah

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,700
exactly

00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:09,210
so the overall message about all this

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:11,660
bitching is that like motivation and and

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,460
I experienced this a lot as a manager I

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:17,490
don't as a manager I don't tell people

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,000
what to do very much and when I've tried

00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:24,059
it it doesn't tend to work and instead

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,330
you know I have to get them to want it

00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:30,540
themselves right we have to come to some

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:32,010
kind of consensus right so I was told

00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,470
that I needed to perform this gesture

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:37,920
Nikko said that he was unwilling to but

00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:41,430
I'm going to inspire and

00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,430
come on Neko

00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:51,730
thank you can all day had to lead the

00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,440
way you were inspirational yes yes right

00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,200
so this this all sounds pretty good

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,940
right so we we started with the

00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,920
serendipity thing we saw the downsides

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,580
it's like okay well will will shift to

00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,440
the fungal model and do this you know

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:11,200
OSS on purpose this fungus stuff was not

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:13,500
in the practice right so you might think

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,900
you know it's all unicorns and rainbows

00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,070
but of course like real life is a little

00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,980
more complicated than that

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,960
so even after we put all of these

00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,520
practices into place and we had roadmaps

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,930
and we had a lot of clarity about the

00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,940
direction that doesn't stop people from

00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:33,400
you know coming up with their own ideas

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,100
and putting a lot of work into something

00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,710
that's not on the roadmap and this is

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:41,320
always a challenge for the teams so this

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:44,080
this example from a Ruska meeting member

00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,570
ticky is something that probably a lot

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,550
of you have seen in are excited about

00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,930
constant generics it's something that

00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,330
people have been asking for for a long

00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,550
time the team had thought about it and

00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:58,090
said not this year it's not on the

00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:59,560
roadmap nevertheless taking really cared

00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,840
about it and went and wrote an RFC

00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,490
all right and there was a lot of

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,690
community support if you see like the

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,490
emoji reactions everybody's really

00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:10,660
excited about this and so there's a

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:13,000
conundrum of you know you set out this

00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,250
direction the serendipitous stuff still

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,620
happens so what do you do and I think we

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,900
don't have the perfect answer to this

00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:22,660
we're still feeling it out in this

00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,400
particular case we ended up helping we

00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,800
ended up taking some time to help ticky

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,110
get this RFC to the right place and we

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,320
got it landed so I you know I think it

00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,520
worked out pretty well at the end and

00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,920
you know if I were to try to summarize

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,380
this I would say we want to set out a

00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,050
vision we want to prioritize the work

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,550
that we think is high-impact but we

00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,350
still need to leave some room for

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:47,740
serendipity that's still a really

00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:49,630
important part of doing open source and

00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:53,350
it's you know it's not all one or the

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:55,010
other so to sort of summarize the

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,809
overall tension here

00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:58,580
and in this section of the talk on the

00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:00,620
one hand you know we want to build

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,720
capacity and sometimes that means

00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:05,029
letting people come and just do what

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,740
they want to do but on the other hand we

00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:07,909
need to stay focused and so this is a

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,120
delicate balance and it's something

00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:16,730
we're continually working on yeah very

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:19,190
delicate okay it's haggled time right no

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:19,639
I'm just kidding yeah that comes later I

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,580
promise

00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:25,190
yeah so the final thing that we wanted

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,860
to talk about here was this idea of true

00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,450
openness and so kind of looking around

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,580
the room I think we can already see some

00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,830
of the work that rust has done to create

00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:36,350
a really large welcoming community with

00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,970
a ton of folks in it and this is because

00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,399
we tend to focus on these two ideas

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,889
first the idea of pluralism and then

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,360
secondly this idea of positive sums and

00:29:42,889 --> 00:29:46,070
so sometimes this is a little bit

00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,590
jargony so I'm gonna kind of define it

00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:50,269
so pluralism is this condition or system

00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,820
in which two or more states groups

00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:55,220
principals sources of authority all can

00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:57,380
be happily coexisting and so kind of

00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,850
just alone this idea of pluralism is

00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,029
like oh yeah great that's super

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,830
idealistic but like in practice like how

00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:08,960
does that actually work and so clearly

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:12,350
it's time for some game theory all right

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,970
so in many ways it's often nice to talk

00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,350
about things in opposition's which

00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,470
hopefully you've been picking up on

00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:19,909
today but the thing that a lot of people

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,250
are probably familiar with this is the

00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:24,590
idea of a zero-sum game which is this

00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:27,700
kind of representation of a situation

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:30,440
where each participants gain or you know

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,539
ability to get something is going to be

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,769
kind of balanced out by somebody losing

00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,929
something the way you can kind of

00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:38,179
summarize this is your gain is my loss

00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:40,840
and so anytime somebody is winning that

00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:42,529
means that somebody else is losing and

00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,260
fundamentally if you want something

00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:47,570
that's pluralistic they can get

00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,340
antagonistic incredibly quickly and so

00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,549
what Russ really likes to view the

00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:54,830
community and its systems as is a

00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:57,830
positive sum game which is to say that

00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,269
the gains of everyone the gains the

00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,830
losses when you add them all up we're

00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:02,690
gonna end up with something greater than

00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:05,120
zero this is gonna be a positive effect

00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,919
and the kumbaya way to say this is the

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,350
whole is greater than

00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:11,090
some of its parts and that's a little

00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:14,359
saccharine but also that's kind of

00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:16,749
really awesome and it's something that I

00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:19,100
think has led to a lot of rust successes

00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,749
but while it is something that sounds

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,690
really awesome this is also an intense

00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:26,179
gamble the idea that we have a plural

00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:30,169
sum game and that it's actually going to

00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:32,570
work I mean in theory it looks like this

00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:35,389
right like we let our powers combined

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:39,980
and then together you know the heart of

00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:44,989
rust and the earth of C++ and yes this

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:49,460
metaphor does continue we all come

00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:51,080
together and we form captain rust which

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,049
is I guess a new Farris I'm gonna have

00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,340
to draw and this is ideal right this is

00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:57,320
what we want we want all these people

00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,220
with incredibly different perspectives

00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:03,919
coming together and forming this amazing

00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:06,649
pollution fighting group and that's

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,809
awesome but the trick is is like this is

00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:12,220
not guaranteed when you get all these

00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:15,619
people together it it might just

00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:18,830
collapse it might just fall apart and

00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:20,330
that's actually pretty scary the work

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,590
that we're doing here in the type of

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:26,029
community that we're trying to develop

00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:27,919
in rust is a work in progress and we

00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:30,440
can't actually be sure that it's going

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,600
to work out and what we're aiming for is

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,869
this idea of truly open consensus

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,369
seeking at scale which like I can't even

00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:40,639
think of state governments that have

00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:43,399
really pulled this off and so I have

00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:47,600
doubts but I also think that this is

00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:49,970
amazing work to be trying to do and so I

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,259
want to believe and so that's why I'm

00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,789
here and that's why I participate in

00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:55,489
rust and I think that this is like an

00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:57,830
amazing endeavor that could have impact

00:32:55,489 --> 00:33:01,460
across not only open source software but

00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,960
a lot of society and so a lot of people

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,970
are familiar with our attempts to do

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,070
this really truly open process with the

00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:11,169
RFC process how many people here have

00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:16,279
written in RFC commented on an RFC

00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:17,659
enjoyed it oh no I think people didn't

00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,900
know there was a third question I'm just

00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:21,380
gonna

00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:23,090
that was the case um sorry about that so

00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,070
yeah we have this RFC process and the

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:28,370
RFC process has had a little bit of an

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:31,070
evolution so the main idea behind the

00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:33,230
RFC process is this idea of no new

00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,790
rationale and this actually didn't come

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:36,500
up out of the first part of the RFC

00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:40,190
process but kind of emerged later

00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:43,610
because the original RFC process wasn't

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:45,440
really open it kind of gave a little bit

00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,820
of lip service to openness like it was

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,530
there you know how you can just put

00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,440
something on github but that doesn't

00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:53,570
make it open source it was kind of like

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,910
that and so this is a quote from

00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,190
somebody who felt the need to call rust

00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,200
out on it basically there was this RFC

00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,390
that happened and you know people in the

00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,740
core team didn't really participate

00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,750
instead they went off into a room had

00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,940
their own conversation showed up and

00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:10,010
said we thought about it here's the

00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,810
solution and everyone was like what the

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,100
hell that's not cool

00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,630
like we're all here in this room

00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,610
chatting and you just like pieced out

00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,409
and then like called the shots that's

00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,340
not what true openness is about and if

00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:21,080
we're gonna put the effort to

00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,149
participate in this process the leaders

00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,620
better also and if you're not gonna be

00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:26,510
here that's not gonna succeed and that's

00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,580
where this idea of no new rationale

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,200
happened and so all decisions need to be

00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,610
discussed in the public and I'll tell

00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,100
you right now as I said we're still

00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:36,140
working so if you see this happen call

00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:39,980
it out we care about it and it really

00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:42,020
matters so to give a small example about

00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:47,000
the RFC process that I think potentially

00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:52,340
I see people cringing good that was the

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,380
purpose yeah so this year I guess it's

00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,810
been kind of going on for a long time at

00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:00,410
this point but there's in this great

00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:03,470
module system debate and there's been

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:08,540
multiple blog posts multiple internals

00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:11,420
process posts multiple RFC's and there's

00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:15,620
a lot of feelings involved in these

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:19,130
RFC's and eventually we did reach an RFC

00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:20,900
that ended up getting accepted but there

00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,910
was a lot of work here and if you read

00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,450
Aaron's comment he's already addressing

00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:28,640
this idea of fatigue and while the RFC

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,660
process allows us to approach this idea

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,579
of true open

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:35,000
it definitely still has some of its

00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:37,849
downsides also just as an aside github

00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,430
reactions are not votes true openness

00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:42,890
involves commenting and participating

00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:46,130
fully and if you want to vent it's

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:49,039
probably best to do it in private and

00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:54,380
not with emoji or just use positive

00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:55,940
emojis anyways so Aaron who has written

00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,099
a several of these blog posts and if you

00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:00,200
were unaware that Aaron has like I guess

00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:01,700
I call it the feelings blog I actually

00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,319
don't know the official name does that

00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,109
work all right great

00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:08,480
he has a feelings blog and it's friggin

00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:10,460
awesome and in it he says that the

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,430
module saga demonstrates both the

00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,829
payoffs and the pathologies are getting

00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,069
a little Freudian here yeah nice all

00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:17,900
right

00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:19,849
of the RFC process and it played out

00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,220
over a dozen different threads reaching

00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:26,450
fourteen hundred plus comments in total

00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:28,280
which is impressive and so in taking a

00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,020
look at this saga kind of identified a

00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,780
couple of things that are downsides of

00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:35,660
the RFC process so the first is momentum

00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,490
and it's funny I've been writing a

00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,520
couple of RCS over the past year and

00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:43,279
somebody told me like very sincerely you

00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,279
know an RFC rarely survives its first

00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:49,970
comment which is to say whatever that

00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:52,339
first comment is it's very likely to set

00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:54,589
the tone for the entire discussion in a

00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:56,720
way that is very difficult to evade

00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:58,910
afterwards there needs to be a lot of

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,549
effort to kind of steer it away from

00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,750
when the person has started and this

00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:04,339
doesn't necessarily mean that the

00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,170
original commenter has done anything

00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:08,569
wrong but it's kind of just the way

00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,339
momentum works it's the way that threads

00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:11,960
work it's this linear thing and so you

00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:14,210
start going down one and then it kind of

00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,890
builds off that and suddenly we're

00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,059
talking a lot more about the thread then

00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,819
we're talking about the original

00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:23,329
artifact to begin with the second one is

00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:26,420
urgency which is men we give so many

00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:28,900
 in the Russ community holy we

00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,600
care hard

00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:33,040
all right the stakes are high like a lot

00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,480
of us see this language is like the

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,400
language that makes them like

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,290
programming again and like that's pretty

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,300
serious like if that's your job and this

00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,980
is what makes you happy then like yeah

00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,390
it changes to it are serious and they

00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:45,640
kind of hit you right here

00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:47,440
and so that urgency is is something

00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,850
that's super real but I can guarantee

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,310
that all of us can think of a situation

00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:53,080
we're dealing with something or making a

00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,630
decision probably would go a lot better

00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,550
if you didn't have to do it quickly like

00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,230
if you remove the urgency suddenly a lot

00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,970
of our ability is to like cope and

00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,470
function with other people return and

00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,970
then when we're scared and needing to

00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:07,360
rush suddenly we like don't know how to

00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,950
people anymore and all of this kind of

00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,250
culminates and this thing was fatigue

00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:15,070
like 14 hundred plus comments like I

00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,650
have a lot of stuff to do and reading

00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,240
threads exhausts me and you can tell it

00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:21,250
exhausts other people when you look at

00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,990
the module system debate so many people

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:26,800
were a part of the original one and

00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:28,630
slowly they just were dropping off not

00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,630
because necessarily they were pissed but

00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:34,360
like they just couldn't anymore like it

00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,590
it is so much to ask of people and it's

00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,510
one of the interesting things about

00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,850
scale scale is this amazing thing that

00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,380
kind of points to rest success but it's

00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,990
also kind of getting us to this pot

00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:46,390
we're like how do we fit everyone in

00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,400
this room and be able to hear everyone

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,900
at the same time it's an incredibly

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,880
difficult problem and again this is

00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,310
something that like people haven't

00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,200
solved yet and like it's one of the

00:38:54,310 --> 00:39:00,640
biggest problems of the internet

00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,230
generally so this kind of brings me back

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,460
to this book that Aaron really likes

00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:07,930
where it says you know the fundamental

00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:09,310
response to change is not logical even

00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,930
though I know we're programmers and we

00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:13,540
assume that everything we do is friggin

00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,950
logical it's not our very first response

00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,350
to change is always going to be

00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:19,420
emotional so you probably kind of feel

00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:25,150
like this and that maybe that's removing

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:27,720
the mod key word maybe it's okay to feel

00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:30,310
this way as I said the stakes are real

00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,900
but if you've got a roomful of these

00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,370
rabid corgis and there's like a lot of

00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,250
lettuce for some reason like you're

00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:39,020
gonna have a bad time

00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:40,470
it's not gonna work out super great oh

00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:43,470
yeah

00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:45,300
so a lot of the sensation often happens

00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,940
particularly when we start thinking in

00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,800
this zero-sum way like oh no like the

00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,780
room is too full not everybody can get

00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,090
here everyone and so there's this

00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,619
sentiment that like okay luckily enough

00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:57,480
of us are gonna yell and we're gonna

00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,400
stop this really scary proposal from

00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,740
happening and we have to keep talking

00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,260
because if we don't stop shouting about

00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,359
this the evil people are gonna do the

00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,420
thing that we don't want them to do and

00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:11,700
this is like a terrifying attitude but

00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,170
this is real and like I have to be

00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,810
honest like I've felt this way before

00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,960
and I bet people in the audience have

00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:21,540
also felt this way before it's a it's a

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,950
real feel and it's kind of weird and

00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,390
bums me out knowing that I relate to

00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:27,180
this because it kind of echoes this

00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:29,070
quote which is and I'm gonna read it

00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,859
because it's amazing that it's a real

00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:34,320
quote I honestly despised being subtle

00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:36,900
or nice the fact is people need to know

00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,880
what my positions on things are and I

00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,420
can't just say please don't do that

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,460
because people won't listen I say on the

00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,180
internet nobody can hear you being

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,950
subtle and I mean it so I don't know if

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:55,980
you know the quote or the author it's

00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:57,420
this person whatever but fundamentally

00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,119
what we're seeing here is there's this

00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,420
vibe of like I want to be able to wield

00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:06,510
power but like the real thing I want to

00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,280
do is be able to change minds and these

00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,200
things are at a fascinating tension

00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,430
because wielding power is important

00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,400
we've heard about the need to focus

00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:16,470
we've heard the needs of a inspire power

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,810
is a great recognition tool having it

00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:20,430
can feel like a reward but in the end

00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,560
when we have all these people in the

00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:24,690
room and we are all trying to seek

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,060
consensus the thing that we need to be

00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:30,150
focusing on really is changing minds and

00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,609
using the power that we have to work on

00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,619
reaching that consensus instead of kind

00:41:32,609 --> 00:41:36,240
of enforcing it and saying that your

00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,510
idea is the one that people need to go

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,640
with so again this idea of us versus

00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,770
them that the big fatties are just going

00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,510
to swat you away and that you need to

00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:49,190
get all your buddies together to fight

00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:49,190
the big evil cat

00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,089
but instead you can kind of just view it

00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,859
the other way

00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:58,599
with the module system song I think a

00:41:56,859 --> 00:42:00,670
lot of people think by the end of the

00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:04,599
RFC that they had gotten the original

00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:06,430
people to compromise but if you talk to

00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,020
the original people a lot of them will

00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:10,270
say that it wasn't a compromise at all

00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,789
in fact what happened was over an

00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:16,000
incredibly long and very emotionally

00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:18,309
draining process we actually just came

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,289
up with a better idea like the final

00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:22,750
process like the final thing we got was

00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:25,000
it like me like saying okay fine you get

00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:27,760
that I get this it was just it genuinely

00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,619
just created a better solution and that

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,410
is what this idea of positive sum game

00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:34,780
is that even though it can feel a little

00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:36,609
like a battle our gains and losses

00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:40,240
together end up producing something is

00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:42,490
better than just the status quo so

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,440
infinite kind of like us to see it a

00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:46,480
little bit like this where maybe there's

00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,730
a battle but we're really kind of on the

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,890
same side and in fact you should this is

00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:52,420
literally Spider Man empathizing with

00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:55,750
himself and there's a cop car I don't

00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:58,510
know why that's there but like again a

00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:00,279
battle but it's kind of for show and

00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:01,900
maybe a little bit more collaborative

00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:03,369
you have a lot more in common with the

00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,450
other people are those threads then you

00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:09,250
might actually think so that's why we

00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:11,020
believe that true openness is something

00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:13,779
that we really want and as I said again

00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:16,059
it is a work in progress but I would be

00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:18,819
totally remiss if I didn't bring up this

00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:21,099
point where is this like kind of utopian

00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:23,589
idea of total openness where everyone

00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:25,930
walks in on this equal platform is like

00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:29,079
actually I can guarantee you that that's

00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:30,670
impossible and not going to happen and

00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:32,559
there's a couple of factors about that

00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:35,410
like Russ is an open source project and

00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,960
open source is a huge political

00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:40,510
situation and how money is used in it is

00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,890
really common and so I mean a lot of

00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:45,430
times will do work and you have this

00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:48,430
like you pay me feel but you know

00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:50,349
for some people like they can't do the

00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,940
work unless you pay them like there's no

00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:53,380
way because like they have to live and

00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,240
stuff and the money's gonna make that

00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,950
happen and so if you have an entire

00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,099
ecosystem that has all of its velocity

00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:01,270
from people who aren't getting paid then

00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:02,680
the people the

00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:05,920
people who knew that many don't show up

00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,650
because they physically can't and that's

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,240
like a really big problem but even if we

00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:12,700
were somehow able to bracket the

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,350
economics portion out of this and this

00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,980
is gonna get real so stare at the Corgi

00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:21,390
if you don't like it like rust is

00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:23,710
probably the most open and inclusive

00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:26,590
open-source project I've ever worked in

00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:28,810
and I've worked in a lot but like I'm on

00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:31,990
the core team I like do a ton of work

00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:34,630
and there's rough spaces that I don't

00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:38,140
feel comfortable and like that like I

00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,010
able to try and participate and like I

00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,040
don't know someone says I'm a bad

00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:43,270
engineer because I use emojis I don't

00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,610
know like why the hell would you even

00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:48,280
say that that's ridiculous

00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:49,660
but like Russ not perfect and this isn't

00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,670
trying to call out that there's like

00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:53,680
some bad actor here who's doing

00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:56,470
something wrong but like there's just

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,200
like history and material conditions and

00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:01,300
like I don't know it's 2018 and a lot of

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,010
years happened before that and a lot of

00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,690
stuff happened before that

00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:07,180
and just because rust has a code of

00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:10,060
conduct doesn't change that that's the

00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:12,040
case and so when we think about openness

00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,080
a lot of us are programmers and we love

00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,570
thinking about first principles openness

00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,790
and like yeah sure that would be cool

00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:21,160
but we can't rip ourselves out of time

00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:24,130
and space so we have to realize that

00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:27,820
true openness doesn't work unless we

00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:29,590
also bolster people up which means

00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:31,090
finding the people who have a lot less

00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:33,520
of the options and a lot less of the

00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:34,210
opportunities and giving them those

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,670
opportunities

00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:38,230
not because they asked or because they

00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:40,600
did something or like show they were

00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:43,000
worth it but because we care about

00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,030
making equal opportunity like a real

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,030
thing

00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:59,040
look at this pumpkin its pumpkin its

00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:03,360
pumpkins inequality and the corgis

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:05,880
taking it out alright so we've been

00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,110
talking a lot about conflicts here and

00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,880
so it's like what's the conflict going

00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:10,380
on here and I couldn't really come up

00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,970
with one it turns out there's so many

00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,560
internal conflicts with the idea of

00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,690
openness that I'll just show it as

00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,940
opposed to itself it's an incredibly

00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:19,380
complicated idea and like so often we

00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:23,430
think of it as this like kind of shallow

00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:29,400
obvious thing and so yeah I guess with

00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:31,010
that it's Nicko's turn okay so I don't

00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,320
know if you noticed there was a theme

00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:37,560
[Laughter]

00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:39,840
conflict opposition this is a theme that

00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,520
it turns out not well I don't know maybe

00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,530
it's on purpose we've been hitting for a

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,810
long time a lot of different ways

00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,920
through a lot of different keynotes so

00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:50,640
you may remember some of these slogans

00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:53,070
from years past and they're all kind of

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,720
of this of the same nature right that we

00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:57,660
want to have these two things that are

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,790
in opposition but where we can find some

00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:03,570
kind of way to resolve that opposition

00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:05,820
to find a third way to kind of get the

00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:08,670
best of both worlds and get them both

00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,680
and that's kind of where we're out here

00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:14,790
with this talk no this is definitely

00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,290
Ashley what I promised you here all

00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,940
right so I know I started talking about

00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:22,260
genealogies but I'm gonna end with this

00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:28,200
amazing idea of dialectics what we made

00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:29,630
a slide for the response so similar to

00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,740
this little idea of opposition's

00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:34,200
understanding what a dialectic is is

00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,690
often a a great way to figure it out is

00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,980
to see it as opposed to formal logic how

00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:40,350
many people here studied any sort of

00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,170
formal logic math all right you're gonna

00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:45,360
hate this

00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:47,760
so in general formal logic states that

00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,830
things are what they are and that they

00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,020
stand in definite relationships to each

00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:56,070
other it's kind of this law of identity

00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:57,750
thing where we say a equals a so may

00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:00,060
realize that I'm about to say that this

00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:03,150
is incorrect there are hidden variables

00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:05,010
all right so no this is actually what

00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:07,410
dialectics are opposed to

00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:11,100
so in formal logic it says hey when we

00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:14,910
reach a contradiction we're wrong and

00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:17,070
I'm here to say that's not the case all

00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:19,260
right so the hidden variable here is

00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:22,320
time and so things are able to change

00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:25,380
over time and so I like to say a does

00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:29,070
not equal a and this is a good an

00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:30,780
amazingly great thing so this is idea of

00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,950
the dialectical method and lots of

00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,200
philosophers worked on it including

00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,790
Hegel but it says that the dialectical

00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,920
method in contrast to the method of

00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:40,080
formal logic trains us to identify these

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,020
contradictions and thereby get to the

00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,210
bottom of the changes taking place so

00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:47,100
this is what a dialectic looks like and

00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:48,990
the idea is that all change in progress

00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,910
comes from this progression of

00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:52,380
dialectics and if this is like a little

00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,090
heavy because this talk has been forever

00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:56,550
and you need some more animated gifs I

00:48:54,090 --> 00:49:00,410
found one this explains dialectics

00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:00,410
perfectly wait for it

00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:12,750
that one's right yeah so it's also

00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:14,340
visualized kind of as this spiral and as

00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:16,740
you can see there's this growth pattern

00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,750
and that what fuels the growth and the

00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,970
progression over time is this idea of

00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:22,320
contradiction so again in formal logic

00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:25,170
and I've seen this happen in programming

00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,820
so many times it's like oh this doesn't

00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:29,700
work there's a contradiction this failed

00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:32,340
we're wrong and the answer is no this is

00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,690
the opportunity for change this is where

00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,950
the growth is going to come from because

00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:37,230
these fundamental contradictions are

00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:40,170
what fueled history all right all right

00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:41,580
enough philosophy let me go over here so

00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:45,780
let's bring this back to rust

00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:47,609
so what's interesting so Nikko wrote a

00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,200
blog post you might have read recently

00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:51,720
talking about some new ideas around the

00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,820
RFC process and there's a strange kind

00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:58,950
of resemblance actually visually to this

00:49:53,820 --> 00:50:00,480
dialectic process and you know as Nico

00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:03,060
was saying in some sense this has always

00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,000
been part of rusts process and in some

00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:08,280
sense this talk is really about relating

00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,560
those technical opposition's to also

00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,109
opposition's around people systems there

00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,000
are lots of contradictions or apparent

00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:17,310
contradictions that we're trying to

00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,540
resolve and we are definitely on that

00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:20,550
spiral right

00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:23,700
we're constantly refining our people

00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:28,320
processes but we're also refining rust

00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:32,870
itself right so rust today is not rust

00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:36,840
tomorrow and in a sense you know this is

00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:39,900
like a long kong like the whole addition

00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:43,560
process guess what it's about dialectics

00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:46,740
right so rust 2018 is not the same as

00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:48,270
rust 2015 it's a refinement we're

00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:50,490
getting smarter we're understanding the

00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:52,770
contradictions better we're synthesizing

00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:55,500
new ideas and I think the the RFC

00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:59,880
process really epitomizes that kind of

00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:02,100
dialectic method when it works well so

00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,770
to kind of wrap this up right this has

00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,230
been a talk about opposition's we've

00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:10,020
seen a ton of them just to sort of recap

00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:12,240
right we saw at the beginning with

00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:14,670
Nico's section there's doing vs.

00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,320
supporting both desirable things but

00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:18,480
you've got to strike a balance same with

00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,400
latency versus throughput I've talked

00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,340
about building capacity out versus

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:27,480
staying focused and Ashley talked about

00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:28,920
the complexities of openness you know

00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,210
but the the point is the point of all

00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,070
this is that opposition's are

00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:34,080
inescapable they are a part of life

00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:36,110
they're at the heart of systems whether

00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:40,500
those systems are about people or

00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:43,740
software but I think one of the really

00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:46,680
fundamental messages here is that there

00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:49,950
are conflicts but conflicts don't have

00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:52,020
to generate heat right that is the

00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:54,540
natural response all those feelings are

00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:57,930
legitimate and should be vented

00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:59,550
somewhere but I think rust and its

00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:01,530
community is at its best when we can

00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,120
have those conflicts and work through

00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:07,710
them together in this sort of positive

00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:09,930
some white in other words to get to the

00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:12,150
synthesis we have to do a lot of people

00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:14,130
things right we have to be good at

00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:16,710
listening to one another we have to have

00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:20,520
a diversity of ideas and we have to

00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:23,520
pursue this idea of openness right so I

00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:27,030
think our message today is that rust

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:30,050
just is about this synthesis it's about

00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:30,050
positive sums

00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:43,799
oh go back to sorry I screwed this up

00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:45,170
watch the whole gif it's important Thank

00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:47,069
You Ashley

00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,310
alright and with that we're at the end

00:52:47,069 --> 00:52:57,640
of the talk thank you very much

00:52:48,310 --> 00:53:06,740
[Applause]

00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:07,710
[Music]

00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:13,849
you

00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:13,849
