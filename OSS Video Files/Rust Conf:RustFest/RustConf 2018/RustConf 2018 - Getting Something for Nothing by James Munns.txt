	RustConf 2018 - Getting Something for Nothing by James Munns

This talk explores how to use the Rust Type System and Borrow Checker to write safe abstractions of hardware, even when using direct control of memory mapped peripherals with unsafe blocks. Because these techniques move all (or most) of the checking to compile time, these techniques are perfect for systems where high performance or resource constraints are a requirement.

This talk will explain and explore how these techniques are used on Microcontroller systems as a critical part of the embedded-hal ecosystem.
