	RustConf 2018 - Benchmarking and Optimization of Rust Libraries by Paul Mason

As we develop the Rust eco-system we have a goal that "Rust should provide easy access to high quality crates". This means libraries must be both ergonomic and perform well. Rust provides various frameworks to help benchmark libraries however achieving performance past a certain point requires knowledge of some deep language constructs.

This talk explores a journey towards benchmarking various library functions consistently and fairly and consequently exploring strategies for optimizing performance.
