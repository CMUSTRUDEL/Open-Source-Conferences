Title: RustCon Asia 2019 - Ravi Shankar: How Rust taught me to think about systems
Publication date: 2019-04-30
Playlist: RustCon Asia 2019
Description: 
	All Rustaceans know that Rust’s borrow checker is merciless to newcomers. This talk covers the pain points encountered by me, back when I was a newcomer to Rust (and systems, in general). We’ll see a variety of situations which are totally normal in a number of high-level languages but not in Rust, how the same code differed in Rust, how the errors made sense after a while, and how that changed me to think about approaching problems from there on. If you’re looking for motivation to get into Rust, or if it made you angry or scared you away at some point, then this talk is for you!
