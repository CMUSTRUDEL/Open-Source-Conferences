Title: [Chinese] RustCon Asia 2019 - driftluo: Implementing a p2p network framework
Publication date: 2019-05-01
Playlist: RustCon Asia 2019
Description: 
	I will probably talk about the development of this library, the problems encountered, and so on, and explain the implementation of each small library.

This library is a small supplement to the Rust network ecosystem. I hope that more people will participate in the Rust ecosystem. Such a good language should have better ecological support.
