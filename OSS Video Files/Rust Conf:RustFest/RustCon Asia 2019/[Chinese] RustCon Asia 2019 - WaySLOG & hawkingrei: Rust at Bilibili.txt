Description: 
	Bilibili is an online video barrage website. We are happy to try new technology, and Rust is also the language I am optimistic about. Today we will introduce to you three of our components that use Rust:

- Caching proxy component
- Image processing component
- Compile the remote cache component

I would like to introduce you to some of the problems we encountered when using Rust and a little experience, I hope to help everyone.
