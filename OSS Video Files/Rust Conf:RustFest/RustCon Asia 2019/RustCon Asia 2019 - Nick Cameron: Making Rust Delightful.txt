Title: RustCon Asia 2019 - Nick Cameron: Making Rust Delightful
Publication date: 2019-04-30
Playlist: RustCon Asia 2019
Description: 
	Rust strives to be an ergonomic language: easy to read, easy to write, and easy to maintain. We want it to be a language which delights! But what does that mean? How do the language and library designers decide what makes a feature ergonomic? And how do we consider the trade-offs between ergonomics and other design pressures such as safety and performance?

I’ll cover Rust’s design philosophy, some case studies on ergonomics from the language, libraries, and tools, and talk about how design decisions are made by the language team and others. I’ll talk about issues such as ‘explicit vs implicit’, syntactic sugar, and consistency.
