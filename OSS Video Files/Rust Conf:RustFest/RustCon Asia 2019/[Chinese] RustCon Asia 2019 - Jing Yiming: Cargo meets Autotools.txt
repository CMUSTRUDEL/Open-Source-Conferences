Title: [Chinese] RustCon Asia 2019 - Jing Yiming: Cargo meets Autotools
Publication date: 2019-05-01
Playlist: RustCon Asia 2019
Description: 
	Since 1.10, rustc can generate a dynamic library that is intended to be used from C or C FFI, as long as the cdylib crate type is specified in Cargo.toml. While the cargo install command makes it a breeze to distribute executables (e.g. ripgrep), it does NOT work with cdylib dynamic libraries.

Back in 2018 we had struggled a long way to get a working build infrastructure, just to build and distribute our dynamic library written in Rust. Eventually, we made autotools work happily together with the rust toolchain. Now a user can just download our source tarball, uncompress, and run ./configure && make && make install, just like old times. In this talk weâ€™d like to share our story and hopefully this will be useful for the community.
