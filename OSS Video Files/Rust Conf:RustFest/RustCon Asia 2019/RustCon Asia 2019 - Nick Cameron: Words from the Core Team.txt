Thank You Nick

00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,650
hello again this is a great start

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:20,220
I'm much happier than last time I'm

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:24,570
gonna talk today on behalf of the core

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,420
team and just say a few words about sue

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,070
think about where rust is right now and

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:34,079
where we hope rust is going to be going

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,239
over the next year but I I just want to

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,570
start by saying a few words about the

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,699
conference I've been having like a

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,609
really excellent time there's been some

00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:47,039
fantastic talks I'm just a really kind

00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:50,069
of diverse array of topics and that's

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,960
been a real pleasure to listen to and

00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:58,710
it's been really great to get to meet a

00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:00,329
lot of you yeah so although this is the

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,239
end of the technical program we have

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,729
there's a couple more days of workshops

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,440
to go and so I hope you'll get to stick

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,300
around it and enjoy some of those I know

00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,300
I'm looking forward to those as well

00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:21,360
yeah thank you this is okay and I just

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,160
want to say thank you there's so much

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,050
effort that goes into producing a

00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,270
conference like this and if everything

00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:33,750
goes well you don't really notice but I

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:37,770
it really takes a lot of hard work to

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,980
get a conference up and going so I want

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,250
to start by saying thank you to the

00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:47,280
organizers kryptek Minh and pink cap and

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,230
in particular to Amy and Anna who have

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,300
done like a huge amount of work behind

00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:55,940
the scenes to make all this work

00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,940
so thank you organizers

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:05,369
I know without the sponsors there would

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:11,149
be no conference so I am very

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,149
appreciative of the responses thank you

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:22,019
and the staff who are working here and

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,560
the translators and everyone who is

00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:27,180
given a talk or give a workshop and all

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,130
the attendees if there are no attendees

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,349
there is no conference so thank you for

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:40,709
giving up your weekend and coming to

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:43,650
listen to to rust and both personally

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,870
and behalf of the the kind of rust

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,690
leadership where I'm very happy that

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,500
this conferences is happening and

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:57,180
happening here I think that China and

00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:00,450
Asia have really large active rust

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,720
communities and it's really great that

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:07,230
there's a the we have the this

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,329
conference here now as well and this is

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,980
you know rust is getting more global

00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,859
more international just last month we

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,599
had the first conference in Latin

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:18,000
America at the end of last year the

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,620
first conference in Russia as well as

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,209
kind of some of the the slightly older

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,079
conferences going on in the US and

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,440
Europe and we've got and meetups are

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,930
happening now in 42 different countries

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,430
and just like this conference and just

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,519
like most of the other conferences these

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,209
are all kind of community driven

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:42,450
homegrown events and it's and it's just

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,010
really great that this is this is

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,489
happening

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,160
and I and I look forward for this

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,440
happening more and to have for kind of a

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,000
a better relationship between the

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,090
various kind of international Ross

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,010
communities and in fact that's one of

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,959
the key priorities for the community

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,910
team this year is to improve

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,400
internationalization and improve work

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,140
with the international communities but

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,060
I'm I'm getting ahead of myself talking

00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:15,340
about 2019 I will talk about 20

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:19,000
18 first so 20 18 was a good year we

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:25,419
released the 2018 Edition which was very

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,880
exciting this is a key part of rusts

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:32,860
policy of stability without stagnation

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,800
and what that means is we want rust to

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,730
keep improving to keep getting better

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:43,510
but we don't want to do that if it means

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:46,930
breaking your code and the the 2018

00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:49,030
edition is an opportunity for us to kind

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,860
of future-proof the next few years from

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:56,380
the improvements and kind of deprecated

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,520
some of the the stuff that probably

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,990
shouldn't have been there in the first

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,400
place but we've managed to do this

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,380
pretty much without breaking backwards

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,600
compatibility because it because you've

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:13,780
had to opt in to the 2018 edition and

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,630
even if you don't opt in then 2015

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,900
crates and 2018 crates can interoperate

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,100
very very smoothly you you don't need to

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,140
worry if one of your upstream

00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,910
dependencies is gone ahead to the 28th

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,510
in addition but you don't want to yet or

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:30,400
likewise you don't need to worry if if

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,580
your upstream crates does not moved on

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,360
to the 2080 in addition you can go ahead

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:41,229
with yours and if you do have breaking

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,120
changes there's a at all cargo fix which

00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:48,100
will help you address nearly all of

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:52,479
those automatically so what was actually

00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:55,479
in the 2018 edition I think it was quite

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,150
an exciting bunch of features on the

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,370
language side we we got non lexical

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,760
lifetimes which makes the Baro tracker

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:09,610
just a little bit less frustrating we

00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:14,110
added stable support for a not all but a

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:17,490
wide selection of procedural macros

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,200
which are an extremely powerful feature

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,120
we improved the ergonomics of match I

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,430
talked about this a little bit yesterday

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,710
and we made some improvements to the

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:31,419
module system so hopefully you won't

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:34,389
have to use x2 and crates anymore we

00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:37,780
shipped 1.0 versions of rus formats and

00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:42,100
Clippy which - very popular tools in the

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:47,530
in the rust ecosystem and we made great

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:49,540
progress on IDE support and we ship the

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,419
cargo fix tool that I just talked about

00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,810
without which I think the addition would

00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:59,080
have been a much harder sell like mod

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:04,720
much more friction in moving from 2015

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:06,550
to 2018 and we also had some domain

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,340
working groups focusing on the domains

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,660
web assembly embedded computing

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:17,710
command-line interfaces and networking

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:22,210
and all these domains make great

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:24,660
progress last year so overall my feeling

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,789
now is the rust is a working language

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,460
it's I mean it's still a relatively new

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:33,820
language but it doesn't feel like I've

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,150
really out there risky choice to make if

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,310
you're choosing a programming language

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,229
it's certainly not experimental anymore

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,090
it's certainly not a toy anymore it's

00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:49,020
it's a language you can get real work

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:51,639
done and the 2018 survey backs that up I

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,680
just want to talk about a few of the

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,169
highlights in the 2018 survey to give

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:01,289
you an idea of where the russ community

00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:05,169
is right now so we had responses from

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:07,840
6,000 people which is a new high and

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:11,370
it's great that the the number of

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,370
respondents is tracking up every year

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:19,449
30% of those respondents use rust

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:22,060
professionally at work and again this is

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:25,120
tracking up year-on-year so we see rust

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,849
being taken it's not just early adopters

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,490
kind of learning it in their own

00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:34,289
time it's you know a lot of people are

00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:36,329
using it to get work done and 25% to

00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:39,719
respondents working on code bases which

00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:41,909
are 10,000 lines or more which is kind

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,829
of like a medium to large a code base

00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,990
but this shows that like it's not just

00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:48,420
toys it's not just experiments or

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:54,000
prototypes we're getting work done on

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:59,339
serious projects this is a really

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,810
interesting chart to me this is how long

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,019
have you been working with rust and

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,750
what's interesting is that about a

00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,920
quarter about 25% respondents have been

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,899
using rust for two years or more and

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,600
approximately the same about 25% again

00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:18,870
who have been using rust for less than

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,569
three months and what that shows to me

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,819
is that we are still getting lots of new

00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:27,180
users lots of people are still coming to

00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:29,040
rust and at the same time lots of people

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,589
are still sticking around people are not

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,319
trying it for six months and moving on

00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:43,199
to you know the next hot language

00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:47,189
they're sticking with rust and I think

00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:50,970
the the the survey number I'm most proud

00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:53,670
of is this one is that only two percent

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,759
of respondents felt unwelcome in the

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,350
rust community and you know given what a

00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:02,240
lot of internet communities are like

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:07,230
this is a really great results I think

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,329
I'm much less proud that this this

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,810
number has a lot of regional variation

00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:16,139
so in China the number was 8% you know

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,689
it's a lot higher and I really hope that

00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:21,899
we can do better this year and going

00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:23,610
forward to try and get the the Chinese

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,589
community in particular kind of like

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:30,839
more part of the international community

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:35,750
and reading more welcome my final

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:38,380
highlight from the from the survey is

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,390
93% respondents

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,560
have never experienced a backward

00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:46,600
compatibility issue and given this core

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,770
principle that I mentioned earlier

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,720
stability without stagnation this is a

00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,790
really important part of that this is a

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,430
really big number of people who are

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:01,690
getting the guarantee that we want them

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:04,000
to get and the remaining 7% nearly all

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,410
of those were very minor easy to fix

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,050
problems we have very few people

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:11,980
complaining about like serious backwards

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:14,200
compatibility issues so it sounds great

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:21,190
so we can head to the beach get a book

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:24,520
time to relax no we we we've still got a

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:27,730
lot to do and there's still a lot of

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:31,380
improvements we can make and so let's

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:36,850
talk about 2019 there we recently

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:39,010
accepted an RFC laying out the 2019

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:44,200
roadmap and there will be a blog post

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:46,870
about that hopefully next week the

00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,110
overall theme for for 2019 is about

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,360
maturity and I mentioned earlier that I

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,910
feel like rust is feeling like a warm

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,160
you know mature language where you can

00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,910
get serious work done and we want to

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,640
take that even further it's time to

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:09,070
really kind of like make using rust

00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:15,550
serious thing and part of that is taking

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:17,890
some time and reflecting on ways in

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,190
which we can set us up to continue to

00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:24,100
grow and continue to do so in a in a

00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,530
good way rather than kind of losing some

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,830
of the good things that we have at the

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:33,040
moment and a key part of that is about

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:36,460
governance how is the project run how

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,910
what are the the leadership structures

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:42,760
because of the last three years

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:45,370
rust is grown in immensely it's a it's

00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,960
got a huge number of users now and we

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,980
have to make our governance structures

00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,300
scale with the growth of the community

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:56,590
an example of this is the iris

00:12:52,300 --> 00:13:00,160
process the RFC process is great it

00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,270
means that we can do all of our design

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,760
work in the open

00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,970
nearly every decision that or every

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,160
significant decision which is made in

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,820
the RUS project is made via the RC

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,700
process and is made in the open but

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:19,720
we've gone through nearly 13-hundred

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:22,030
RFC's since that we we started the

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,330
process around kind of 1.0 time just

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:27,880
before 1.0 and like we've well past the

00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,520
point where one person can keep track of

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,340
every RFC discussion in fact we're

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,380
pretty much part past the point where

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:38,230
you can keep an eye on say all the

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,420
language axes or all the library RFC's

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,640
even if you're working full-time on rust

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,420
which a great number of people in the

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:50,200
community aren't and even if you want to

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,820
focus on just like a few prod rfcs some

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,880
of the discussions you know we've seen

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,130
nearly seven hundred comments that's

00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,920
that's a lot of discussion to keep track

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:05,470
of and so this year we really need to

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,040
grow some new ways of doing things we

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:12,850
need to develop new processes create new

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,530
teams new working groups re-evaluate how

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:21,370
the existing teams and working groups

00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:25,120
are growing and evolving we also want to

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:27,760
address long-standing requests there are

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,870
some items that have been around in some

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,810
cases since before 1.0 and that we know

00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:39,430
basically how to fix them but we just

00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:43,330
haven't got around to fixing them here's

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:46,720
a list of some of the things on our mind

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:50,520
so custom allocators this is a big

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,700
demand for people writing large systems

00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,030
especially more low-level projects

00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,870
async/await

00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:00,580
for asynchronous programming I probably

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,000
don't say anything about that it's a

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,779
it's a pretty well-known feature by now

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,889
constant generics generic associate

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:12,519
type specialisation these are all kind

00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:15,230
of big-ticket language items they're all

00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,389
the design is pretty much done for all

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,009
all of these things in most cases the

00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:20,240
implementation is pretty much done we

00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:24,230
just need to get some of the wrinkles

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,110
out and stabilize it and custom

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,930
registries in cargo is another

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:34,329
big-ticket item that we we need to get

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:39,230
done and the third theme for the year is

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:41,420
polish although by now you know the the

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,430
shape of rust is really set we're not

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,649
gonna see any big changes right we're

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,839
not gonna announce this year that we're

00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:51,319
giving up on ownership and the garbage

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:55,629
collection is the way forward but there

00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:58,309
are like lots of places where we can

00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:02,240
polish some more rough edges off we can

00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:08,509
make things better IDE support compile

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:10,639
times documentation ergonomics and and

00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,559
so on and so forth so there's a lot of

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,809
places that I can hope we can make small

00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:23,990
but significant improvements okay that's

00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:25,939
everything that I have I I help you of

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,360
kind of excited for what's gonna happen

00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:31,970
this year I know that I am and I hope

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,839
you in are able to attend some of the

00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,399
workshops and enjoy those and please if

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,139
any of this stuff is interesting come

00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:43,029
find me over the next couple of days and

00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:43,029
have a chat thank you very much

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,180
you

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:54,440
I'm a volunteer and I have I have a last

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,959
technical question and really quick as a

00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:01,520
core team member can you recommend an

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:04,790
IDE or text editor for the rest of the

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:08,929
russ committee because you know the the

00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:12,559
IDE for rust is not it's less mature

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:15,199
than the other language like um or Java

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,860
so what should you recommend for the

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,980
rest of us I I would recommend using the

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,800
editor you like I I know that if I tell

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:29,150
Annie max user to use vim or vim user to

00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:33,230
use Emacs it won't be popular if if you

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:37,490
like a very full-featured IDE then

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:40,940
IntelliJ has great support for rust a

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:43,640
lot of the IntelliJ features that are

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:46,580
available for say Java or Scala whatever

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:50,840
you you get for rust as well if you like

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:53,690
a more lightweight IDE vs code is pretty

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,690
good I mean it's a fantastic editor and

00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:02,150
the rust support is pretty good if you

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:04,970
have a fairly small project I am a big

00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:08,840
fan of more lightweight editors like

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:11,870
sublime text or Adam both of which have

00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,730
kind of syntax highlighting and can

00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,070
support that they are LS if you like

00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:18,530
having more information like that around

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,110
but really like choosing an editor is

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,900
such a personal choice that I wouldn't

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:26,480
recommend one over another I'd say more

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,360
stick to the Odyssey you'd like and the

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,460
the support will be there maybe not you

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,190
know as good as you're used to and Java

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:37,809
or something but there's there's stuff

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,809
there thank you so much

00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,150
[Applause]

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,480
just just a super-short question is

00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:56,030
Ferris going to be an official mascot

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:59,150
deliberately no it's because kind of

00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:02,980
logos and trademarks and so off it's so

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:07,550
on it gets very boring and legal and

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:09,710
it's nice to have a mascot which is not

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,390
official and with which you can do

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,580
whatever you like so if you want to make

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,700
your own version of Ferris knock

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:21,500
yourself out like go ahead make your own

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:25,900
toy make badges whatever we yeah it's it

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:28,220
is the russ community logo it's not

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:35,230
official in any kind of legally

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:35,230
meaningful way okay there you go that's

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:45,620
fantastic talk I'm pretty excited for at

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:48,470
Zone 1904 rust so one of the problems

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,050
that I often face at my workplace which

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:54,500
is really just me what using rust right

00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:57,680
now is how exactly do I introduce rust

00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:03,770
to my colleagues do you have any tips

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:07,390
for that I can point you at a great talk

00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:10,250
all about that that I think is on

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:13,880
YouTube I think

00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,800
I will have to look it up but yeah I

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,170
think there was a talk at Ruskin last

00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,990
year about this or maybe the the year

00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:22,490
before like going into some a bunch of

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,210
stuff that works and a bunch of stuff

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:29,260
that might not work it I think it

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:32,390
depends very much who you're trying to

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:36,580
sell it to I would say very different

00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:42,440
things to your CTO versus like another

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:44,210
engineer but kind of the I mean the the

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,670
kind of like the higher-order bit is

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:50,720
that if you need performance and if you

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:53,060
need you know low memory usage or you

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,720
can't tolerate garbage collection then

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:59,780
rust will make you much more productive

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,370
than other languages by using rust

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,880
you'll have write less bugs you will

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:09,580
spend less time debugging and that is a

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,580
