Title: [Chinese] RustCon Asia 2019 - Zimon Dai: Distributed Actor System in Rust
Publication date: 2019-05-01
Playlist: RustCon Asia 2019
Description: 
	We designed our distributed actor system in Rust. This kind of system involves many problems as Rust is strong-typed with neither a VM nor reflection. This lecture shares our approach to create such a system. Also shares how to erase type information to do networking and recover the type for messaging in Rust. And other unique design patterns including how to dynamically create new actor types and inject into the system (using proc macros).
