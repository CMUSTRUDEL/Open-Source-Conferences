	Note: Looking for English subtitle contribution.

Competitive programming requires you to solve problems efficiently and correctly in a very short time. Since there is not a single library that designed for competitive programming, contenders often have to implement non-trivial data-structures and algorithms from scratch which tedious and error-prone. This talk is about why Rust is a good fit for making libraries for competitive programming and how.
