Title: [Chinese] RustCon Asia 2019 - Sun Mingshen: Linux From Scratch in Rust
Publication date: 2019-05-01
Playlist: RustCon Asia 2019
Description: 
	Rustâ€™s memory-safety and zero-abstraction makes it the best candidate for system programming. To provide a safe execution environment, we build a Linux distribution from scratch in Rust including a building system, user-space utilities, and a simple package management system. In this talk, we mainly focus on our user-space toolbox, which is a collection of core system utilities. We will discuss some design challenges and problems we encountered in building the toolbox, e.g., handling standard I/O, dynamic dispatching vs static generic type, testing and coverage issues, etc.
