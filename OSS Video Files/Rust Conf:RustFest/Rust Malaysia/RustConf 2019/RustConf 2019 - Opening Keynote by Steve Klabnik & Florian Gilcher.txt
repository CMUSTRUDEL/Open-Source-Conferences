	RustConf 2019 - Opening Keynote by Steve Klabnik & Florian Gilcher

Rust has wild years behind it: we released Rust 1.0 just a little over 4 years ago. We released 37 stable versions of the compiler and countless other releases. Edition 2018 happened. async/await is finally here! And this is not counting the uptake of general crates!

We're successful! Indeed, the Rust programming language and project are some of fastest growing globally. But Edition 2018 also was a breakpoint: it was a common goal to work towards. That is now gone.

With the explosive growth also comes a growing understanding of our processes and community, but also growing unclarity. Steve and Florian will share their thoughts on the last year(s) and especially on the future. This keynote wants to encourage you to form your own and grow a common understanding how to carve our way forward!
