	RustConf 2019 - Class Fixes; Or, You Become the Rust Compiler by Isobel Redelmeier

What's a "class fix"? Well, a class break is a is a security term for a type of vulnerability that breaks not just a single instance (e.g., a single database), but instead a whole category of systems (e.g., all MySQL databases). Let's think of class fixes, then, as the happy opposite: one solution that addresses a whole slew of problems - much like Rust does by enforcing code correctness so strictly.

We'll go on a tour of the Rust features that provide us with class fixes, such as our dear, persistent friend, the borrow checker. But let's not stop there! Learning Rust can help train you to think more like the Rust compiler. We'll turn that into your new superpower, so that you can start applying the same rigor to even your non-Rust projects.

Expect to walk a way with a better toolkit for holistic debugging and system design!
