	RustConf 2019 - Syscalls for Rustaceans by Gargi Sharma

Even if you haven't used Rust's nix package, and have just written println!("Hello, World!"), you have most certainly used syscalls. Syscalls are an interface between the operating system and a user program.

strace can be used to debug git performance issues, examining internals of closed source programs, sandboxing programs and is a powerful debugging tool under your arsenal. This talk explains what syscalls are, how they work, how you can track them using strace and how you can write your own syscall tracer (strace) in Rust!
