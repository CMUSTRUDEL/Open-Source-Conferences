	RustConf 2019 - Bringing Rust Home to Meet the Parents by Jeremy Fitzhardinge

How can you bring your love for Rust to your organization, and how can you set it up for success?

Facebook has a ton of code written in a lot of languages. Is there room for Rust? Yes! This talk covers my journey of discovery integrating Rust into a large existing software ecosystem while trying to preserve all of Rust’s nice properties. Writing, building, testing, third-party code, foreign bindings, debugging, deployment, monitoring all need to be re-examined in the light of this new environment. How did we go from nothing to a core production service in Rust?

No two orgs are alike - you’ll walk away with a practical set of questions you’ll need to consider for your org (and maybe some answers).
