year so then okay so Lester so we begin

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,970
with some sites showing the latest news

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:40,000
and stuff on Russ Mina Malaysia anything

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,000
I miss it all

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:55,160
Amanda okay so here we have the Obsidian

00:07:51,670 --> 00:08:06,490
so first one is the oxygen with the

00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:15,280
religion of CDN chewy like like less

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:18,370
okay okay so the oxygen is one of the

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,670
the peoples from Malaysia that do this

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:25,430
no me but some some other guy Joong Ki

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,590
and them in his friends they were doing

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,190
trying out building web frameworks so

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:34,700
and then got release the first one point

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,740
one out your father first alpha then

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,740
they just released it this like a few

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,540
this right one week one week ago then

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,210
they were they were trying out like they

00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,390
were inspired by other framework one

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,710
your tryout reading for Muslims yeah

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,690
[Music]

00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:53,210
they just there are some parts of their

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:59,830
worker but he's not joining on me about

00:08:53,210 --> 00:09:02,600
this time then I tried shaking then I

00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,360
saw them doing something different okay

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,820
besides the usual the user

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,820
Rasim that framework right have like a

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,370
fake rocket they use the HDP create but

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:17,300
I saw that he's not using it so I feel

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,580
weird then because usually the HTTPS

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,950
type check or if they're put in the

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,500
wrong with you is check unless you put

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,240
in custom header and because he's not

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,790
using the HTTP he just using the string

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,740
so she has like quite different kind of

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,090
different API then of course there will

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,220
be different things so I discussed I

00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:37,000
seem that he they're all here you know

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,890
that the HTTP there's a great cause DP

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,440
they you can do all these haters stuff

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:46,130
like you can specify what kind of haters

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:50,030
to be so it allows the company to allows

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:53,710
to leverage the lyric empower power to a

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,710
check back do the static type checking

00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:17,860
let us have like mostly outside standard

00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:19,570
I really you and a random quit you can

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,120
if you search true then you know that

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:27,310
the pipe quality the community

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:30,339
recommender awesome rest yes you can go

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:32,589
to offer mass or you can even go to

00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:35,279
Chris the they would have a ranking of

00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:41,380
the crates that do these kind of things

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:53,440
let's say oh there is a Roscoe Roscoe

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:55,800
but maybe a show so there's a rascal can

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,800
see ya

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,760
so they're they have like algorithms how

00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:12,220
to generate random numbers something

00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:15,610
like like oh then okay they talk about

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,350
like how to generate random numbers you

00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:21,280
can even search I that you want to do

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,780
some something like network so how to do

00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,310
a server then they also give some

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:30,220
suggestion or like how to how to do like

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:35,980
listen on the networking pot but this

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:39,250
way it's a bit viola like yeah that the

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,860
woman is lower now compared to not the

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,940
active even like you saw some in a pull

00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,660
request you would take like some time

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:50,740
for them to response each table yes if

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:54,340
they go this this works but what people

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:58,180
like to see is the most of the rest

00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,890
crater which 1.0 but there are people at

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,270
people the one they don't they don't do

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,300
do breaking change - it doesn't reach

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:06,250
100 so people thing is not stable but at

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,500
the end they are quite stable then I

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:13,180
don't I never seen that rust great so

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,920
far let's say let's say the petrol

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,020
engine improving I never seen that yet

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:22,110
even minor water I don't I don't see

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:25,210
break even some critics like Tokyo

00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,660
because Tokyo they're 0.1 and your

00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,390
country

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,560
okay I buy a liter so basically they

00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:34,980
Steven compatibility great for that and

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,980
it coming back

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:54,290
so then okay during this time there's

00:12:44,450 --> 00:13:00,680
release for rust 1.40 okay wait wait can

00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:05,540
see that's one point four zero so yes

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:08,210
its new coming you coming so the new

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:11,900
thing is there is non-exhaustive like

00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:14,180
straps announced and various what this

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,670
does is that you can just you just put a

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:20,870
non-exhaustive like on top of the match

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:23,150
right then no way when you on top of the

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:26,030
front when you declare from enums so

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:28,220
that you know grass have non matching

00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:30,290
matching right there's a mesh they

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,680
Meniere's it's like coming if you never

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:36,740
use rust is something that you are

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,750
higher fish but more powerful search you

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,190
can do that almost

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,280
you can even match that instant data

00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:48,530
type inside and if you use this it

00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:51,080
allows you to you must you must have

00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:53,480
some logic to handle something this

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,090
means that there might be something

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,220
future that can add stuff to the

00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,650
struggle in a more so you need to handle

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,320
for their so right now you can just put

00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,230
an underscore to well cut 100 a so

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,300
because you don't even a developer

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,890
stands out they don't know what so this

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,300
is U so you so when you're doing and I

00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,030
breathe is new and then you don't want

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,730
them to to see that just match this time

00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:22,820
so and then when I better break so this

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:24,410
allows you yes but some cases they might

00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,110
want to do this because sometimes

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,750
they're just let's say in a compiler you

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:42,520
have the different kinds of start

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:42,520
they're like okay let's say

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,379
[Music]

00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:01,110
now is to catch all of them but some

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,790
strange case let's say you have arrow

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,640
cause you want to match all the arrow

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:07,020
cause that's a one or two zero cost you

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:24,030
don't you don't care about handling goes

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:26,960
right so we can just add them so martini

00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,960
the solid just

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,880
this is just allow them to do so bad I

00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,280
don't think this much required anywhere

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,640
usually they just think you know we find

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,930
a nexus tomorrow and attribute

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,330
improvements so now you can do more

00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,650
things in Macomb but I probably won't

00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,860
talk about eat here because it's like

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:40,850
probably no one here I think maybe use

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,350
macro on a very deep level so this one

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,360
just allows them to do more stuff like

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:49,640
you can let's say you can run the macro

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:52,460
inside you can use a macro for let's say

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,940
a consumable you can use a macro for

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:59,390
there it's not just at like and few more

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:01,910
there's a lot of capabilities there then

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,230
but then probably I won't talk here

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:08,300
because it might be too deep

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:12,320
maybe yeah so you just add something I

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:16,700
love the deuce macro in Annihilus a

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,640
constant consumables and there and some

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,370
others as well where I didn't check mash

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,830
then and next is in your own vertical

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,820
you know what's in your alright the non

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:31,220
lexicalized time it's like last time the

00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:35,300
the oberoi circle they are quite like a

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,470
bit limit on let's say the some case

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:40,540
that is correct

00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,540
you know that the lifetime is correct

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,520
you

00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,779
just healthy or to lose muscle or

00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,419
features they've not yet implemented but

00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:14,370
you're going to do so and implemented is

00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:16,110
I the code that you are probably not

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,860
going to implement it and not implement

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:26,100
it yet even one more but there is not

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:28,230
added yet and there yes yes they runtime

00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,460
panics so this is where you spewed in

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,169
terms when you're building stuff you

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,480
hump you everything you explain a

00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:35,100
function to return this output value

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:44,490
dinner you return output so Russell

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:46,649
error yeah yeah you can do that better

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:59,159
sometimes you want to do those is very

00:22:46,649 --> 00:23:00,870
troublesome couponing when it hits the

00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,700
to do usual you're on the test untrue

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,470
that to do so it helps when you're

00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,809
developing your under test out what is

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:34,529
currently there so you just put through

00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:37,789
there you're just panic if you don't do

00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:40,289
that then you you cannot even run it

00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:46,679
there's eridan rest will stop you from

00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:50,820
doing this you can you can just panic

00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:53,059
then run to do there or Russ will know

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,059
that

00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:26,060
to do at the time of implementation to

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,970
do is exactly the same just copy paste

00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:31,670
it to and pivot now it's a bit different

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:34,910
for the wordings you said the reason why

00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:36,740
they do to do is because to do is easier

00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,560
to type just for her actors and another

00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,560
reason why they do it is because there

00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,570
is these it works with the IDE better

00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,760
like the editor so if you see to do

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:51,590
right they highlight so that's the other

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:54,590
reason I do it just like that yeah lefty

00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:58,120
side starts repeat I repeat just slices

00:24:54,590 --> 00:25:00,860
like array array but they just repeat it

00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:05,330
slices you know you know the size

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:08,090
slicing some like Jose is you go you can

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,500
cut every in other languages are people

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,860
you can also call it Aaron

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,200
rust but people usually use slice even a

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,080
standard be the prettiest place so what

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,760
this does is you can repeat the array

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,370
multiple times and then it becomes a

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,520
vector like this different from array in

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:28,700
terms of let's say vector is located in

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,070
the heap there's like less web factor

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,680
but we don't want go into the versus

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,970
other critter provider vector is our

00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:46,880
chip and slice is on the stack usually

00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:51,100
then I think I think that already

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,100
supposed to repeat like that I think yes

00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:23,000
no I really slice and then main thing is

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:26,540
just like a safe safe way to just take a

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,630
value from from with the teenager and I

00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:32,050
say you have option then you just take

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,010
the value they will become now

00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:39,550
yes I mean I dare you just take the

00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:41,000
value inside 20 then you you become like

00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:51,350
replaceable de father

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:53,420
so default option is none yes that's so

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,280
you after you take the value out you can

00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,280
eat meat turn the value you get a value

00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,830
and then the origin no variable you

00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:16,190
become you become the default value so

00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:20,140
you just agree well yes he needs to be

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,140
with a Baba I didn't for the mute

00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,529
[Music]

00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,450
you

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,720
just like that then next is option SDRF

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,639
I just realized this that people are

00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,409
using it I thought why is this I don't

00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:47,830
know why this when I see the release

00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:49,960
notes

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,019
now I saw inside of Kampala easier when

00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,729
I'm contributing stuff then I saw people

00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:57,669
telling me all to change these a good

00:29:54,729 --> 00:30:01,869
additionally also by the way then this

00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:05,350
one is like you can come with a pipe to

00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:07,960
the internal you you keep the outer

00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:11,349
memory then you just take that inside as

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,070
the just the rest just near after it

00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:14,799
later

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:17,559
the inner data just take it out like

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:21,460
what this can do is you see a second I

00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:24,129
think it's s ref dot map giraffe so

00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,759
sometimes you after you do as well then

00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:33,970
you want to get the develop value right

00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:38,369
or the other one Express map then MSN

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:42,429
star star x1 is also doing the ref

00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:46,090
together value and the ref so this can

00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:51,159
replace those and you can just get the

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:54,929
derivative of the inner value without

00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:57,970
doing the long run to the two methods

00:30:54,929 --> 00:31:01,539
like oh just just a note that there's

00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:04,470
also as ref by this different stress is

00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:10,210
different from sd ref because Ashraf you

00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:14,769
come with a final mystical now you come

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:17,200
with call that higher then yes options

00:31:14,769 --> 00:31:19,179
happen let's say the next rise often

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,009
threatened is I just you have a lot of

00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:27,429
option option Sam Sam Sam Sam value oh

00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:29,379
you're Sam Sam Sam Sam Sam Nunn the end

00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:31,690
if you flip it like if you have Sun Sun

00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:34,629
Sun and then you become and if you're

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:38,229
some sometimes when you then you become

00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:42,149
the when you family yeah you just bet on

00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:42,149
the option decide then

00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:49,640
yes then okay the next one so we done

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,710
talking about library stabilize your

00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:55,760
next one is the Russ game death we can

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:57,800
grow have your CDs so this new working

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,180
group like since last August so it's

00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,180
quite new the only four doors

00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:08,330
[Laughter]

00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:10,670
so I think the applicant or we gave me

00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:14,000
about not yet so the the right

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:16,010
interesting games such as the the post

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,210
news on interesting games that's so long

00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:22,340
I read one by one by one right just one

00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:26,570
this one block is that so long the block

00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:28,460
is a block toward this up top so you can

00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,350
I don't think I can finish it reading at

00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,780
you anyone did you go side the one block

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:35,960
the contest so many other block and so

00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:37,280
many other there that docks they're

00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,310
talking about how they design a game

00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:43,280
what did they faced by the top the dog

00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:45,740
just do a summary of those so basically

00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,840
this way in Russ except this this year

00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,030
ass the motion so many things except the

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,750
things machining things first a very

00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:56,060
huge they only push a DS game dev team

00:32:53,750 --> 00:33:08,180
and they also a speed up the development

00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:12,430
that the only one speed I'm not sure I

00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:15,410
think this whole mix mixture we worst

00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:18,410
most game that I saw the blog post is

00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:22,700
open source some like paid games but not

00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:25,880
all so just like neutral interesting

00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:29,750
games like water on whatever is our game

00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,070
like that you can fly the world my

00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,630
friend saying it looks like cute lobe I

00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,180
don't know why skip wall so I cannot say

00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:38,960
much so it's a game Minecraft I can fly

00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:40,880
very big cute well you say that then you

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,610
can find one suicide the same posting

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:48,140
game then they also ever get blog post I

00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:51,200
write ups and introduce new crates if

00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,850
you have business to eat crisps for

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,980
Kindle money is really

00:33:52,850 --> 00:34:01,490
know what Jeff graphics how they a

00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:03,440
fraction library GFX KL they replaced I

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,110
GFX something wrong or what and the

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,450
remember by the defender library the the

00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,609
metro and neural matter design and

00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:13,040
abstracts or different diverse in

00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:16,359
different platforms and the budget view

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,669
is a GPU thing at something like that

00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:21,379
alright Cena then this meeting minis

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:22,760
meeting anyone can join the army nice

00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:25,339
meeting of course you can also join

00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,349
other other gross minis meeting like the

00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:29,720
you won't post the meeting when don't do

00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:33,470
they meet online then they meet online

00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:37,550
you can you enjoin even the your teens

00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:41,419
meeting you can join like if you join

00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,829
the rid of course into Nora's they stock

00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:44,139
discount meeting their plan for future

00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:48,500
meeting you can just join everything

00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:57,020
everyone can join the blue chip is for

00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:59,540
web yes yes I'm not sure where they

00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:12,650
works on desktop or others but I know it

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:13,400
made me forget sweat no no this is a

00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,329
library

00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:20,690
no I think maybe being users OpenCL but

00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:23,960
I'm not sure you about it but they are

00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:24,740
not we are not yeah but it's not like

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,349
something like that

00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:32,660
if library to use those and then yeah

00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:34,430
this just looks like between wrath they

00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,079
just take a lot from this meter s that

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,950
you would have the thing that in this

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,700
universe

00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:49,430
obviously Russ is a system language for

00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:52,540
targeting the traffic bar speed a yeah

00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:55,040
fifty speed safety concurrency and speed

00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:58,130
yes they are they also say this thing

00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,970
and then they say he aligns to them that

00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:03,980
I hope you will all say this next is

00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,780
that they're just so many games I didn't

00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,619
try all of them but yeah they are going

00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,900
to take

00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:11,960
they're going to our game yet if you

00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,910
know I will give me a new game reports

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,940
the state of the game there's also a

00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:26,930
really web yet are we saying yeah re IDE

00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:28,069
yet re what we first year is it now when

00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,339
i refresh the I think it's for

00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:34,130
compilation speed but if everywhere this

00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:35,749
also are we for you decide whether this

00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:45,910
one politicized by the are really

00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:49,039
something yet okay then yeah is similar

00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:55,460
but this is focusing on games I think so

00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:58,099
father or amateur getting up etc and

00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:03,380
then down they just I won I take your

00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:05,329
son screenshot of the next talk about

00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:09,200
attics where they released to find you

00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:11,450
wish users so there's so many referrals

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,160
are not like specifically just want to

00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:18,170
advertise this but most of them provides

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,329
after the eye thing release I think

00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,049
await releases the most of them wanted

00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:24,619
us about that

00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:27,980
most of them going go raw rough day so

00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:30,499
they just pry DISA and say expects is

00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:34,460
one of them yes quite popular there's

00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:37,609
also rocket and others and I high then

00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:40,009
this one user site the part use of

00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:42,079
anything away and this huge structure

00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:45,769
changes if you know that the code there

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:51,309
you can see like the transparent person

00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:51,309
one the it looks more like rocket now

00:37:51,940 --> 00:38:00,200
yeah it looks it looks more like rocket

00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:03,079
then it also have a runtime now that

00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,480
active RT gives us a runtime but the

00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:09,670
speed still quite good you if you check

00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,670
the speed the the mesh map right

00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:19,780
if you don't know why this text is

00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:23,590
similar to is similar to rocket the

00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:27,520
because if you look at my accept the new

00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:29,830
stable kampala rocket use nightly the SP

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,340
is - okay I guess that time we are going

00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:35,640
to over them and some some people don't

00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,830
like it they'll just say rocket cheat no

00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:43,000
gun dragon

00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:45,250
and then now I think it would be yeah so

00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,310
this one is a one of the first one but I

00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,470
think they lost in a few just to talk

00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:53,950
about still not always number one

00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,360
already so this one this pure gun is not

00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:59,430
your see possible from this just

00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,840
suddenly come up and else become so fast

00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:06,700
yeah and if you want to see other Jason

00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,300
serialization it's not at the top yeah I

00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,830
see it

00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:16,000
alright nine - okay

00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:18,370
multiple curries I think the yeah this

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,850
update defines I or your CDs don't know

00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:25,900
what happen okay they are pseudo single

00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:30,060
curry yeah this is just this one however

00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:32,590
released yet this is the PFP the

00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:35,230
impoverishment but this one is like

00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:38,560
something and I leave you it's not

00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:39,910
official off you're sure that last run

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,830
is wrong it in they have a really strong

00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:48,300
right here this one just a nightly view

00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:48,300
you can see like the progress okay next

00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:01,450
yes

00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:04,470
oh let out discuss a plan then next is

00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:07,060
learn resident dangerous way this one is

00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:11,650
something like I can see quite a mini

00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:14,290
book they just usually there's there's a

00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,870
book write the book called Ross

00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:20,680
programming language bow it shows how to

00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:22,390
use rescue how to get the numerous using

00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,500
and stay for us from cifras perfect

00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:29,080
perspective then the teach about I let's

00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,800
say how from if you are coming from a

00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,760
Python Ruby and other developers then

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,200
you might think the

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,920
book is good but people are coming from

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,200
sita's sheep as well see the design is

00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,920
rooting away so they of course they are

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:48,640
used to unsafe and safety and soundness

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,260
but maybe on safety so they're used to

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,180
that when they come in they say Oh

00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:55,480
happen is so different so this is an

00:40:52,180 --> 00:41:00,790
initiative to this auto-release to let

00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:03,370
people from the sea will know then the

00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:06,970
so at first they take a sea convert into

00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:10,510
Russ then I'll end product less 95

00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:12,250
percent safe for us they say 7 step now

00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:16,540
6 step and now getting to stay one step

00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:18,190
and and you but just an spoiler each

00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:21,460
step and that's not the spot for each

00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,680
step each step uses more safe stay for

00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:26,710
us f+ it's all unsafe learn more safe

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,800
Russ and each step gets faster and

00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:32,260
cleaner more rusty and yeah just a

00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,700
spider you then the link is down there

00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,550
you can you can just wash these are

00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:39,840
quite just quite step by step tutorial

00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:42,730
there they they take that n-body GGC it

00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:46,230
from the benchmark games if you know

00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:49,930
that the programming language mark game

00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:53,730
so did something like simulator for the

00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:59,560
you knew for the what universe or what

00:41:53,730 --> 00:42:03,490
simulator for the tennis from maybe then

00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:06,730
f is cool probably this one I didn't

00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,180
show later Swick 3 1 0 because that's

00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,730
too long

00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:13,000
design is quite nice and suddenly what

00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:15,580
happened when and 50 goes wrong by Ellis

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,640
Rao maybe I think I pronounce the name

00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:21,310
correctly so she's one users

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,230
we're helpful regular just keep helping

00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,610
posting solving other people's problem

00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,360
if you have problem you can just post a

00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:30,490
rush users and she myself it may be so

00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:35,410
if you know that and say on some nasty

00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:38,890
side bet and 50 you can get undefined

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:41,920
behavior for you be so and city goes and

00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:44,980
and sound right and Satan goes wrong

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,170
something's wrong unsafe when you get on

00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,920
Seba yeah so

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:54,790
additional reading publish also rasmalai

00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,710
shellfish the burger problem like last

00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,280
time we discussed the broker for a video

00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:03,510
and publish it

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,510
now now if a BG just for ourself huh

00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:10,480
yeah I put it on the group then I even

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:14,079
and even put it to a dispute as well and

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,670
yet you say oh you know and then the

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,680
second one is a light like you're

00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:21,490
talking about lifetime and it'll realist

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:25,569
on the niche one Amisha one wishes are

00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:27,700
talking about like let's say voila it's

00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:32,619
not the usual lifetime so inside they're

00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:35,290
talking about imple impl impl Torito

00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:38,099
except there's an end you can see a plus

00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:50,369
some lifetime right there's okay my bad

00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:55,930
yes yeah and and so this one is just I

00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:58,510
think the book already mention data and

00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:01,180
next way I just thought oh nice today

00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:03,180
just people want to translate quick

00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,609
create or us using sheet roster just

00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:09,160
transport a transporter convert it and

00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:10,770
then they want to play they do a few

00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,569
modifications after their converse may

00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:19,930
mean either with the Goebbels or with

00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:22,750
the SSE stuff yeah so next coming soon

00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:27,099
you're good and NP talking about nice

00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:30,160
and start the slice so just talking that

00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:33,250
we will be hosting a rest bookshop in

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,530
mush yeah so what maybe I will tell the

00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,630
Singapore guys I heard someone they are

00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:43,420
interested to come over so I just ping

00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:46,589
them so if you want can find mash I'm

00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:53,470
not sure depending

00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:55,599
by the location in a few if you yes you

00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:59,970
will came by the transport

00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,970
yeah we you can just pick Bella

00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:12,430
so 1000 it already

00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:25,839
how oh go so fast

00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:25,839
yeah go faster Oh Gigi you go faster

00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,010
okay so Russ I think I'm going faster

00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:36,760
now

00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:40,030
so some introduction nobody is quite

00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:43,120
long I think I from two to two videos in

00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:46,920
I immerse them and pass some of my own

00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:50,440
and just reduction dressing yeah

00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:53,140
very slow yeah some production testing

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,360
everything is parallel so this one is

00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:58,210
ticking for another or so there you need

00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:00,430
to get light no for me too I think

00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:02,260
there's a there's this parallel

00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:05,950
concurrent and secrets what were they

00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:08,800
parallel is me it's just yeah let's hear

00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:12,310
multiple servers yeah multiple Witter

00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,930
then each person issue each way to

00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:17,350
handle multiple people just like that

00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:19,270
then concurrent is that you have yeah

00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:21,790
one meter but you can one person can do

00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:24,070
multiple jobs and a synchronous is

00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:26,950
actually I mean I read that this is like

00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:31,750
a different thing but kind of similar in

00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:34,230
a way so parallel like this a whole a

00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:38,470
take some customer be picks and customer

00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:41,320
the illustration and then concurrent is

00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:43,840
a take multiple customer from left and

00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:48,700
right so it will say so he can switch

00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:50,350
context switch so before your content we

00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,390
will be talking about that then there's

00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:56,410
a green crest we have we ask native

00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:58,690
tracks green test grants it's like gold

00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:01,800
gold crash screen test in a Detroiter i

00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:05,320
one-to-one with crescendo by the kernel

00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:09,010
then green crest we can see is

00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:11,470
lightweight but maybe show it's simpler

00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:14,500
so rust used to have a green fest but

00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:17,170
now before 1.0 but now they don't have

00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,870
our next unit rest

00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:22,540
yes needed chess so other languages

00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,260
other languages we as these synchronous

00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,530
asynchronous

00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:28,090
docking and undocking so let's go Ruby

00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:32,110
on a synchronous but non-blocking site

00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:34,450
and a synchronous and asynchronous no G

00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,310
is the no js' but it's also not working

00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,920
asynchronous might be a few weird when

00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:41,980
developing in the other control force an

00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,269
Iberia Berube last time usually then we

00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,759
shut off if the bookings

00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:47,939
Kronus Oscar administer and then later

00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:50,919
off they go to a synchrotron talking

00:47:47,939 --> 00:47:53,829
nice I think I also do that so just a

00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:57,549
bit of history your shiny 15 so native

00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:59,439
tree has green treads so they released

00:47:57,549 --> 00:48:02,049
that they are both at first they're both

00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:03,219
then later they released rust 1.0

00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:05,799
without green dress

00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:08,559
so because the thing we interest no the

00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:12,999
season tread is simpler alliance with

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:15,369
just what the scenario should provide so

00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:19,569
they're just really did without that and

00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:24,729
then oh goes 2016 2016 have we have to

00:48:19,569 --> 00:48:27,909
assure 0.1 release so if you want to see

00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:34,929
what future 0.1 they have this code is

00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:38,169
like there's the code side is you see so

00:48:34,929 --> 00:48:43,019
the yellow side is this you get a lot

00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:43,019
and then and then and then then map and

00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:52,899
yeah so there's the map and 2017 by the

00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:54,759
trainee 61 the futures Europe and one in

00:48:52,899 --> 00:48:57,189
my view sometimes when you want to speed

00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:58,630
you're going to merge them out speed

00:48:57,189 --> 00:49:01,029
them and then come back together

00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:04,389
you might feel well I do that I also got

00:49:01,029 --> 00:49:07,059
accurate I don't know why i'm sanna you

00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:10,329
get confused easily so the end they talk

00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:13,269
about 26 the intro RFC for experimental

00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:15,609
routines which introduced a stack stack

00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:18,459
those call routines which is the quality

00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:20,289
are stateless and zero cost future yeah

00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:22,929
you're sketching this I think now is

00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:25,899
really 9e but then it just does not

00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:28,179
they're sort of portion of icing and

00:49:25,899 --> 00:49:30,669
weight-loss IDs anything is a procedural

00:49:28,179 --> 00:49:33,099
macro you can see like the hash then

00:49:30,669 --> 00:49:35,139
there's a thing before the function but

00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:38,199
this is before that and then there's a

00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:43,899
weight a weight is also macro so

00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:45,699
procedural macro anyone is okay and push

00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:51,130
microbe and I can talk about what's the

00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:52,839
difference different macro ad yeah a way

00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:56,600
the protocol why they do this is they

00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:58,850
wonder what taps stroll taps rule then

00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:02,170
want to put everything together like how

00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:04,610
they did try the sign receptor tri tri

00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:08,450
micro there now there's sushi to the

00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:11,180
comma and a way similar last last time

00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:12,680
there was this away micro so they just

00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,360
want to like next time if they want to

00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,030
expand to anything they can thing later

00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:21,380
so the other MEP for them to use at the

00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:23,540
moment then emerged 2018 anything 0.2 is

00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:26,330
released in a it's broken so nobody

00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:28,370
right and then people ask when you do

00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:30,080
open tribute and then they say sometime

00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:32,960
later that thing I think I will be out

00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,490
like a few months later then but it's

00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,150
not a few months I you'll be very long

00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:41,570
now I think a way interesting await the

00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:44,900
do planning the NSA this is simple I

00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:48,490
think wait the first one so I think

00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:50,480
micron so now it's a comparable

00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:53,990
computing already so that's the thing

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:57,320
and saying you make this make this thing

00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:59,390
into like you be sugar it into another

00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,820
thing is a function and then return the

00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:04,010
future future if I always are in this

00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:06,440
case future I'll result I just wrap it

00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:09,890
in the future and then in fact you see

00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:12,370
she'll still await something a lot like

00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:18,560
this is that you're still seeing away

00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:21,290
and next is pin then the introduce

00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,840
pinning because there is a selfish to

00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:26,000
ensure right because the asynchronous

00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:28,790
stuff they reference to the structure

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,960
itself then just allow that then the

00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,580
introduced de streaming

00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,820
pinning for involve a tablet just make

00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:38,000
the type cannot move in mobile so this

00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:41,930
is too soft like the way the case where

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,280
acing they can basically they want to

00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:45,760
prevent them they want to tell the

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:50,980
compiler that they that you will move

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,980
yeah the judge of this cleaning pin API

00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:22,120
yeah but penis is like quite complicated

00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:24,550
then maybe if you want can even have a

00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:30,250
bookshop beat up to talk about pin

00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:31,630
length you usually don't you underneath

00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,730
it kept a pimp in it just for lab

00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:35,800
Realtors and we're obvious to the pin

00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:38,710
and then people can just take a look at

00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:42,460
the pin and next is the future crik crik

00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:45,220
crik next time I think a future quit

00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:47,200
goes to STD now so that my future career

00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:50,590
there's a district rate just Nero for

00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,330
one plus 0.1 0.2 and then later they

00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:54,550
just machine the base one like the past

00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:56,800
system and they're also machine a call

00:52:54,550 --> 00:53:00,070
future API just to allow the ecosystem

00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,730
to make everyone to use the use the rust

00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:05,680
and everyone and then they this future

00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:08,410
and then this weaker but we could even

00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:12,930
get true so and then restaurant Eid

00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:14,650
Edition came what was one of the focus

00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:18,520
but too bad

00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:22,480
I think mr. Edition so they just say are

00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:24,190
because they just do one play just keep

00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,630
they just we're gonna chase that line

00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:28,210
they just want to like do things slowly

00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:31,660
story okay just when the times can't

00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:35,910
they become then 2019 or people focus

00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:41,020
more on organ ohmic and people also ones

00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:44,530
the then they discard this although how

00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:46,630
to morgan ami in terms of their one

00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:49,450
don't they don't wander away to be a

00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:52,020
macro and say why are we still macro

00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:55,780
that they never want to discuss the

00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:58,300
solution to I remove the away macro so

00:53:55,780 --> 00:54:01,780
there's this other fallout solution

00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,440
although a brochure is like they don't

00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,910
have a cure

00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,740
it just depends on the order of the

00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:10,240
operation but this is confusing and it's

00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:13,180
okay little table then seem that

00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:17,350
synthetic sugar you know surfer standard

00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:20,050
prefix for this like professors are

00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:21,780
awake space something like in other

00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:26,380
languages

00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:30,550
and most of that pattern also then

00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:32,500
postfix it's like something away I don't

00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:36,070
think I don't wish I have this then a

00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:38,770
postfix to you this is like the instead

00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:42,580
of postfix dot the way the postfix is a

00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:45,790
way no a weight something from there but

00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:47,380
yeah to is weird although our choice we

00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:49,770
are quite confusing and for the city I

00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:52,540
don't know why but people are like a way

00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:54,250
people still is people still more

00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,260
formally way so they left it to solution

00:54:54,250 --> 00:55:02,980
either a way something or something away

00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:05,320
so prefix vs postfix and postfix 1y post

00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:08,200
very small follow me and it's more

00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:11,350
readable for us case so they decide

00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,880
don't care about other yes just the

00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:16,360
reason why they want to preface it just

00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,850
solely because they're one to be easy to

00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,700
adapt for other people but then this one

00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:24,250
but if you're ready after this people

00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:27,660
say assuming it means you forget about

00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:31,150
this witness but then you get used to it

00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:35,770
then they just aligns well with the

00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:40,150
comma operator for era handling so you

00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:44,110
can just arrow away away error then yeah

00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:46,090
so future idea then if you are

00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:50,410
interested you can just wait this

00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:53,800
Dropbox people on their arguments is

00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:56,950
quite long and generators then there

00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:59,290
goes generators coming now you know now

00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:01,330
they are discussing for way last last

00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:03,610
year they are the same for wait I think

00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:05,440
destructors but this one haven't came up

00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:08,490
here and it's we are discussing run time

00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:11,290
so if you ask run time is something I

00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:13,270
some something like something a green

00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:15,910
crest they just put on the system so

00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:17,380
they can use the run time and use the

00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:20,680
resting away because I think I will

00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:22,390
request a run time in this case you need

00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,330
to block what you need you don't just

00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:32,890
have the fuel crest so in a jam between

00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:35,589
jump between that the side

00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:38,859
that's why there's community speak like

00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:41,140
there's so many runtimes then now and

00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:44,049
then they they introduce effing STD it's

00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:47,410
not I don't taste anything but is by the

00:56:44,049 --> 00:56:49,869
library team probably somewhere on the

00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:51,309
testing site so they just it's a group

00:56:49,869 --> 00:56:54,730
people they just pull together I think

00:56:51,309 --> 00:56:57,369
as 2d essentially it's just essentially

00:56:54,730 --> 00:57:00,039
just a fastener stubborn standard

00:56:57,369 --> 00:57:02,890
library but in anything so anything that

00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:05,410
can wait you want like the gaping

00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:07,359
metadata from foul and they say only so

00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:08,739
far you can get them at the data there's

00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,690
your blocking come there so they put

00:57:08,739 --> 00:57:22,480
everything as wait I feel like this I

00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:25,900
splitting the yeah I think we should

00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,690
really just idea and then there's this

00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,239
why what did put more people on to do

00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:33,910
now came near us

00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:37,890
yeah not just clients but service then

00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:41,859
the thing is this client all about and

00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:44,049
and no the service I will not just if

00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:46,210
you about so if you want to spawn one

00:57:44,049 --> 00:57:50,829
trend for each each connection and then

00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:53,980
you'll be so you waste CPU and CP well

00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:57,759
maybe the Soviet the use parallelism and

00:57:53,980 --> 00:58:00,339
I Obon use concurrency and these native

00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:04,599
tress most of the world I while I won't

00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:06,369
ask like desire say it was you you just

00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:10,390
keep Swami try there's no the social and

00:58:06,369 --> 00:58:13,630
then the or most way people use cream

00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:15,299
tress and others like what they say is

00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:22,989
going and

00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:25,029
Erlang yes this one is they just after

00:58:22,989 --> 00:58:26,769
one cream try and respond so many trust

00:58:25,029 --> 00:58:30,009
each other green shirt too soft thing

00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:32,499
and oh my rust cannot have that I don't

00:58:30,009 --> 00:58:38,579
know I forgot why they say that it's not

00:58:32,499 --> 00:58:38,579
suited towards Russ yes

00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:51,230
then there's miss well first there's no

00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:54,410
gesture you say even look so they just

00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:57,350
use even look so the package that you

00:58:54,410 --> 00:59:01,160
will know well then then okay just

00:58:57,350 --> 00:59:04,720
compare JavaScript now have callback

00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:08,690
hell Russ I don't think they have yet

00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:11,270
and then John Square promise

00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:13,910
rats have future and Josh care I think I

00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:16,700
wait just a Russell's worth asking away

00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:19,550
so just a comparison promise its run

00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:22,640
time I've run time and future zero cost

00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:25,730
in Ross then push probably push based on

00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,170
pool based push based means that you you

00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:30,560
do the when you already then you just

00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:32,420
push then another why scuba so you just

00:59:30,560 --> 01:00:45,110
pull for keep polling for and you and

00:59:32,420 --> 01:00:47,450
one is when you start the yes leave out

01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:50,000
discount this is just a steam machine so

01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:51,890
you be in the state machine is faster by

01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,440
Josh promise because the prestige to be

01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:56,910
used so there's more location and the

01:00:54,440 --> 01:01:00,090
best thing is I think I missed the best

01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:00,900
is future you can use them

01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,450
interchangeably

01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:06,270
you can you wouldn't think of rust

01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:09,090
future and tuck in to let them and use

01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:11,490
it as you see from a promise and promise

01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:13,710
you can use restaurant in rust which oh

01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:17,640
you can use JavaScript homies you can

01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:18,510
use them interchangeably on web so if

01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,000
you rest on wisdom

01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:23,580
if you write a future you can use that

01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,970
in transcript and if you write some

01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:28,650
promise yeah just to waste so you is not

01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:30,630
like you use future than you promise

01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:38,790
then you yeah so they'll make it

01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:56,990
compatible so you can you think there's

01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:58,910
a future without you know sure I think

01:01:56,990 --> 01:02:05,940
[Music]

01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:09,030
yeah then Russia no garbage collector

01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,350
just that you know so because this is a

01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:13,020
way they design this way and because

01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:16,800
Russia no a collector rust future okay

01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:21,270
yeah works both ways if Adams yes so

01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:24,330
some code this is JavaScript with first

01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:28,980
one is called a hell I mean come back

01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:36,840
there is a kawaii promise you see that I

01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:39,600
can see then then the second one is

01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:45,990
promise and the third one is using a

01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:50,580
thing out way and this is Russ and this

01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:52,920
is Russ Russ also called Kovac but it's

01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:56,610
not already a Kovac it's just always

01:02:52,920 --> 01:03:00,890
wrong you don't forget oh okay mine my

01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:00,890
the rest was shouldn't be back yet I

01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:33,180
wrote a Kavita George your answer is

01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:35,670
wrong so the response should be is

01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:42,180
correct oh I saw that screen I'm sorry

01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:48,930
sorry I was looking at that I was okay

01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:51,990
in the screen oh yeah it's correct here

01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:54,900
but I was looking in the screen because

01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:58,410
JavaScript they're so rough you have a

01:03:54,900 --> 01:04:00,780
response you have a bracket and then

01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:09,750
hand there at once there's a rest of the

01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:13,170
coke no ice cold yeah and then and then

01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:16,200
Russell Sipe future the old future is

01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:18,330
and then and then you've got so many a

01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:20,310
net-net you can confuse data but you

01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:27,360
need to poll if Russ future if you don't

01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:29,460
poll then it will be call yeah you yeah

01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:31,860
rusty sure you need to be pull so if you

01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,750
don't consume the future for so just

01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,730
keep holding for to know future if you

01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:39,810
don't keep consuming then the picture

01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:43,230
one run then next Russell where I think

01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:45,000
a way I think and doctor wait so at the

01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:47,070
end except till we got away right so you

01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:56,070
can see request returns a future and you

01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:57,930
just don't wait that so no no they want

01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:59,190
to put away bracket is because they'd

01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:02,430
won and Confused away it's not a

01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:06,960
function it's a mineral Kshama except is

01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:09,570
dollar weight and then now how rough we

01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,510
areas works together you can see

01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:15,330
Fukushima away bracket comma this is

01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:17,070
trifle trifle is basically just if

01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:20,700
there's any area just propagate the

01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:21,670
error to the previous function trifle

01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,099
and a

01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:25,960
the result and try to retry the Oh

01:05:24,099 --> 01:05:28,569
babies out as well I didn't put that you

01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:30,490
need a try both and cry fool the other

01:05:28,569 --> 01:05:39,010
one the second one is just trifle but

01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:42,220
I'll wait you just wait every doll no if

01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:44,859
you're there question man then no just

01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:47,170
to show that how you are propagating

01:05:44,859 --> 01:05:54,720
error if there's no comma four after

01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:56,559
away means that this wrongs or is wrong

01:05:54,720 --> 01:06:07,660
yeah oh wait oh wait

01:05:56,559 --> 01:07:08,890
su-mei I reckon this are on the bucket

01:06:07,660 --> 01:07:12,730
is actually yeah yeah and not so so you

01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:14,380
can see that there's a rule after the

01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:19,270
wait forever before that way you can see

01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:21,420
clearly velocity from left to right yeah

01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:30,819
yeah at the brand that is two is not

01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:33,069
that rough already wrongly then okay yes

01:07:30,819 --> 01:07:34,750
just the parent edition before is not a

01:07:33,069 --> 01:07:38,380
way then

01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:41,040
then yes now so you can see this or this

01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:43,660
quite small anyway you can see like

01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:46,720
based on what night what the other

01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:48,580
groups show know inside militia some

01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,890
other people so writing Russ there show

01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:52,960
this so what we racing they use a Singh

01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:55,060
STD and a singer wait and then they

01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:59,560
removed this bunch of code we've just a

01:07:55,060 --> 01:08:00,640
few few lines if you can see if you

01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,109
cannot see you never mind

01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:14,530
you just know that you remove more than

01:08:02,109 --> 01:08:16,540
you okay yeah they just change from the

01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:18,130
usual one to ask away

01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:21,880
the nice thing about saying away is that

01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:25,049
it looks like you can use that you you

01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:28,989
it looks like a usual Conqueror the

01:08:25,049 --> 01:08:31,540
synchronous code that is parallel in

01:08:28,989 --> 01:08:31,900
parallel so they just remove a bunch of

01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,089
Stoppa

01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,950
you it just becomes simpler and easier

01:08:34,089 --> 01:08:39,910
to understand you don't let begin and

01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:42,850
then and then so before I forgot to say

01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:46,890
okay just a bit of future this some

01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:50,500
basic the future which is a trade and

01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:55,060
future just means that I'm thinking you

01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:58,770
with the irritant after some time then

01:08:55,060 --> 01:09:01,239
you get a output so is the Associated

01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:05,549
associate rate where you get a type

01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:07,960
output and you also get a poll so

01:09:05,549 --> 01:09:11,170
usually people you just keep looping to

01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:14,200
poll for the value and you return output

01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:18,400
at the end and you should take pinna use

01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:23,469
pin here so how so and then the state

01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:26,020
machine so the generator every every

01:09:23,469 --> 01:09:28,480
dollar wait it's supposed to be like

01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:32,290
these are full don't wait for purgatory

01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:35,739
I just know the example like now

01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:39,630
generalize that were then see for every

01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:44,080
dollar we tried this decree like a

01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:46,390
suspension point a checkpoint like where

01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,339
it's are spent waiting myself span like

01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:54,100
for every the way

01:09:48,339 --> 01:10:26,470
so the solar this can he can run a book

01:09:54,100 --> 01:11:29,770
can be running at the same time so them

01:10:26,470 --> 01:11:31,600
together so okay so this one is how you

01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:34,570
generate so first you can see the

01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:36,760
structure contains input the Jerry

01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:38,890
something Eddie's then the contains

01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:45,310
input and they just create a future for

01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:47,950
you and then this one is just to explain

01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:50,220
I have in general for you so at the

01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:53,710
state for each state they will step into

01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:55,480
structure then for the structure they

01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:59,650
will transition into another state and

01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:01,969
in structure so they save the state yeah

01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:15,670
then they also save the future

01:12:01,969 --> 01:12:19,670
inside the structure then there also

01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:21,739
they also do like based on date what

01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:23,540
should the function do next so it's a

01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:25,820
state machine essentially so they just

01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:28,640
said after this state do this state as

01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:40,030
the state with this state and there that

01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:42,530
they keep yeah and then then then for

01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:44,270
least a rough idea I didn't go too deep

01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:46,219
into this but this particular state

01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:48,140
machine so in turn it looks something

01:12:46,219 --> 01:12:51,460
like this so before and it starts on

01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:54,469
pole then foo and bar and next is a

01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:59,270
optimization that they do is zero cost

01:12:54,469 --> 01:13:01,190
and I think a way I think a thing F n so

01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:04,750
as n you like something I

01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:08,420
generator and state machine and and then

01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:10,460
one of the agenda to is the enough they

01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:15,290
are great they are using another I just

01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:17,570
now the enum for the state it will be

01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:19,670
packed with only the stuff that they

01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:23,030
need each time so they will generate

01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:26,719
like a call Court racers like which like

01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:30,050
that be AG directed acyclic graph so

01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:33,910
there are just see wish then you can

01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:38,960
know which one is needed which point so

01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:42,410
you come into some new ADIZ in am foo

01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:46,489
and poor suspending 0 suspend one and

01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:49,550
then so because if you notice right some

01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:51,739
something is not not necessary

01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:54,050
everything needs to be storing suspend 0

01:13:51,739 --> 01:13:56,000
that way not necessary everything needs

01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:57,560
to be stolen suspend one why if you have

01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,960
something that only uses has been one

01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:02,270
zero and one so they will turn this into

01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:04,730
something efficient so that they can

01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:10,460
reuse the same space for the future

01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:14,120
stuff the future yeah so they reused the

01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:15,800
in am right nekron a structure so let's

01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,989
say you can see that the

01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,969
they can create this you can see that

01:14:17,989 --> 01:14:22,519
it's called table to illustrate let's

01:14:19,969 --> 01:14:24,800
say if you have a function that needs

01:14:22,519 --> 01:14:27,260
some something so they're only for the

01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,889
state right the only con taste those

01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:32,749
kind of function to like keep the memory

01:14:29,889 --> 01:14:33,949
keep the memory low in Maya so they

01:14:32,749 --> 01:15:08,389
didn't they just throw away the table

01:14:33,949 --> 01:15:10,190
there's no neither some it's just to say

01:15:08,389 --> 01:15:12,440
that they're optimized for either size

01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:14,780
storing the future they need to store

01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:27,590
the future somewhere so the optimal size

01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:30,829
for storing no no this under this one

01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:34,699
just say roughly how they're so

01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:37,869
basically their structure so this is

01:15:34,699 --> 01:15:41,059
like a and then this IB so let's say if

01:15:37,869 --> 01:15:43,369
there are some stuff the site because if

01:15:41,059 --> 01:15:45,050
they if you have new future it keeps

01:15:43,369 --> 01:15:47,269
coming packing in right but let's say

01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:50,809
you have some stuff there's not news in

01:15:47,269 --> 01:15:53,179
some state this is just internally just

01:15:50,809 --> 01:15:56,170
internally you don't need to do this

01:15:53,179 --> 01:15:59,809
it just internally how they optimize the

01:15:56,170 --> 01:16:07,429
futures to only use it for zero cost and

01:15:59,809 --> 01:16:10,539
then minimize the memory usage yeah so

01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:10,539
they can say yeah

01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:35,890
yeah it's just you know I just to safe

01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:38,020
memory a memory just something are using

01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:41,130
it here with the same memory so an area

01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:45,400
facing a CD right just asking one of the

01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:56,410
standard way I feel like this yeah most

01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:58,270
of those similar to a tannery when I'm

01:16:56,410 --> 01:17:00,040
not sure but I think all function is a

01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:04,870
standard library will be interesting

01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:28,980
because best copy teapot is that I think

01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:31,960
it's so great maybe not maybe not maybe

01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:32,380
maybe nobody's I just I just mean let me

01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:38,290
see

01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:40,180
then then s or so they're these tasks if

01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:42,610
they run right now they doesn't have a

01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:44,110
thing on the main you can have a thing

01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:47,560
on function but you can accessing on

01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:51,610
main so what I do is just just so

01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:55,210
they'll just keep talking here that's

01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:57,610
why they're for runtime huh yes this is

01:17:55,210 --> 01:18:12,969
from SES to be this class I mean to

01:17:57,610 --> 01:18:16,090
close a similar so so instead of reading

01:18:12,969 --> 01:18:17,440
this right then that's why they have

01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:20,800
this kind of thing they call like

01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:23,560
runtime so this is to just decorate you

01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,930
just put on top of your I think event

01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:28,210
main main function then they you don't

01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:30,400
even need to do the daunting you can

01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:33,880
even write a thing after you put this

01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:36,910
right like Tokyo main then then you

01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:39,340
don't need to do like a thing no you do

01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:40,749
need to do a enemy you can just directly

01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:44,729
I think I mean

01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:44,729
then you can just do a thing that really

01:18:45,749 --> 01:18:53,050
stay the same yeah one of them this six

01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:55,539
each one have different purposes

01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:58,989
different functionalities

01:18:55,539 --> 01:19:01,659
but yeah it's a lot nicer than know

01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:05,320
which one is for each one but just just

01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:07,989
pick anyway I think I used a thing s TV

01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:12,460
but it seemed it just allow you used to

01:19:07,989 --> 01:19:13,780
it just allows you to do I think I think

01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:16,979
in me just like that

01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:20,409
you see I'm using a plot on yeah

01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:23,650
then what anything does I think this

01:19:20,409 --> 01:19:26,079
calls us this P in API there's there's

01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:29,949
this thing yes a stingray be assessing

01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:33,039
read and write we assessing crime messed

01:19:29,949 --> 01:19:35,889
up we request manola request Bopha

01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:37,090
request a both sing API and I think API

01:19:35,889 --> 01:19:38,679
in the latest one I think I were

01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:48,010
released one point zero yet they're

01:19:38,679 --> 01:19:50,429
going to do so about hell thing is

01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:53,409
docking I think it's not non-blocking

01:19:50,429 --> 01:19:56,349
yeah but stuff is good myself either

01:19:53,409 --> 01:19:58,300
create built by to to browse the web

01:19:56,349 --> 01:20:00,159
like request similar to request except

01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:03,280
they do something interesting using a

01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:05,949
way to get the data right now you need

01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:09,010
to follow request you need something a

01:20:05,949 --> 01:20:10,630
dot Jason not Jason and briquette to

01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:12,639
Kennedy that right but this one is quite

01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:16,090
interesting it's because you just build

01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:19,570
the future to call the API and then you

01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:21,550
just dot await then you call API so

01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:28,809
dollar is something that your call to

01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:30,340
get the data so so later request so edit

01:20:28,809 --> 01:20:35,920
I think that it's too different from

01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:50,909
surf but so if it's written by the acing

01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:50,909
async EEMA yeah

01:20:53,699 --> 01:20:58,300
right now I still I will still prefer

01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,639
the request with the blocking API

01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:02,619
because I try not everything's a

01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,239
processing year like even the certain

01:21:02,619 --> 01:21:05,440
the foot for serialization you should

01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:08,530
assume that really that's one of the

01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:11,590
people not like less apart yeah still

01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:13,690
new I think I think is too new and

01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:16,030
there's less support for like I think

01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:17,949
reacting right even cert you don't get

01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:20,019
anything with anything right so you

01:21:17,949 --> 01:21:23,199
cannot just call ready completely from

01:21:20,019 --> 01:21:24,999
acing in to serialize to serialize you

01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:27,030
cannot just to write the letter from

01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:32,139
riddle and to write the right function

01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:34,570
to insurrection so you have subjects on

01:21:32,139 --> 01:21:37,409
your from reader and to writer so from

01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:40,599
reader is you taking the reader in

01:21:37,409 --> 01:21:44,229
Madrid into a and then B she realized

01:21:40,599 --> 01:21:46,479
that into a structure and then directly

01:21:44,229 --> 01:21:48,639
if you're taking a structure and then be

01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:52,659
sure this you realize it into a read

01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:57,099
into the data that serious data so you

01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:58,840
Jason you just issued a spacer so that's

01:21:57,099 --> 01:21:59,739
quite interesting is I just serious

01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:02,590
really

01:21:59,739 --> 01:22:06,670
you just had derived serialize serialize

01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:08,979
then you can just create with that mark

01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:10,709
electric motor created so if you do

01:22:08,979 --> 01:22:14,199
Jason you can convert between multiple

01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:16,780
types also can that our library copy off

01:22:14,199 --> 01:22:21,489
you can contain different power salsa

01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:25,719
adjacent to Tamil Tamil to cbor cbor -

01:22:21,489 --> 01:22:27,400
yeah okay I think great then there's

01:22:25,719 --> 01:22:31,199
also currently there so so I think red

01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:34,119
Madness where people are discussing but

01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:37,389
there's no icing tray inside the tray

01:22:34,119 --> 01:22:39,519
you cannot put a Singh FN if you have a

01:22:37,389 --> 01:22:41,170
trade rest of trade right to like to

01:22:39,519 --> 01:22:45,610
specify that what kind of behaviors that

01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:48,489
thing do so the current method is just

01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:51,130
to use pinpin Pula twist they allow you

01:22:48,489 --> 01:22:51,579
to use a thing FN in trade but you can

01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:57,670
do that

01:22:51,579 --> 01:23:00,010
I think FN in trade in trade in your

01:22:57,670 --> 01:23:06,059
decade as the essing event in Freight

01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:06,059
you can do they know your spin project

01:23:23,710 --> 01:24:04,700
yeah something oh no no yeah I think oh

01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:08,320
sure like sometimes you see like move

01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:10,720
param but how they don't know how do we

01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:15,440
are still discussing on this as well

01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:18,260
move param but I think move I think

01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:40,070
Roger can but if I think I think moving

01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:42,740
some issues I think because I saw this

01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:47,110
somewhere in ethics ethics or some

01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:47,110
babies oh this one but

01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:41,719
not yet and was a call thanks Akane

01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:45,730
comic mess akiza we call Misaki is he's

01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:45,730
also doing anything in the way

01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,740
you

01:26:01,099 --> 01:26:09,610
until until he no do you know he stops

01:26:05,599 --> 01:26:09,610
learning something so

01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:15,890
you

01:26:24,129 --> 01:26:30,269
he's not out yet he just disgusting yeah

01:26:30,429 --> 01:26:36,099
based on what away from his huh so the

01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:38,800
more readings you can read the a thing

01:26:36,099 --> 01:26:40,479
book there's but I think I think looking

01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:43,209
group there's this essing book and

01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:47,139
there's no streamcon currencies talking

01:26:43,209 --> 01:26:49,709
about how a thing works I in concurrency

01:26:47,139 --> 01:26:52,179
way like iterator Excel we seen streams

01:26:49,709 --> 01:26:53,499
stream stream she's so so not oh yeah

01:26:52,179 --> 01:26:56,320
this is a one of the thing they want to

01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:58,479
think about they want to put stream into

01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:01,209
a scenario or what but there's this

01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:03,669
trait they want to do this as something

01:27:01,209 --> 01:27:05,829
similar to a thing rate anything right

01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:08,829
but these streams is that iterator

01:27:05,829 --> 01:27:11,349
actually assessing notice it'll return

01:27:08,829 --> 01:27:13,869
rats right but there's no acting version

01:27:11,349 --> 01:27:19,030
of iterator so streams is something like

01:27:13,869 --> 01:27:20,709
a sing iterator so they want to discuss

01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:22,780
I this room score Commerce East they

01:27:20,709 --> 01:27:25,300
want to discuss how they do it with like

01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:27,849
the racing stuff they want to how they

01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:31,059
want to split the iterator you can you

01:27:27,849 --> 01:27:32,679
can split right you can speed it or us

01:27:31,059 --> 01:27:37,269
literally you can do a lot of editorial

01:27:32,679 --> 01:27:47,109
get split join something in it except

01:27:37,269 --> 01:27:50,679
they want to do it for like there but

01:27:47,109 --> 01:27:55,800
different is familiar it'll be racing a

01:27:50,679 --> 01:27:55,800
bit like maybe I be honest but the list

01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:07,780
something in it but it's pretty baller

01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:10,390
because it just talked about the stream

01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:14,160
and how how different different streams

01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:14,160
is implemented in different ways

01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:27,760
yeah they show like what to many many to

01:28:18,489 --> 01:28:32,380
one month 111 is many disgusting then

01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:32,590
there's also rust journeys to I thing

01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,610
away

01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:42,489
I think mister that's one already

01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:46,390
frustrate I think a way thing not just

01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:47,980
because should prepare then rust you

01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:50,949
need to I think a way just discussing on

01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:54,489
like history or so but it's like more in

01:28:50,949 --> 01:28:56,489
depth about the other one the other and

01:28:54,489 --> 01:28:59,050
the Google guy also title memory

01:28:56,489 --> 01:29:02,260
although they talked about the life of a

01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:04,330
thing offender night that how the

01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:07,030
optimization he just he explained it

01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:09,190
quite clear but he just that whole time

01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:13,540
just talking about how they see how the

01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:21,969
async FN comes in oh yeah how did you

01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:24,760
really ask a fan okay make sure how much

01:29:21,969 --> 01:29:26,260
more than maybe there one question can

01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:35,530
get one for yeah five minutes

01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:39,250
you went Iman and I YouTube your anyway

01:29:35,530 --> 01:29:41,520
I need to ask questions you all have

01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:41,520
questions

01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:59,050
I think it's do something any I'm not

01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:03,040
conscious but I think because they're

01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:07,480
saying I think there are times do

01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:12,420
something I don't know

01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:14,860
maybe yeah the runtime is something like

01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:17,380
make the code at run time I like to now

01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:19,120
show that a quiet runtime this tactics

01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:23,890
out here I did I see this was the right

01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:26,370
time but I call fun time but I don't

01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:26,370
hide the key

01:31:05,630 --> 01:31:08,949
[Music]

01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:34,900
de Morgan

01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:43,150
they'll say demo

01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:51,750
okay

01:31:54,130 --> 01:31:57,399
[Music]

01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:37,000
I am you can stop okay

01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:46,940
and actually very new to Ruslan like two

01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:52,370
months ago

01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:54,710
since two months ago when I start to

01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:56,890
look at rush I find it really

01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:56,890
interesting

01:32:57,250 --> 01:33:08,120
it made me give up reactor as react

01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:11,720
native everything so I start to look at

01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:18,830
doom first and then we don't to compare

01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:24,530
all the days to R Us or WSM I figure

01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:29,210
this thing as you can see the s doom is

01:33:24,530 --> 01:33:31,910
having swept jQuery Brad Mira prototype

01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:35,630
and then we dome is the one we are

01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:40,040
familiar with read and you love you and

01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:42,920
then from Rush we are having rust

01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:50,020
dominated but I am going to

01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:53,510
share today and then STD via WSM baingan

01:33:50,020 --> 01:34:00,290
and then from victim site for us is

01:33:53,510 --> 01:34:05,570
dodrio and new ok this is the benchmark

01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:08,530
I figure from the website you can go to

01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:08,530
this website

01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:29,880
from here you can choose the framework

01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:32,930
you choose numbers then they say you

01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:46,140
want to look at view

01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:51,270
stiva vanilla WSM then various thus this

01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:57,290
is the result and this is the one I cut

01:34:51,270 --> 01:35:02,280
and paste if you look at the bigger one

01:34:57,290 --> 01:35:09,090
from here you can see the react Redux or

01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:14,490
yet hope is actually slowest especially

01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:20,750
at the shot loss if you look at create

01:35:14,490 --> 01:35:25,530
rose almost every one is similar and

01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:31,200
then select rule react adducts this

01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:35,190
slower is double slow and then stop Rose

01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:38,550
is ridiculously slow for rare is

01:35:35,190 --> 01:35:44,670
actually the same for angular or view

01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:48,990
actually why this happen later are you

01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:52,680
discuss apitla and then if you want to

01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:54,810
look at the codes that do the

01:35:52,680 --> 01:36:03,720
benchmarking you can come to this

01:35:54,810 --> 01:36:09,500
website this is where the create the

01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:16,200
samples and then the frameworks for each

01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:20,690
of the framework so over here this one

01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,690
is redux redux

01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:25,640
even the Dominator is over here

01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:41,680
and then the winner of all of the

01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:48,060
framework is actually a BSM Benjen

01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:48,060
why this is the fastest because it is

01:36:51,150 --> 01:37:01,150
directly talk to the browser API which

01:36:54,550 --> 01:37:03,940
is the depth idea and then we look at

01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:10,380
the pro and con of doom

01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:16,240
we asked Freedom Fest from the dom site

01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:20,590
any normal person looking at the picture

01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:24,580
of ABC and new ABC and then the small

01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:27,670
yellow - big yellow you will be thinking

01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:32,130
we should be updating this - component

01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:37,090
only right new ABC and big yellow

01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:39,430
component but some of the funny guy for

01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:44,580
me the rapper they might be thinking

01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:48,430
since the pêche require love updates

01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:53,800
they will just trigger the whole page of

01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:57,580
updates on the blue page so this is the

01:37:53,800 --> 01:38:02,830
problem of doom when you are having a

01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:07,090
developer but good developer you update

01:38:02,830 --> 01:38:12,430
each component or each element

01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:17,530
accordingly and then when we are having

01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:24,340
a lot better lovers that's why the idea

01:38:17,530 --> 01:38:28,720
of beat'em come up the item you actually

01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:32,140
do the job of good developer they do the

01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:39,610
this so identify what's the difference

01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:43,159
of the page from the previous page to

01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:50,929
the current new patch if the

01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:53,929
updated elements the good thing is the

01:38:50,929 --> 01:38:59,030
victim to all the job you don't have to

01:38:53,929 --> 01:39:03,590
be worried about how to handle the

01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:06,500
states the bad thing is when it is

01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:10,370
having a thousand components or having a

01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:11,540
thousand rows within a rows having a ten

01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:14,510
decels

01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:18,440
20 columns something like that that

01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:24,100
would accumulate up to a few thousands

01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:28,820
of components and it actually doubled

01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:32,210
what is having on your pitch if you're

01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:36,469
having 1,000 it actually is or 2,000 of

01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:42,440
components to do the disk that's right

01:39:36,469 --> 01:39:50,960
when we are doing the swap rows over

01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:55,429
here swap rows for normal to frame but

01:39:50,960 --> 01:40:02,000
it is very fast but it is super slow 10

01:39:55,429 --> 01:40:05,989
times slower than doom and ring this is

01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:11,420
the problem of vidalin okay and then

01:40:05,989 --> 01:40:18,530
here comes W ASM and Jess just now we

01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:23,000
see the a lot the S frame in V Thomas

01:40:18,530 --> 01:40:30,350
all right over here actually this one

01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:33,080
cell is the fastest test frame but it is

01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:37,400
the number one is also one of the

01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:43,790
smallest primer also the fastest but

01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:45,820
when it is comparing to WSM over here it

01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:50,719
actually loosen up

01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:54,999
as you can see over here all all the

01:40:50,719 --> 01:41:03,550
number one is over the search

01:40:54,999 --> 01:41:10,599
is a bit slow 10% or 15% 16% 14% slower

01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:17,309
that this one is 32% slower okay let's

01:41:10,599 --> 01:41:21,519
look at this one the good thing of

01:41:17,309 --> 01:41:25,630
gestures superman' generating more than

01:41:21,519 --> 01:41:29,530
20 years and then super optimized

01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:35,519
flexible biggest community because women

01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:38,650
and then on WSM say this is the fastest

01:41:35,519 --> 01:41:42,360
binary support white binary support

01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:47,019
because JSI is actually everything is

01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:48,969
string you look at the constant yes is

01:41:47,019 --> 01:41:52,059
actually everything's a string when

01:41:48,969 --> 01:41:57,820
you're transferring data or image file

01:41:52,059 --> 01:42:00,130
is actually serialize it and then commit

01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:03,909
it to the string then from the string

01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:09,849
respect to the browser API convert back

01:42:03,909 --> 01:42:16,479
to binary so it is very slow on binary

01:42:09,849 --> 01:42:24,039
transfer and then WSM also allowed us to

01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:27,729
have true multi-threading and then this

01:42:24,039 --> 01:42:34,719
is the thing you you know laughter and

01:42:27,729 --> 01:42:39,699
then the on the con side yes is a single

01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:43,570
track on html5 it is having the voter

01:42:39,699 --> 01:42:48,789
trait but still not not eat retina is a

01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:51,639
more of multi-process after it handled

01:42:48,789 --> 01:42:56,320
the process come back and update the

01:42:51,639 --> 01:43:01,570
value it cannot concurrently or a

01:42:56,320 --> 01:43:06,099
synchronously update the same value from

01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:07,719
different thread and then also harder to

01:43:06,099 --> 01:43:18,660
debug

01:43:07,719 --> 01:43:18,660
for WSM site I think it is still really

01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:28,870
listed for Mila I think if you have a

01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:31,480
hobby or you are challenging yourself to

01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:39,510
do the things I think is this very good

01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:45,430
stuff because you will know a lot of

01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:49,120
code base and I mean the the the the the

01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:51,870
core of the framework everything how it

01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:55,040
is feel if you start now

01:43:51,870 --> 01:43:55,040
[Music]

01:43:57,989 --> 01:44:09,070
why Russ Dominator singer sing ping

01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:12,190
mouth retreating like just now you saw

01:44:09,070 --> 01:44:18,820
the future right Russ Dominator is

01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:25,030
having enhance future it has a future

01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:29,560
signal library that is actually a

01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:38,650
polling polling machine to facilitate

01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:40,719
the steps so in the conventional domo

01:44:38,650 --> 01:44:48,940
Batum library we are having state

01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:56,130
management hope simple set of the task

01:44:48,940 --> 01:45:00,130
of Mondex anything else but how about

01:44:56,130 --> 01:45:03,840
this new thing signal same thing in

01:45:00,130 --> 01:45:12,330
signal later I will show you what is it

01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:17,010
and then components a lot of times we

01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:19,270
don't actually need to write a component

01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:23,490
like in Rio

01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:29,680
they have a real component to simplify

01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:35,290
the component that is not having step or

01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:38,260
process within the component then in

01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:41,590
Russia we are actually able to utilize

01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:51,130
macros instead of writing a lot of

01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:55,330
components here this is the butt ice

01:45:51,130 --> 01:46:01,350
view of rust Dominator the big picture

01:45:55,330 --> 01:46:01,350
or architecture will of rust Dominator

01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:18,910
everything you write is using macro

01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:28,360
instead of you can visit the other

01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:36,550
source code over here this is the hello

01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:41,770
Bo of the boilerplate III mitten a

01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:44,550
boilerplate for this hello you can look

01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:44,550
at it from here

01:46:51,689 --> 01:47:01,769
so here and then you can follow the

01:46:57,539 --> 01:47:06,209
instruction on how this boilerplate is

01:47:01,769 --> 01:47:10,760
create the lung from stab you create a

01:47:06,209 --> 01:47:20,760
folder and then you to the cargo in it

01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:30,320
then copy the things inside here you can

01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:30,320
follow all the DOS inside over here and

01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:46,079
show you the okay this is the stigma

01:47:42,169 --> 01:47:51,050
inside dominate the five point five zero

01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:54,479
point five point five WS and bingen

01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:57,840
future signal future signal last set

01:47:54,479 --> 01:48:06,229
just not this actually derive from

01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:06,229
future and it is actually polling engine

01:48:13,610 --> 01:48:45,269
you can see this one this one can see I

01:48:18,530 --> 01:48:49,709
can see the big one is over here if you

01:48:45,269 --> 01:48:56,599
want to go people I have another sample

01:48:49,709 --> 01:48:56,599
written this is the Dominator component

01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:05,680
yes over here

01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:11,880
you can just do young in stone and then

01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:20,560
bill started the saw Scott is here

01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:22,990
inside is having a one one one of that

01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:30,220
farm that is having three of the

01:49:22,990 --> 01:50:00,190
parent-child and even this better let me

01:49:30,220 --> 01:50:06,640
see if I can zoom in this one can see

01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:12,220
I'm okay this is this is the snapping

01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:20,470
point on that's nothing point they will

01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:29,260
call the app episode 1 here and then as

01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:38,950
you can see everything is Futurity allow

01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:40,960
you to deal with multi three things all

01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:46,720
these atomically you reference

01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:49,570
continents unlisted respond to that some

01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:53,110
policy are here some saucy right and

01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:56,830
this one I just purposely put it like

01:50:53,110 --> 01:51:01,480
that so that you can see actually you

01:50:56,830 --> 01:51:08,320
can mix with it if you if you change it

01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:10,690
to I see any works for example this one

01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:13,020
if you change to I see it is actually a

01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:13,020
box

01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:22,370
but so you're changing it back to a RCEP

01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:25,490
does all that I beg your pardon

01:51:22,370 --> 01:51:27,320
so so you just put I see by default and

01:51:25,490 --> 01:51:30,830
just put it back to era see if it

01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:48,190
doesn't work but good as he is for Silla

01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:51,380
should be as he doesn't faster but I

01:51:48,190 --> 01:51:57,730
just put it over here to show that you

01:51:51,380 --> 01:52:05,360
can actually use puff of it so when you

01:51:57,730 --> 01:52:14,410
go into it if you actually lender the

01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:19,220
parent the parent is over here just

01:52:14,410 --> 01:52:22,520
something like I see the HTML tag it

01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:27,200
looks like HTML tag but it is not as the

01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:30,350
effect you see it is a macro this is a

01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:32,210
macro is a quick format cool on your

01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:36,640
cereal you can just put the original or

01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:41,870
HTML tag then you can no you cannot use

01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:55,480
original HTML but this there's a

01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:57,580
Grateful Dead right you you you promote

01:52:55,480 --> 01:53:05,060
the rescue

01:52:57,580 --> 01:53:12,280
why do you when you w this one this one

01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:16,460
this one so there's no me neither

01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:18,830
yeah because there's a good thing to use

01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:24,860
macros later I will show you what it is

01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:30,560
good then this sample you

01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:37,460
actually come to you have a shower ender

01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:43,699
as a children of this div and then from

01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:47,840
the Chow if you handle the tree and then

01:53:43,699 --> 01:53:51,889
we turn the trick from here he will

01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:54,320
return the trick and this trick is

01:53:51,889 --> 01:54:01,790
handled by the event dispatcher I've

01:53:54,320 --> 01:54:03,920
written it is actually listener as you

01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:07,520
can see this one is using a aussi you

01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:15,560
can actually change to a see also a new

01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:17,590
one after is received a signal that the

01:54:15,560 --> 01:54:21,610
listener received a signal give you

01:54:17,590 --> 01:54:25,130
perspective over here and then the palin

01:54:21,610 --> 01:54:34,780
this is the Perenara T this is the

01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:39,110
Perenara d7 the parallel handle you

01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:44,409
update the value of disinfected right

01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:44,409
Victor let me try run

01:54:53,609 --> 01:55:11,070
if you have computer you can run from

01:54:56,969 --> 01:55:13,499
the github and then you can try long as

01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:17,369
you can say it is updating the parent

01:55:13,499 --> 01:55:21,379
this one is on the parent on the green

01:55:17,369 --> 01:55:28,609
pretty side the the row is the charm

01:55:21,379 --> 01:55:28,609
then I like trade right great

01:55:29,629 --> 01:55:47,070
this is the sample also your things you

01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:50,669
know I you can you can you can write

01:55:47,070 --> 01:55:53,329
your own event dispatcher and then how

01:55:50,669 --> 01:56:04,949
you want to handle it is up to you learn

01:55:53,329 --> 01:56:18,409
how about you need this one this listen

01:56:04,949 --> 01:56:23,249
if this one you can see on this one I

01:56:18,409 --> 01:56:27,030
make it shot from yeah it's actually the

01:56:23,249 --> 01:56:34,010
same inside the brass Dominator

01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:39,570
component sample if you look at signum

01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:45,859
this is built in from the Dominator

01:56:39,570 --> 01:56:56,010
frame this one is handle ready it will

01:56:45,859 --> 01:56:59,809
look for the cricket mutex malleable the

01:56:56,010 --> 01:57:04,019
victim is a mutex available if you look

01:56:59,809 --> 01:57:06,579
at the parents track them we declare the

01:57:04,019 --> 01:57:18,150
mutable

01:57:06,579 --> 01:57:18,150
I studied do is a integer value is a

01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:26,710
mutex well when I do it's level neither

01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:33,250
is available that is accessible from

01:57:26,710 --> 01:57:38,079
from the straight line you cannot simply

01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:42,540
the 32 wherever and expect it to be

01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:46,960
usable from the signal you cannot

01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:50,980
because it is not try stuff you need to

01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:59,219
use this multiple is actually the same

01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:59,219
as new tax from the sing the same thing

01:58:02,309 --> 01:58:13,469
this is not really a trick

01:58:05,079 --> 01:58:16,809
this is future future it enhance me if

01:58:13,469 --> 01:58:22,510
signal this signal is actually a polling

01:58:16,809 --> 01:58:26,070
engine is actually a future you can look

01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:41,590
at the code of future underscore signal

01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:46,170
this is this one future underscore

01:58:41,590 --> 01:58:46,170
signal you can actually look at the

01:58:48,480 --> 01:59:05,670
future signal it's not in doctores top

01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:05,670
dollar has insurance yeah

01:59:17,859 --> 01:59:25,339
so have you have you thought of

01:59:22,579 --> 01:59:28,189
replacing the HTML a macro is a

01:59:25,339 --> 01:59:35,769
procedural macro something like the

01:59:28,189 --> 01:59:38,839
codes who creates I'm I beg your pardon

01:59:35,769 --> 01:59:44,389
have you thought about replacing the

01:59:38,839 --> 01:59:50,780
HTML macro this policy yeah you can do a

01:59:44,389 --> 01:59:56,929
custom macro something like this for

01:59:50,780 --> 02:00:00,889
example the video Tecna is very

01:59:56,929 --> 02:00:02,119
complicated you need to do the wish hi

02:00:00,889 --> 02:00:07,659
there sauce

02:00:02,119 --> 02:00:07,659
but how if you have your own video macro

02:00:07,959 --> 02:00:16,789
yes you can say I pass in only the video

02:00:12,439 --> 02:00:19,579
sauce and then the attribute is the is

02:00:16,789 --> 02:00:25,269
the children and the rest of the course

02:00:19,579 --> 02:00:25,269
I can pass in multiple attribute like

02:00:26,679 --> 02:00:36,969
new autoplay for for the GP

02:00:32,929 --> 02:00:39,439
there's are multiple it we built for it

02:00:36,969 --> 02:00:42,319
as soon as it you can write your own

02:00:39,439 --> 02:00:47,869
macro like this you can pass in the

02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:50,780
sauce over here I mean this is really

02:00:47,869 --> 02:00:55,999
good video a custom battles what they

02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:58,729
mean is the procedural macros like the

02:00:55,999 --> 02:01:01,639
ones that you get the token tree and you

02:00:58,729 --> 02:01:07,629
use you parse the token tree yourself so

02:01:01,639 --> 02:01:11,300
you can have DSL right stimulus yes

02:01:07,629 --> 02:01:16,179
you're a civilized thing yeah if you

02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:21,409
google group macro he ROC macro workshop

02:01:16,179 --> 02:01:23,170
absence of examples of how they do it is

02:01:21,409 --> 02:01:27,610
before the function right you put it

02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:30,730
for the function if yeah so maybe broke

02:01:27,610 --> 02:01:35,739
macro workshop this is like yeah this is

02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:38,800
a bit urgent so these are still normal

02:01:35,739 --> 02:01:43,510
backwards TV police profile gets the

02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:51,000
token tree so maybe Google for broke

02:01:43,510 --> 02:01:55,120
macro workshop this allows you to have

02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:58,000
that your own language big item yeah I

02:01:55,120 --> 02:02:03,900
think I think it is possible as long as

02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,900
you know how to write the macro right

02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:16,929
something else that I was using the is

02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:21,810
and it's low especially in chrome is the

02:02:16,929 --> 02:02:26,130
breach when you call the function

02:02:21,810 --> 02:02:29,770
actually this low I a benchmark like

02:02:26,130 --> 02:02:33,219
10,000 calls two to three milliseconds

02:02:29,770 --> 02:02:37,179
but in Firefox it was less than a

02:02:33,219 --> 02:02:39,190
millisecond so eating is really as

02:02:37,179 --> 02:02:44,790
though the police bit bridge between

02:02:39,190 --> 02:02:52,300
JavaScript to us have you have you

02:02:44,790 --> 02:03:13,600
noticed any issues as long as you are

02:02:52,300 --> 02:03:20,320
writing everything in is as long as you

02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:25,090
don't deal with the JavaScript you you

02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:32,550
you won't be having a problem I do see a

02:03:25,090 --> 02:03:35,380
lot of discussion on the disco they do

02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:36,729
acknowledge that if you are dealing with

02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:39,369
JavaScript

02:03:36,729 --> 02:03:44,139
from WSM and then back and forth like

02:03:39,369 --> 02:03:49,630
that right you will be facing a lot of

02:03:44,139 --> 02:03:57,539
problem especially in the slogan but if

02:03:49,630 --> 02:04:02,289
you are using this thing the web sees

02:03:57,539 --> 02:04:06,510
this one the web sees actually they

02:04:02,289 --> 02:04:12,579
likely talk to main idea of the browser

02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:15,909
the the api of the browser so everything

02:04:12,579 --> 02:04:18,130
is actually done it actually yeah I

02:04:15,909 --> 02:04:21,940
don't know maybe this is recess right

02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:25,590
because last time I checked the the web

02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:28,809
ID and proposal that they change it be

02:04:25,590 --> 02:04:32,079
something interpreted okay so long story

02:04:28,809 --> 02:04:34,360
short the FIPS is great generates a

02:04:32,079 --> 02:04:36,159
bunch of JavaScript loop in the

02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:39,610
background so if you now open your

02:04:36,159 --> 02:04:43,030
Firefox right the JavaScript in notes

02:04:39,610 --> 02:04:45,340
for each single right click and left

02:04:43,030 --> 02:04:48,699
click in your demo there should be a

02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:53,999
quote that powers the JavaScript event

02:04:48,699 --> 02:04:56,949
to Rison so that part's actually

02:04:53,999 --> 02:05:02,199
currently has dispatch that is quite

02:04:56,949 --> 02:05:05,590
heavy so the developer ideal doesn't

02:05:02,199 --> 02:05:07,959
come debit flipsies doesn't technically

02:05:05,590 --> 02:05:13,469
called talk to the idea yet

02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:21,459
oh you made it doesn't directly talk to

02:05:13,469 --> 02:05:27,789
web idea so in order to for example get

02:05:21,459 --> 02:05:31,449
a right-click right now you cannot

02:05:27,789 --> 02:05:37,030
directly bind to the Dom API yes because

02:05:31,449 --> 02:05:38,679
there was a proposal thank last night it

02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:42,579
was a few months ago I don't know if

02:05:38,679 --> 02:05:45,010
it's fixed by now but it was like there

02:05:42,579 --> 02:05:48,609
was a proposal so improvised and we

02:05:45,010 --> 02:05:51,879
directly get the

02:05:48,609 --> 02:05:54,849
get to call the Dom API including the

02:05:51,879 --> 02:05:58,570
right click left click events but that's

02:05:54,849 --> 02:06:04,979
not implemented yet so whatever IDL it

02:05:58,570 --> 02:06:10,780
does is generate Pluto ice cream cone

02:06:04,979 --> 02:06:14,949
that emulates that for you so I'm pretty

02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:18,070
sure if you like take the Firefox dev

02:06:14,949 --> 02:06:20,369
dev tools now for your demo should

02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:24,789
actually have a lot of jealous people

02:06:20,369 --> 02:06:28,719
that is not as you can see the

02:06:24,789 --> 02:06:31,989
description over here it is actually

02:06:28,719 --> 02:06:35,979
talking validly to the idea of the

02:06:31,989 --> 02:06:42,369
browser only this yeah it's a zero cost

02:06:35,979 --> 02:06:47,979
binding it doesn't talk about it

02:06:42,369 --> 02:06:54,550
directly generated yes it does a bit

02:06:47,979 --> 02:07:05,369
some it does it does say zero cost maybe

02:06:54,550 --> 02:07:12,849
the changes corrected I had a project

02:07:05,369 --> 02:07:16,659
using this WebGL but even for that it

02:07:12,849 --> 02:07:20,859
had to generate JavaScript code for like

02:07:16,659 --> 02:07:24,070
accessing no I think I think maybe it's

02:07:20,859 --> 02:07:29,379
a previous version because right now

02:07:24,070 --> 02:07:41,039
they're actually separate the Texas miss

02:07:29,379 --> 02:07:41,039
versus the person is actually so yes

02:07:41,909 --> 02:07:58,119
connect all JavaScript also yes right

02:07:54,459 --> 02:08:00,550
yes console is there because it's not on

02:07:58,119 --> 02:08:01,570
the browser you have it no to but

02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:06,460
something that

02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:12,430
like 2002 I get on myself about the

02:08:06,460 --> 02:08:15,190
Maidan you can't be corrected by hand

02:08:12,430 --> 02:08:17,050
but it still generates a lot of

02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:21,700
JavaScript so that blue coat that you

02:08:17,050 --> 02:08:24,700
had to yourself now but this as far as I

02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:27,820
know they haven't got it out yet

02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:30,460
you sure that like in the demo you had

02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:35,230
the right click left click right okay if

02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:37,780
you open the dev tools the Firefox dev

02:08:35,230 --> 02:08:40,300
tools and inspect the JavaScript files

02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:42,820
that come in I'm pretty sure that there

02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:48,430
is a lot of JavaScript for coming from

02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:50,920
the web sees cradled right so you

02:08:48,430 --> 02:08:54,460
actually are run running a lot of

02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:57,910
JavaScript for each time that you talk

02:08:54,460 --> 02:09:00,480
to Don like being those you click events

02:08:57,910 --> 02:09:00,480
or something

02:09:25,510 --> 02:09:28,699
[Music]

02:09:40,110 --> 02:09:43,200
[Music]

02:09:56,290 --> 02:10:18,530
would you go to the top oh please oh

02:10:15,770 --> 02:10:23,840
yeah yeah right there it was invented in

02:10:18,530 --> 02:10:25,760
90s life I can breathe it seven right so

02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:30,620
these these are the Joey's if they're

02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:34,220
gonna be emitted by so when you call an

02:10:30,620 --> 02:10:40,310
event once that Joey's input will be

02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:43,280
executed but but I'm pretty sure they

02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:46,490
are like optimizing it heavily but still

02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:49,010
that line seven to the end at that part

02:10:46,490 --> 02:10:55,040
that is in ninety years is what is going

02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:58,070
to be emitted and in chrome friendly six

02:10:55,040 --> 02:11:01,030
five six months ago this was slow just

02:10:58,070 --> 02:11:05,030
calling those functions a lot like

02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:07,370
10,000 times to a lot of time hey I

02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:09,640
don't remember the numbers was something

02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:14,490
like 40 milliseconds 30 milliseconds

02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:17,760
nothing fire was only Firefox it was

02:11:14,490 --> 02:11:41,280
too many baths you crawl it was really

02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:46,290
slow the last sample is all yeah push

02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:53,940
sample Rosco mini turbo strength you can

02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:58,110
go to oh yeah

02:11:53,940 --> 02:12:26,910
and then if you look at the sample this

02:11:58,110 --> 02:12:33,570
is what strength you can look into this

02:12:26,910 --> 02:12:44,040
sample I have the routing handling and

02:12:33,570 --> 02:12:50,420
then the scrolling storing the scrolling

02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:59,240
handling is good enough for you to do a

02:12:50,420 --> 02:13:03,090
production project from this sample and

02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:05,390
then the last slide is this one you can

02:13:03,090 --> 02:13:10,040
connect with me on this one

02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:10,040
this both inbound

02:13:25,949 --> 02:13:34,289
all right one question I have I guess in

02:13:32,590 --> 02:13:37,150
your background you saw wider area

02:13:34,289 --> 02:13:40,809
previously and you just call it the rust

02:13:37,150 --> 02:13:45,269
so would you say you believe exciting

02:13:40,809 --> 02:13:48,670
customer asked you to stop you will go

02:13:45,269 --> 02:13:57,400
down a thorough when we do not use this

02:13:48,670 --> 02:14:00,849
dummy depends on the project requirement

02:13:57,400 --> 02:14:05,789
if you want the if the customer want a

02:14:00,849 --> 02:14:09,309
quick deployment a quick project then

02:14:05,789 --> 02:14:12,249
it's better you use regular because

02:14:09,309 --> 02:14:15,610
there's a tons of components libraries

02:14:12,249 --> 02:14:21,130
available which is really very much it

02:14:15,610 --> 02:14:27,999
you can just prepare everything for the

02:14:21,130 --> 02:14:32,050
long term I think go for us rust

02:14:27,999 --> 02:14:40,409
Dominator is very exciting for me I look

02:14:32,050 --> 02:14:43,719
at it is kind of perfect to me lon

02:14:40,409 --> 02:14:50,920
because everything is you have to think

02:14:43,719 --> 02:14:54,249
in a synchronous and even you can put in

02:14:50,920 --> 02:15:02,499
multi-threading and then binary side

02:14:54,249 --> 02:15:08,710
also can handle better so if you are

02:15:02,499 --> 02:15:13,809
doing a project this dozen doesn't have

02:15:08,710 --> 02:15:18,249
the constraint of timeline then you you

02:15:13,809 --> 02:15:21,489
can go for it lon rush but if you want

02:15:18,249 --> 02:15:25,030
to do a project for customer that is

02:15:21,489 --> 02:15:28,320
looking for three months then you die

02:15:25,030 --> 02:15:28,320
you're using Russia

02:15:31,550 --> 02:15:37,969
so this will be our in case madness let

02:15:34,679 --> 02:15:45,420
us say Allah by me upload a baby video

02:15:37,969 --> 02:15:51,540
yes question

02:15:45,420 --> 02:15:55,320
so if let's say run Muslim I write for

02:15:51,540 --> 02:15:57,480
the van Beveren Obama so for the lower

02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:59,820
right when it builds if there is no

02:15:57,480 --> 02:16:02,969
logical reading books as that applies to

02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:04,830
the web as well you're right sometimes I

02:16:02,969 --> 02:16:08,060
don't I don't I don't know whether it

02:16:04,830 --> 02:16:10,800
was about I just write the code Atlantis

02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:13,469
if you do then you should have any

02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:15,080
program does it is he the same on the

02:16:13,469 --> 02:16:22,980
background

02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:25,860
you mean Russ programming yes yes yes if

02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:28,980
it doesn't come power you cannot

02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:31,219
compound if you can compel him it works

02:16:28,980 --> 02:16:31,219
already

02:16:38,689 --> 02:16:47,780
the comparison have a lot time slow

02:16:48,290 --> 02:16:53,460
because this it doesn't actually come

02:16:51,359 --> 02:17:02,670
Bama you can see the result immediately

02:16:53,460 --> 02:17:09,960
even if even if you feel for this yes

02:17:02,670 --> 02:17:13,200
you can have a lot of bugs in there

02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:16,679
padam building rescue you you will

02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:30,260
really have I think hardly you can see a

02:17:16,679 --> 02:17:38,790
bus if you get something something and

02:17:30,260 --> 02:17:43,219
it won't happen I think I haven't it

02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:43,219
doesn't happen something undefined

02:17:45,949 --> 02:18:22,979
you must be able to come they have

02:18:21,179 --> 02:18:28,500
something more to add the photo during

02:18:22,979 --> 02:18:33,800
the top oh yeah

02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:44,519
just now I forgot to talk about this one

02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:49,229
and this one if you are using in the web

02:18:44,519 --> 02:18:52,279
development it will be actually fastest

02:18:49,229 --> 02:18:57,840
lap for binary transfer things like that

02:18:52,279 --> 02:19:05,429
it is actually better than the proton

02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:11,790
path of red buff pattern it's actually

02:19:05,429 --> 02:19:20,420
better this one is fastest so you do use

02:19:11,790 --> 02:19:20,420
Jason I do use this and as I said

02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:33,179
[Music]

02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:50,379
[Music]

02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:57,900
something also let's say you don't like

02:19:56,280 --> 02:20:00,540
talking about the secret

02:19:57,900 --> 02:20:07,320
then I mean it's quite interesting to

02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:10,860
see this and I think about is somebody

02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:13,140
to Virginia so so the top of all this

02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:18,330
the army time is different from ours we

02:20:13,140 --> 02:20:28,050
are talking discussion but they just do

02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:30,510
good stuff they don't really give up yes

02:20:28,050 --> 02:20:33,780
to think I see one project called fish

02:20:30,510 --> 02:20:37,430
fish our location there fermentation

02:20:33,780 --> 02:20:41,790
completion is committed as I was taking

02:20:37,430 --> 02:20:44,220
what are you good if they hear us will

02:20:41,790 --> 02:20:51,090
they be they came they proved

02:20:44,220 --> 02:20:52,830
overwhelming yeah kind of yeah so what

02:20:51,090 --> 02:20:55,680
they do is very nice to do a small

02:20:52,830 --> 02:20:57,240
they'll take a Python original one they

02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:59,880
threw out all the function to cover the

02:20:57,240 --> 02:21:01,140
rust then then they just they don't want

02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:04,020
us to be issued and the people from

02:21:01,140 --> 02:21:06,180
online we just come and the people there

02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:09,540
they work together and then they say

02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:12,360
they can see even that can't anybody

02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:15,470
could play around they go all about

02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:18,720
stuff and easy you do you'll be helpful

02:21:15,470 --> 02:21:20,300
like they just go to the meetup and then

02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:23,580
they just do something together like

02:21:20,300 --> 02:21:27,900
they take a quarter of life then they

02:21:23,580 --> 02:21:29,430
just do the basic one is it can see he

02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:30,990
talked about this one just fight that

02:21:29,430 --> 02:21:38,010
when you go vertebra it goes archived on

02:21:30,990 --> 02:21:41,070
also excel with quite fact I see you

02:21:38,010 --> 02:21:42,780
over then he must express that then they

02:21:41,070 --> 02:21:48,300
can learn as well

02:21:42,780 --> 02:22:05,100
Oh Roger for Bella you deal with a

02:21:48,300 --> 02:22:08,840
situation where the God can I introduce

02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:12,060
the first one that introduces marijuana

02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:15,600
Shigella teachers of paper

02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:17,970
some people even assure that they asked

02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:20,790
me not when their chemistry lab so they

02:22:17,970 --> 02:22:23,670
just they also do the together mr.

02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:26,430
Bertram oh I'm not trying that I am then

02:22:23,670 --> 02:22:30,750
they think there are also other kinds of

02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:32,430
one stomach that just blew right buddy

02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:43,020
they are glad that we've ever had

02:22:32,430 --> 02:22:45,360
something yeah you should so one of the

02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:50,130
things that they do they do any D racing

02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:53,100
and we do email mixes so you can have

02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:56,130
them Appetit right it's really depending

02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:59,310
on how fast your you can only pregnant

02:22:56,130 --> 02:23:01,680
perhaps it is called typed it into your

02:22:59,310 --> 02:23:03,750
new because you have to do like that one

02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:07,020
piece at a time so I'm going to do now

02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:09,870
we need to be pasta - it's a racy the

02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:11,300
one in each the intestines or we can go

02:23:09,870 --> 02:23:14,910
into something and compete with other

02:23:11,300 --> 02:23:17,220
processor game for if I'm sorry

02:23:14,910 --> 02:23:19,440
competition Nevada so you do not have

02:23:17,220 --> 02:23:25,110
done you don't run a score is coverage

02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:27,630
right track then the name is covers so

02:23:25,110 --> 02:23:30,660
then if game called the forest and

02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:38,990
singing so it's a game you will not put

02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:41,820
and then it will make it into a salad

02:23:38,990 --> 02:23:44,970
architecture you combine them then you

02:23:41,820 --> 02:23:48,390
can tell police went to the other result

02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:50,580
to freeze back together then you can see

02:23:48,390 --> 02:23:54,080
there's a competition monkeys I think I

02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:54,080
was target receiver

02:23:58,181 --> 02:24:01,181
okay

02:24:19,750 --> 02:24:22,909
[Music]

02:24:42,681 --> 02:25:11,241
oh you give me thanks a lot work with

02:25:05,211 --> 02:25:13,641
the rustic so this one has done better

02:25:11,241 --> 02:25:16,131
cooking - that's why le is like this is

02:25:13,641 --> 02:25:25,451
one of the test project is until did in

02:25:16,131 --> 02:25:25,451
the MV equal a white boy but you know

02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:49,971
young extensa yeah so they have they

02:25:47,211 --> 02:25:53,181
have a branch to be extensive equality

02:25:49,971 --> 02:25:57,521
are not yummy very some prototype I mean

02:25:53,181 --> 02:25:57,521
they're not very the world

02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:04,350
also everyone is waiting for hello p.m.

02:26:01,739 --> 02:26:06,859
to support this pesto because West LLVM

02:26:04,350 --> 02:26:11,250
supports it not just frost crystalline

02:26:06,859 --> 02:26:13,979
all fishes primo organic seed will see

02:26:11,250 --> 02:26:16,560
over the our vision a lot of the

02:26:13,979 --> 02:26:19,830
transpilers that go from their language

02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:50,580
to LOV n will be able to write or ESP

02:26:19,830 --> 02:27:02,810
gratuities the problem is very so right

02:26:50,580 --> 02:27:02,810
now are uning

02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:09,620
