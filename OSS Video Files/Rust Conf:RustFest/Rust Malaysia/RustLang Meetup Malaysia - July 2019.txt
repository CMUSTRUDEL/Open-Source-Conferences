okay I can see so shiny

00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:43,940

already starting this may not no one

00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:56,570

speaker will be a free from the CEO from

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:36,430
what you'll be talking me yeah baby here

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,430
we discover you become a walk okay now

00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:49,010
okay so today is today is gonna be a

00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:50,630
very very simple talk so the what I

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:55,160
wanted to share really quickly is just

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:58,459
the how to get started with using rest

00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,459
with with weather so one of the key

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:03,470
things that like people like to use one

00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,090
of the key things that people usually

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,940
say I'm using aggress is very good for

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,430
especially because it's a great like so

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,900
it's great to compile it to lesson

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:19,700
because whereas it is like web assembly

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:21,709
language is one of the see yeah so

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,430
basically it's an open-ended for

00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:26,989
targeting like compound for compiling

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,790
which is to target in the browser and

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:35,060
it's already like kind of GA in the

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,890
major browsers so now is a really good

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,920
time to sort of get started learning in

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,860
it get started with using it as well one

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,430
of the cool things about it is that you

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:48,170
because it's because of its a compiled

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:51,860
kind of binary you get some of the

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:54,230
benefits that you don't get when using

00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,690
say JavaScript to script your browser so

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,940
things like being able to directly

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,879
access memory and directly manage memory

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:05,090
as well as the level graphics yeah so

00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:07,190
I'm gonna share today the kind of steps

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,540
that I have to use in order to get

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:14,060
started with my sec with rust and

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,780
whether I'm going to be going very much

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,880
from this book here which is very useful

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,100
basically

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,990
oh well sorry isn't sharing my screen

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:31,540
okay okay

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:33,940
grab my check yeah no no use use those

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,800
as to them

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,400
okay so me to share my screen your own

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,680
plate okay so to reiterate and I'll be

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,670
sharing about China basically compiling

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,180
from compiling from rest to weather yeah

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:52,060
very simple basically sharing how I got

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:57,900
set up with it basically because it's

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,900
not as easy as you would hope as of now

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:06,460
theoretically yes but it's still kind of

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,690
messy thing to get it working with like

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,200
actually having it in the browser

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:14,830
financially yeah so this is the kind of

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:17,530
angle and then I can we can continue

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,100
further on if you know yes extra time

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,340
basically

00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:25,210
so again started first of all you need

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,710
to have the rest of the set up so the

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,680
first thing is basically having making

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,600
sure that rest stuff is available for me

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,290
because I'm running arch you know I

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,320
should I so it's just as easy SVA arch

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:46,270
yay rest stop and then I had it there

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:48,760
already I mean you can you can also

00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:52,090
install rats directly from the efficient

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,430
installer but it doesn't using less that

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,650
has some had some niceties to it

00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,500
obviously makes it easier to do a bunch

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:03,430
of stuff so once you install rest up

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,170
then you would specify the you specified

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,020
a distribution so when I initially

00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,480
install rest up and I try to run like

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,740
rusty version it basically gave me a

00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,070
terrace and you haven't defined the

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,490
version yet so actually go back so that

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:26,440
you can see that there we go no default

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:28,030
to chain for figure yes so then you just

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,180
have to install the stable version and

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,259
then

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,880
so set it to be default so once you do

00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,979
that then that makes it the default to

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,979
change okay

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,090
no yes I believe so

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,400
so this one is specific to well so did

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:59,030
it did install the rest version for x86

00:06:49,400 --> 00:07:01,130
before they knew I deferred to the

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:25,030
Masters on that because I'm still very

00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:25,030
new to this I just did it and that's ok

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,919
[Music]

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,430
ok cool so yeah first of all first of

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,870
all have you a restful chain set up

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:55,340
basically and then you also want NPM to

00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,220
be available because of your gonna use

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:02,949
NPM to actually connect up the rest

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:08,900
generator of item library with web side

00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:13,370
and then you also want the so you want

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:18,310
this to always intact so this actually

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:21,830
functions a bit like wet tech for wisdom

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,440
so it helps to kind of compile wisdom

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:28,580
into the way compiles the kind of rest

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:32,899
stuff that you do create into into like

00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:36,140
a package with right yeah

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:37,969
yes not just transfer so it creates the

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,129
wiser but it also creates the wrapper

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:43,250
did that browsers will meet to actually

00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:48,879
load amazonian basically yeah so this is

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,879
all generated by Wes impact yeah so and

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,310
I believe it because of wisdom itself is

00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:01,910
only supported by evergreen process

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:04,310
right now so you kind of no need to

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,569
target because basically it's right ok

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,750
if you don't support promise House

00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:11,360
Republican support wiser yeah or any of

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,560
the other things yeah so installing this

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,560
it's very simple

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,870
it's just a matter of curling except I

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,879
realized that it tries to write to use

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,560
the pin by default so you need to go

00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:25,639
here but don't still go unless you know

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:28,939
what it's doing obviously yeah or sudu I

00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:31,279
should say yeah ok great so that's

00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:32,720
pretty much the stuff that you need you

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,120
just need that stuff empty and then you

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,759
read the lesson pack okay

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,500
I think in a bit of a fast-track because

00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,379
of what I did is I used cargo generate

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:46,069
to actually generate a template project

00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:47,899
from github repo so let's explore the

00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:50,269
template project real quick right so the

00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:56,629
template project comes with these two

00:09:50,269 --> 00:10:00,470
Basia so lived on RS is the actual rest

00:09:56,629 --> 00:10:04,430
code that we'll be running so let's just

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:08,000
you know this we can see and what it

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,309
does is set up some global alligator

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,899
stuff and then specify our function

00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:18,230
which will be later and this external

00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:20,449
here is to call out to Jas so weathermen

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,389
bind Jen actually is like think of it as

00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:27,889
kind of like the bridge between the JSI

00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:29,480
and website so because there are two

00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:31,459
different targets for the browser right

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,720
now they're still trying to figure out

00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:35,139
like how these two are going to

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,939
interconnect so as of now for example

00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:39,949
Jas can access the ligand memory that

00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:43,189
was amuses but wisdom cannot access any

00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:45,050
GS objects so when you try to in order

00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:46,910
to access any Jas objects you need to

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,410
use this way so my generation can think

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,899
of this as like having being the bridge

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,740
between them so you want to call things

00:10:50,899 --> 00:11:32,749
like

00:10:51,740 --> 00:11:34,009
window yes yes yes exactly so it would

00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:35,059
require the rest to know a lot more

00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:37,910
about what the target that you're

00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:41,240
actually targeting yes so as of now rust

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:44,629
itself doesn't compile this stuff it's

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,660
quite intact that composite so that's

00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:49,670
why it kind of doesn't know as much yeah

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,129
so as you say as you see is basically

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,259
just regular as impact though so what

00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:58,639
was intact bill does is it generates

00:11:54,259 --> 00:12:02,449
this package which gives you a package

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,519
of JSON it gives you a TS text quickly

00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:12,649
and I'm not entirely sure why and gives

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:13,879
you text good I'm sure as of yet we

00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:18,079
don't yes yeah this is the technical

00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:21,139
definition but also okay so each of

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,179
these right that's interesting that

00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:27,949
gives you a taxi definition for the

00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:30,199
Wiesenthal strange okay

00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:33,170
but anyways and then you have this thing

00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:35,329
which basically imparts the wisdom and

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:42,079
then defines the actual function that

00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:44,540
will be called later and then finally to

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:49,549
use it in a web project you need this

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:52,490
you need this like you need to also

00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:53,899
import it from the package and then

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,490
actually call the function so there's

00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,069
two levels or indirection here that's

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:02,620
this is calling dog breed dog breed is

00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:04,010
actually defined in here as this and

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,500
then this

00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,580
is actually calling this so I mean you

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:13,040
could technically I passed that one

00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:16,130
ever-loving direction I suppose yeah

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,960
sure yes this is all generated by the

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,030
way so everything another pkg here it

00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:31,010
was all generated and everything inside

00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:33,290
of the W here also is this is a yes yeah

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,510
so this is just basically like think of

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,180
my career I have this awesome app

00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,380
basically that life has all the

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,430
boilerplate that you need in order to

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:47,390
consume Rus generated by some packages

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:52,940
yeah so if you take all those steps

00:13:47,390 --> 00:14:01,520
right then you can basically inside off

00:13:52,940 --> 00:14:06,230
the inside of the inside of the double W

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:09,640
folder from NPM run start and then yeah

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:20,270
you have fewer Rus at running inside of

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:22,510
the inside of the browser any questions

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,510
so far

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,730
you would have to react our imaginary

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,850
especially if you're building a building

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,570
very rarely imagine you can do on

00:14:34,850 --> 00:15:01,550
materializer

00:14:35,570 --> 00:15:08,960
you published immediately and yeah is

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:11,990
that reading which I thought yeah I

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,740
thought it's like just transpiling kind

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:21,440
of the same way attacks

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:28,550
that's all okay okay so it like actually

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:39,020
generates so that's pretty much it from

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:41,120
actually we're looking at it right now

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,700
before a making any right now for a

00:15:41,120 --> 00:16:03,890
cha-cha processing library on the front

00:15:43,700 --> 00:16:06,920
end so one of the things that yes

00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:12,290
they are very slow yeah so give you

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:14,690
example of this one yeah so our current

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:19,880
charting system is it looks like this

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:21,590
basically so this is quite limited this

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,260
we limit the number of chats reading

00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:26,480
yeah there's actually a lot more chat

00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,120
types the reason why we limit is because

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,620
of if you push like a thousand thousand

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,270
five shots into people's browsers

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,620
generally their browsers don't like it

00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,140
yeah

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,930
also as you can see there's various

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,820
different chart types as well so we're

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,390
kind of thinking about whether it makes

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:47,180
sense to actually do the drawing which

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:49,310
was them and just have them all be

00:16:47,180 --> 00:17:00,370
canvases so that you can keep your

00:16:49,310 --> 00:17:03,370
accelerate the out of it yes

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,370
exactly

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:17,340
there is WebGL bubble gels actually

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:23,000
because you have to do shaders mean

00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:23,000
there's a rainbow for this yeah

00:17:38,550 --> 00:18:08,190
oh right there

00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:10,500
what's the performance like okay right

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,680
this is a visitor very there's very good

00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,770
reason why most finance applications are

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,990
still using desktop yeah it's because of

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,790
the web even in the web democratizes

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,790
access to it no one has been able to get

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,519
[Music]

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,940
you can

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,290
so we tried that with the trust that we

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,240
have right we're going to assemble a

00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,160
dashboard that's like you know like that

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:47,880
was that got like hundreds of Chester

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:49,310
and it just slows down that's why you

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,600
yeah

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,100
so that's one thing that one one

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,890
possible way that you can actually use

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,590
wet very nicely obviously people talk

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,240
about games you know games doing the

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,850
game program in your shipping games that

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,890
are in the browser this I think another

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,680
project actually compiled quest them to

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:10,290
run in the browser as a my kids earth

00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,520
it's a kernel so many more kernel

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:15,100
running in the browser which is quite

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,559
cool and then

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,779
Oh another thing no we are very

00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:23,110
interested in actually will be

00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:26,230
statistical analysis so if you can do

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:29,679
math very fast in the browser that will

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:32,799
be nice yeah especially math related to

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,799
demo yeah so if let's say you have

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,370
access to low-level lunar phone graphics

00:19:35,799 --> 00:20:28,440
programming right actually doing things

00:19:39,370 --> 00:20:39,509
like yeah

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:41,740
if any you guys done any rust - okay any

00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:59,129
anyone on the livestream have any

00:20:41,740 --> 00:21:03,509
questions or any comments - chain is not

00:20:59,129 --> 00:21:05,830
my first originally when I thought the

00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:08,110
people wishing rust that's why they are

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,820
the best experience for using

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,559
progressive right tensor was not as

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,019
employees I thought would be still you

00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:15,970
still have to piece multiple pieces

00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:18,940
together like I showed you so already

00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:21,580
you kind of have to have a bootstrapper

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:25,570
for your MP on side you also have to

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:27,330
have a you we're not yet at the point

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,880
where I can just draw for as a bundle

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,880
into a browser into an index.html just

00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:36,590
you know script module tourism including

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,590
and include resume that just works

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:46,140
sure I do think that the pace of change

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,750
right now is quite fast as well so

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:52,470
that's why maybe there is an established

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:54,840
way of doing things yeah yeah we are

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,610
also very very nice partition of rust as

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,630
well so yeah one of them like I said

00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,970
it's one of the main reasons for

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:03,570
explaining it's just beautiful chopping

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:06,780
for being able to ship kind of like good

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:24,110
data applications directly to the user

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:27,540
browser let's try and see that's wasn't

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't think so

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:39,990
I mean they did that POC where they ran

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:41,820
in Firefox Firefox ever need any cool

00:22:39,990 --> 00:23:09,810
things that you saw people do is rest

00:22:41,820 --> 00:23:13,050
with o/w it's pronounced June or no it

00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:25,500
says it says that you just workers

00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:34,860
oh no yeah yeah wiser man trust oh damn

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:37,500
then it's pretty sexy my god although

00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,100
although all the hipster passwords it's

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,100
my invite

00:23:46,889 --> 00:25:12,750
yeah one of the main things that we need

00:23:55,090 --> 00:25:12,750
to know it's yeah yes Desmond of

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:27,989
[Music]

00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:50,759
spectrum not section why not

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,870
yeah there's a very very nice cashier on

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,400
JavaScript collaboration that talks

00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:41,890
about how you eat what you do if you

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:43,750
want to can you use this very okay in

00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,850
any case I mean oxide sounds like a

00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,540
perfect thing to be in crust right yeah

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,450
exactly

00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,240
but because the name oxide is probably

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,100
related to rust

00:26:51,240 --> 00:27:02,440
no actually the language that is much

00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:09,220
more JavaScript II I think is what is

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:10,540
used to write yeah oh and he knows me

00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,530
because you just write JavaScript you

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,530
don't need to write me rest

00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:21,160
yeah

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,559
and he knows really nice very very very

00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,720
excited for how much people are even the

00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:28,840
community I like you know contributing

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:37,570
to it I believe it should be very stable

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:43,210
soon actually they they move from go to

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:47,980
rust as the base the original proof of

00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:50,920
concept that Ryan Reid was so it has a

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,600
v8 engine and then the actual like

00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,850
system interface bingo

00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,850
but now is really written it to rust

00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,440
but yeah I don't know how long we'll be

00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,510
at the one priorities but yeah you know

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:20,730
because very enterprising we have to

00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:23,280
wait no no this is beautiful because you

00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,690
realize that basically the structure of

00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,309
it it's exactly like browser JavaScript

00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:29,610
so I don't have this issue with like

00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:31,530
okay if X is not available you know like

00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:38,100
all these other inconsistencies that

00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:38,940
Ryan introduced with exactly yeah which

00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,850
is very beautiful

00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:49,160
yeah yeah really really really really

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:49,160
nice project actually yeah it's very sad

00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,150
the thing is that talk about they know

00:28:52,440 --> 00:29:13,860
the mostly tight scrimmage hours could

00:28:54,150 --> 00:29:16,230
not rest I don't know it is nowhere near

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,830
ready for production there's like

00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:21,050
security issues all over the place

00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:23,970
look at that look at a number of issues

00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:34,230
would you feel comfortable using this in

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:53,960
production fixed time Apokolips intimate

00:29:34,230 --> 00:30:00,120
ideas good okay thank you very much yeah

00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:02,070
very very simple talk so I will

00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,330
disconnect do you want to come here and

00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:06,440
play

00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,440
[Music]

00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:14,500
or use the sweet energy no that's why I

00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,500
say you wanna come with me

00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:32,959
[Music]

00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:46,710
[Applause]

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,710
[Music]

00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:10,000
[Music]

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,000
so now

00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,390
[Music]

00:32:17,380 --> 00:33:38,140
- so you better stop worming the thing

00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:38,140
that you want to learn is should handle

00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:53,059
the concept first first one is salmon so

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:57,929
usually you want to assign a value of b2

00:33:53,059 --> 00:34:01,100
to a name so in Python movie something

00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:04,770
they also value so in Russ you do that

00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:41,599
similarly just a little bit of

00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:41,599
difference so ctrl e to read this demon

00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:53,460
immutable and currently cannot be

00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:59,300
changed when accommodation so if I add a

00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:07,640
value to it it should prove an error

00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:07,640
because by default available cannot be

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,500
[Music]

00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:17,200
manipulator of animated planning the

00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,950
fire

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:58,630
later when during the program screen we

00:35:20,950 --> 00:36:02,140
need to have this moment then we would

00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:04,299
have this is shrinking and we would have

00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:08,109
numbers we can do the same thing for

00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:11,020
numbers as well so if if you can see

00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:14,799
from the previous example I did not

00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:19,450
specify any it had had into the salmon

00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:20,319
because by default the Rahab is right in

00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:25,079
the Kabbalah

00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:25,079
so if mother explicitly specified

00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:37,540
[Music]

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,540
you can do so

00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,389
[Music]

00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,020
so

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,280
yes

00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,410

00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:56,850
by default if you if you put in prison

00:39:53,010 --> 00:40:16,130
one big number should be is always

00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:16,130
defaulted to mention is how especially

00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:35,809

00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:33,670
[Music]

00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:16,870
the 46 if you leave out the same so the

00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:23,380
greatness is being slow is slower than I

00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:23,380
initially expected okay then wouldn't

00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:47,390
well unlike pattern everything is in

00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:52,880
location same follow falls so they are

00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:56,390
need to enforce key plus whatever none

00:42:52,880 --> 00:43:03,190
is doable and eternal death will not be

00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:03,190
covering as you be using nano purposes

00:43:04,930 --> 00:44:22,660
so we things which is this is how you do

00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:27,859
mathematics or other basic mathematics

00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:30,789
then we have this brain depending on

00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:30,789
where you come from

00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:44,409
[Music]

00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:51,049
we can also have a list of names or

00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:52,219
strings you know Russ we call this very

00:44:51,049 --> 00:44:56,380
but yeah

00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:56,380
everyone everyone needs different things

00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:25,669
this is basically a release look I can

00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:31,579
run so like I would say this a lot

00:45:25,669 --> 00:45:35,859
that's a difference between string by

00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:41,209
STR and string in factors and arrays

00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:44,900
however usually if you want that's a

00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:48,949
very convenient way like too many play

00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:56,329
game because what I defined so far the

00:45:48,949 --> 00:46:01,640
strings and crazy then you cannot change

00:45:56,329 --> 00:46:05,919
change money by decimal time so if if

00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:13,539
you have plans to manipulate the string

00:46:05,919 --> 00:46:13,539
right the ring you define different and

00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:33,170
[Music]

00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:16,050
[Music]

00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:32,359
[Music]

00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,940
[Music]

00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,530
[Music]

00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:08,480
I know how you define

00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:24,480
also when you define a string this the

00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:29,880
size needs to be fixed

00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:33,869
it is know the keys to know how so

00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:37,430
the size of Korea cannot be something

00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,430
that cannot be

00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:49,140
is always face and always be visible so

00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:55,980
if you plan to change the capacity of

00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:59,130
the list want to push things into a

00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:02,000
string in future so the way you do this

00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:07,740
is you define them differently and

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:19,470
usually you start by defining in this

00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:24,600
way because they come with some methods

00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:40,860
that helps attack that perhaps into too

00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:44,039
many so once this is done

00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,039
[Music]

00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:04,159
[Music]

00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:18,199
[Music]

00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:43,920
[Music]

00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,229
[Music]

00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,210
[Music]

00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:11,789
so we have yeah if you want to print the

00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:14,849
result

00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:39,210
yeah because machine does not return

00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:41,190
anything so if you really want to see so

00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:54,269
this is how you clean things and the

00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:56,549
same time not somehow the format this is

00:51:54,269 --> 00:51:59,339
the first macro that you see anything

00:51:56,549 --> 00:52:03,089
that is followed by s Commission monkeys

00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:09,559
micro the reason I make is my pro

00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:13,289
because line is made to accompany body

00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:18,319
types of things so if I think the funny

00:52:13,289 --> 00:52:24,839
is a tool to implement it as a chrome so

00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:30,779
we have also factors which you box

00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:35,089
promises live like stringy example so if

00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:35,089
you plan to manipulate the

00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:41,910
if you want to buy into a huge

00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,929

00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,889

00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,900
[Music]

00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:37,050
like so it can also shred all things in

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:39,500
different time for example if I have

00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,500
this

00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,880
[Music]

00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,879

00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:51,809
[Music]

00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:12,410
but

00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:36,219
[Music]

00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:48,880
[Music]

00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:56,070
so if a crane here I will expect string

00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:06,760
however I can also in the middle of

01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:09,390
description I can change it with

01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,390
something

01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,679
[Music]

01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:06,570

01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:46,470
- this is the shorthand for the change

01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:51,210
the value to something else that is not

01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:53,460
relevant to what you define visually so

01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:56,849
shadow me is kind of useful when you

01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:59,960
have scope but for the sense you will

01:01:56,849 --> 01:02:09,770
have some other things going on inside

01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:09,770
plants so now I'm wanting to be a string

01:02:11,540 --> 01:04:21,740
so I have is different because my card

01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,740
is this

01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,610

01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:23,759
coactive okay we can also define range

01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:23,759
of values

01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:51,409
[Music]

01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:14,579
[Music]

01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:45,830
in general you can spend roughly that

01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:50,270
was you can trust as something that is

01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:57,690
love that would not be receiving much

01:09:50,270 --> 01:10:00,720
change so if second branch we would now

01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:07,430
become a branch room which is the if

01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:10,430
statement it's nothing fancy just this

01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:10,430
something

01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:19,640

01:14:46,830 --> 01:15:14,580
this plus last thing that people show

01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:17,710
you in programming is reading function

01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:27,580
so when you create a function the syntax

01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:40,210
is not too fancy also have this followed

01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:42,699
by a list of arguments yeah everything

01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:46,750
inside documents it needs to be defining

01:15:42,699 --> 01:15:51,850
very especially you cannot expect the

01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:56,550
column to imply what the data is - you

01:15:51,850 --> 01:16:03,010
know when you create a function defined

01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:06,570
it is so in Rus the last expression is

01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:06,570
always between so you

01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:25,040
when the right man Jesus kisses like

01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:25,040
this it's good to check with enumeration

01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:41,820
because this is so powerful people use

01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:45,929
this for everything so I'm not a fan of

01:23:41,820 --> 01:24:01,969
abusing match kisses where if semen is

01:23:45,929 --> 01:24:05,640
more obvious but you find you can also

01:24:01,969 --> 01:24:07,770
look in different ways so if you come

01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:14,699
from functional background you may find

01:24:07,770 --> 01:24:32,250
this very very very hopeful so can have

01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:33,270
Map Reduce so this is how this is how a

01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:36,960
piece of mandalas

01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:40,770
so as I mentioned sound Russ always

01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:45,320
returned the last expression so you can

01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:51,850
actually and meet Amit Amit

01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:51,850
of the racists if you if you intend to

01:24:53,980 --> 01:25:50,240
solve this is allow you to change

01:25:44,380 --> 01:26:37,160
together like this everything has to be

01:25:50,240 --> 01:26:40,850
the same if it returns a string then

01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:45,200
because if you write a treatise like

01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:48,250
this Russ party for personal different

01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,250

01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:56,689
will briefly talk about coffee title

01:28:53,879 --> 01:29:01,579
copy that is just something that

01:28:56,689 --> 01:29:01,579
implements so that

[Music]

01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:58,989
I actually think yes okay so therefore

01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:05,540
borrowing is actually not able to things

01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:15,770
that happen it could be easily in the

01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:17,000
memory so doing what most people are

01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:20,389
talking about

01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:23,750
in every single presentation that they

01:32:20,389 --> 01:32:26,650
do so let's start from something online

01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:34,639
you define something that is horrible so

01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:42,280
it can be strange this case let's say if

01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:52,969
something that is stealing from this

01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:57,290
book this will throw me an error because

01:32:52,969 --> 01:33:03,850
the ownership the code is polishing is

01:32:57,290 --> 01:33:03,850
now the value here is now owned by this

01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:12,410
because yesterday she moved from this

01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:48,559
this will not look also because the

will saying

01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:34,430
right off is the reference is contact

01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:37,469

01:35:50,579 --> 01:36:04,380
pointing thing moves horrid you know I

01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:04,380
do this once you once you listen to this

01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:17,499
so once this function is done excluding

01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:19,960
no one is pointing to the oh because

01:36:17,499 --> 01:36:29,349
this is not pointing to the vending then

01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:51,269
the function or finish sorry if I don't

01:36:29,349 --> 01:36:51,269
know yeah you can do pouring pouring so

01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:59,499
this is something that is similar to

01:36:54,690 --> 01:37:02,079
other languages but you know there may

01:36:59,499 --> 01:37:05,769
be some differences but I've been

01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:15,999
dealing with references for quite some

01:37:05,769 --> 01:37:22,499
time we just pass in the reference so

01:37:15,999 --> 01:37:22,499
that the original one still has friends

01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:13,319

01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:45,689
[Music]

01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:24,390
so this is like I said you read the

01:39:07,449 --> 01:39:24,390
practice but no one has this

01:39:32,750 --> 01:40:44,849
[Music]

01:39:37,679 --> 01:40:44,849
yes one holding the movements once this

01:40:44,969 --> 01:40:47,969
nobody

01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:37,080
[Music]

01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:09,340
but coming from the garden see it's more

01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:14,430
yeah

01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:36,640
[Music]

01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:44,739

01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:50,729

01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:34,479
[Music]

01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:44,380
if

01:45:45,190 --> 01:45:49,320

01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:28,390
[Music]

01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:37,679
the thing that bugs me a lot about

01:47:35,219 --> 01:47:51,210
immunity do you develop some sort of

01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:56,100
intuition of things to be so you if you

01:47:51,210 --> 01:48:01,920
can cause that each one gives it that

01:47:56,100 --> 01:48:05,250
kind of area right insurance when you

01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:09,080
write to prank us yeah but I really

01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:09,080
don't see it as my primary language

01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:36,819
[Music]

01:48:42,830 --> 01:48:46,189
