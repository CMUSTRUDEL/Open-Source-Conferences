you

00:04:22,480 --> 00:05:37,400
okay okay he just tells you how you can

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,370
verify your software but in messaging

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,710
for us I found that the stream after

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,320
using gospel I thought that most of the

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:48,229
time we would need to verify whether

00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,200
this whether this one uses or you didn't

00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:53,960
ask for the text so instead of testing

00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,600
like in maybe in JavaScript that very

00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,530
loosely coupled languages so you

00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,570
probably be has been checking that all

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,120
over the library whether whether you

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,340
passed in the current time or checking

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,650
is checking that my wrath most of it

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,750
already had the welcome all of you and

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,000
they will stop your memory have my

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:18,640
really shoes that you will start reading

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:23,780
issues just don't news not safe then the

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:27,200
ghettos and okay so and testing in rust

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,990
me when nearly just has pelagic usually

00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,919
so that really has English

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:35,500
enter in case your washer unit test just

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:38,860
test a stinker mania starting a library

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:44,139
small unit like punctured small ship in

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:59,370
the official test you can test the test

00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:59,370
material components by go-between so

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,869
[Music]

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:12,570
Russ maybe must is fast compared to a

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:15,039
particular tip like with Brett IV GIP

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,740
the answer for me just man a G you can

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,470
search for your air duct with dust is

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,780
that like breath you know where your

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,960
search for specific Turing Maroubra NASA

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,699
craft that are they requested search

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,340
across everything they acknowledge even

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:32,380
you for all the stuff you just search

00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:37,120
what here anyone they were search for

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,520
you it's very fast and always I said no

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,600
I just a few but they are news that will

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,280
grab FD in fact

00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,780
so if you nice come on fine but it just

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,660
kept empty and they just have what mean

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:52,540
we're going to find aside finish come on

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,430
but we're also very fast just rough

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,500
Mickey crazy to paralyze them

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,540
I think you're so they're just really

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:36,310
that's all call the sparrows if you and

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:40,320
then you can just very fast this way

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:43,090
senator or very much Anita said with

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,190
here s is a cheap it equipment for you

00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:49,450
to be able specify as well

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:52,200
oh isn't that so actually spices up

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,200
don't eat that

00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,040
it's just ridiculously good we shouldn't

00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:03,210
have any me later how and omega4 might

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:09,550
have expected house which actually

00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:15,090
civilization serialized input so why we

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:19,030
use those as an example is that it is

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:21,520
optimized for ease and speed at which is

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:24,850
equal terms on the street and also the

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:30,300
output in the equal above is much

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:37,870
smaller than give get back or

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:38,920
tell us what we mean by is one more

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,990
piece

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,990
[Music]

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:07,600
I find useful is that talkie-talkie is a

00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,560
Japanese word for coming

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,160
so it's a very sweet name brass and it's

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,160
passing correct

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:19,270
I use this screaming usually as you saw

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,880
this that possible

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:30,720
written by Facebook for quickly do like

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:35,040
see that the fun part no you like fast

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,040
finally taste throughout your project

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:46,300
movie yeah FST mo d I use perfume okay

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:49,630
what the I to so we de Grasse but it's

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:54,010
not he's not saying that's not fun

00:11:49,630 --> 00:12:01,320
because he doesn't it to be so fast if

00:11:54,010 --> 00:12:01,320
there's not called back so that is like

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,860
[Music]

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:16,660
so these are few toes okay unicasting

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,440
that's W me happy Halloween Unitas in

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,690
rust here us you can only start to fall

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:33,340
care the show very hard work very simple

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:35,790
and x and y this is imperfect and it's

00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,790
per meter

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,850
[Music]

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,129
[Music]

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,209
- Queen

00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,510
[Music]

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,150
haha

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,040
[Music]

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,559
[Music]

00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,990
[Music]

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,549
[Music]

00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:06,470
yes the whole there is no Russ

00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:16,940
this is just something equals something

00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:16,940
very yes they structure

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,700
[Music]

00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,609
[Music]

00:19:51,370 --> 00:21:12,800
okay okay okay yeah m-pesa so keep your

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:15,140
output right so your duties free miss

00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,120
Becky Batta rusty part where you have

00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:22,610
you can visit all right you returned one

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:25,780
you can also put it about a dvg expel me

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:29,950
a lot and then forget in the 5x negative

00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,950
2xy so

00:21:41,950 --> 00:22:22,970
yeah my application you also get the top

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,210
so when you're writing applications

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:36,580
halfway you don't test you just put it

00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:42,080
back and you can see the application

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:46,190
when you run Joe Russell so getting

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,140
faster and if yeah just to their testing

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:53,060
here a second time you've just run he

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:57,470
wouldn't like one the messages cat

00:22:53,060 --> 00:23:01,520
and next example oh yeah to show you

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:06,620
that we can ignore this test you just

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:09,020
add we know that you will run so if you

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,990
do you know you can just ignore those

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,530
tests that Phil it's a pretty much worse

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,560
than that

00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,700
all most of them like now okay now just

00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,750
ignore them

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,750
I want to go to the next section

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,400
Oh

00:23:46,430 --> 00:25:02,360
okay yeah because a lot testin testin

00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:22,110
for us just because we also works then

00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:25,830
probably basically i okay so then you

00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:28,190
need your help expect with us expect if

00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,190
you panic

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,029
[Music]

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,809
[Music]

00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:41,200
we'll cover top and then you can

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:55,240
obviously you just it doesn't right so

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,240
we will show

00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,619
[Music]

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:40,840
because something so

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,609
[Music]

00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,359
[Music]

00:31:51,830 --> 00:32:02,850
yeah yes my god so Oh penny

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:07,380
use Kies music in documentation there's

00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:10,320
a rest api time example then you take

00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,690
the possible penico panic so to copy

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:18,300
this code panic this is now something

00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:23,490
that we usually very always put them in

00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:27,890
and present dangers to say one is panic

00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,890
and the other ones the non photo arrows

00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:39,290
[Music]

00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:39,290
yes yes

00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,230
yeah

00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,840
[Applause]

00:37:39,130 --> 00:38:03,530
and so it was okay yeah hey - hi it's

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,200
not stable yet because there's also a

00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,970
risk they're doing national well the

00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,190
right of the statistics for you the

00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:14,109
graph is for you every commit you to the

00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:17,290
graph it for you design isn't just true

00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:20,420
also there's no standardization I call a

00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:24,260
they are coming out with some RC to do

00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:29,140
that but not yet but for need I have so

00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:29,140
just a venture and then just three oh my

00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,930
yeah

00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,580
you want to test one bench mum was so

00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,050
you just put this back from up there

00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,990
they bet that box and then you know

00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:08,050
before series ice and then if you like

00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:09,880
reduce the speed so there's just a

00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:13,240
periodic by the church to say that and

00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:16,960
the Vice is for showing that quite got

00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:22,090
MB per second way to go how am i how

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,310
fast can we do 100 meters again by the

00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:27,390
car through it

00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:29,500
just just to show you the truth and then

00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:31,420
if you use it right at the end there

00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,960
will just have 150 and people's again

00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,960
yeah

00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,909
[Music]

00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,539
[Music]

00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:16,459
if this CRI then there's two for that if

00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:28,339
you miss the eye then there is miss kau

00:44:16,459 --> 00:44:33,829
you will ever suspect - would you be

00:44:28,339 --> 00:44:40,729
able to run and be able to tell which

00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:48,469
functions are equivalency or the voids

00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:50,979
of all we know Russ you know see which

00:44:48,469 --> 00:44:50,979
lines

00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,520
[Music]

00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:50,380
so he

00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,750
[Music]

00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:45,780
so you can yes it's not well largo y

00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:48,670
equals we find out in cast prefix rust

00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:51,340
the past is the past

00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:52,210
Michael somebody Godfather flonase that

00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,490
I feel dirty

00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,200
maybe within a morally you can put me

00:49:54,490 --> 00:50:03,970
tell me where somewhere you can just put

00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:11,760
that fast go yes madam bench that fails

00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:11,760
is no no the best just for checking the

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:27,580
know they support this criterion bench

00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:31,390
TP messy MP they show you the benchmark

00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:37,480
competitive to this this right you know

00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:40,690
this you know this right so you say nice

00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:43,060
people you say you say this into 1/2 and

00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:46,330
you see the new world version to another

00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:48,160
file well compared to patch some people

00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:53,170
they need to water or to better then you

00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:56,250
have epigram car car ball Sabathia men's

00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:59,500
TMP to compare the bench between two

00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:00,940
between older Padma and a new one so

00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,740
they were just tell you the statistics I

00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:05,980
is how many percent faster than previous

00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:11,260
one and then how much is it faster ready

00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:12,790
a lot criteria so that's that but you

00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,920
need to you need to do it in a different

00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:17,680
way you need to write the arterial test

00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,750
in a different way but quite even the

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,910
when you do the best part right you get

00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,910
that can do that in this show

00:51:34,160 --> 00:52:04,960
so let's see help finding anything you

00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:07,819
can just go this library it's not

00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:15,259
community return man that crystal I hope

00:52:07,819 --> 00:52:17,830
is a notorious this one is different you

00:52:15,259 --> 00:52:20,989
get like this

00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,989
[Music]

00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:38,180
we just write the so you can write the

00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:40,660
best part of this so you just do this

00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,950
behind and they'll show you a liar

00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:48,140
they just show you a liar and then they

00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:57,009
also get come on it's a craft the demon

00:52:48,140 --> 00:53:00,200
provide the graphing so you can reports

00:52:57,009 --> 00:53:02,660
right you get these every release or so

00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,839
you can release you get back how is he

00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:15,369
performing is he going out without

00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:15,369
something like why the car great

00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,969
[Music]

00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,530
[Music]

00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:49,950
are we idea are we yet every gym yet

00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:54,180
yeah with you I a lotta years

00:54:49,950 --> 00:55:08,460
yeah and I'm glad for us a really fast

00:54:54,180 --> 00:55:20,850
yet also we they got RV but yeah we are

00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:24,190
we turning yet we IDs now therefore

00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:27,130
different comedies

00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:28,480
so these are re idea and decide the

00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:31,510
language server for us

00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:35,430
so language so which one is suppose

00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:49,329
oh is he oh yes code but yeah like

00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:53,589
everything official implementation my

00:55:49,329 --> 00:56:08,170
second official EP medicine for rustling

00:55:53,589 --> 00:56:13,750
service so should you be using machinery

00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:18,190
per se is no see a lot so it's very meta

00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:21,099
are eating yet Avengers forgiven jeans

00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:24,579
and the shirt tons of game again I read

00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:27,430
I recommend New Jersey oh this is our

00:56:24,579 --> 00:56:34,359
gift 95 very cool game even dress they

00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:36,430
put the host PDF civility and so their

00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:40,500
strategy meeting roster spot on the

00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:40,500
slope now they also show you what

00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:44,540
[Music]

00:58:26,739 --> 00:58:54,039
yes looking for us okay it's not that

00:58:51,109 --> 00:58:54,039
high it's just I

00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:21,060
[Music]

00:59:27,070 --> 01:00:19,849
so so we can start writing and while

01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:22,130
you're exploring like you know something

01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:24,260
very easy to read I recommend this yes

01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:29,180
this is really easy right you get

01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:31,490
something this one is different

01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:37,040
I fix my is that you do all the rock and

01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:41,290
then - oh thank you guys you just do all

01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,290
the wrong and then that you put in

01:01:10,260 --> 01:02:45,760
so you just if you serious or what form

01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:48,340
and format you just do the same thing

01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:55,990
okay an example I can show is some

01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:58,720
quotes i return i return is memory for

01:02:55,990 --> 01:03:00,960
commercial between multiple multiple

01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:06,730
zebra

01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:14,560
this is a CR q MF j 7q m l8 just the

01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:18,610
team mmm no I did I haven't yet your

01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:25,630
buyers I haven't yet

01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:27,369
so how come well is just she was very

01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:28,840
busy design yes they abstain in the

01:03:27,369 --> 01:03:34,560
basis so you just covered like using

01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:37,930
this so certain have the libraries if so

01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:40,810
in math for the structure you you will

01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:42,550
just be something like how many IDs so

01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:45,040
you just put serialize and deserialize

01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:47,920
yeah and then you see right it for you

01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:51,550
you can see recite share your attic to

01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,680
Jason or what insert it so they don't

01:03:51,550 --> 01:04:01,440
differentiate you just use whatever even

01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:01,440
come when you just remain is basically

01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:12,429
from John is fine you have to keep the

01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:12,429
[Music]

01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:21,730
mask yes just puts your life and then

01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:23,530
means that this is serializable so you

01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:26,109
can just serialize and then you need to

01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:29,410
put in this point your fee structure is

01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:32,109
already implements civilized so this is

01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:36,790
cogeneration then placed on this they

01:04:32,109 --> 01:04:39,580
generate the code for you if you're the

01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:40,570
chip you can still not take here you can

01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:49,510
just ignore it

01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:54,460
using just recommend you can because of

01:04:49,510 --> 01:05:00,820
rocky so the employees when we see like

01:04:54,460 --> 01:05:10,780
actually is actually probably you can

01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:14,250
play this device so if you want decent

01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,250
you want envious

01:05:34,640 --> 01:06:41,660
so so so here

01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:27,120
okay okay what pushing to dance okay

01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:27,120
