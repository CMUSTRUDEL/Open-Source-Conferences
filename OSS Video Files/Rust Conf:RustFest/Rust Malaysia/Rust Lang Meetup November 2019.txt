00:01:25,310 --> 00:02:45,049
hello hello hello

00:01:29,570 --> 00:02:48,799
hello ex-factory s I'm recording on okay

00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:53,180
okay so this is a rough line Malaysia

00:02:48,799 --> 00:03:00,040
without and this is like quite a few

00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:00,040
times already now okay

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:18,390
okay so welcome to read up yeah so

00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:21,180
pressing rather or no this like this is

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:25,440
one already one year follow the bra

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,079
rustling meetup Malaysia and the meetup

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,299
started like team ready ad we saw this

00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:35,519
year same pace ago Canadian and last

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:39,629
time a perceive all hospital once a man

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:43,430
and then now we make it one every to man

00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:49,290
to make any consistent hurry too much

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:56,750
the the middle are done on every second

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:59,549
Wednesday on the two of two months and

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:04,620
right now until now we have complied

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:06,930
total of a meet-up and this design is

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,440
one question you'll get for shooting

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:19,229
viewing the phone just by any idea was

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:23,370
that no so there is there are some

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:27,020
connection is really asking how many

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:30,419
times you happy here it means a zero

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,180
finger one of them were I don't remember

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:36,270
so you come too many times so it's zero

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,770
one very yard and there was one time you

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:43,889
will have to pick up a loved one so I

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:47,250
think very nice grab that and of course

00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:50,760
we thanks thanks to dr. E and once they

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,800
are co-hosting us yeah

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,800
then next

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:08,300
okay so the next next one very much with

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:09,920
us know visually if something ever yeah

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,170
we're discussing the news I forgot to

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,970
say right because the other meetup

00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,910
groups have been doing is I think you'll

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,530
be quick to share something new just in

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,270
case you didn't keep up with it a new

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:24,710
site we just should have been something

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:28,250
interesting yeah here so since last two

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:34,420
months the rust 1 point 3 and one more 3

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:37,760
9 this one that was in one portrait if

00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,580
there's a correctness lien now Russ the

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,890
The Rock Kampala mention while the mem

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:51,610
and engineer initialize and 0 e typical

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:55,610
and the next is the difficult macros the

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:57,470
deprecated macros is to use for each use

00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,630
but can be used by library authors now

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,230
to mention that they are polished be

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:06,080
picketed and you your one there and yes

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:10,880
a weight is over the weight and then

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:16,160
anything F friends are here now now the

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:25,130
is a stable is already it's already

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:31,670
stable yeah so the now we can just use

00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:34,210
the assessing away with us and have you

00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,210
seen I think

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,310
yeah this the last version is a be the

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,860
final version

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,080
at first they have discussion and they

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,979
they do we call version that the pick

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,590
two then the final two lines the find

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:53,060
out who is the difference between it's

00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:57,800
very similar final to it just one is

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,990
post picture - prefix and I know chosen

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,699
one if prospects because it plays nice

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:07,009
with the question well yeah and but you

00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,570
see prepared in most other languages do

00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:12,289
you know any we all know any language

00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:14,570
just is postfix away yeah what their

00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:18,199
main arguments for prefixes just because

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,849
of the compet of the similarity with

00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,620
other languages but they just post back

00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:24,289
here because it's better for the

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,289
language they fit well and it just

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:31,330
because constant constant friend they go

00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,330
now they just put in more constant and

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,720
yeah I just know I think FN the I think

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,520
a friend is not available in

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:45,199
implementation inside information right

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:50,289
entry entry but there is a quick for

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:54,219
that they call anything I think rate and

00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:56,060
you need to run the procedure macro if

00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:58,789
bye-bye yeah but there's a trick for

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:02,599
these to let you use a singer then this

00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:04,460
would have got post on that but the only

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,849
one stable if the main the normal

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:11,560
functions that I think and next is the

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:14,270
bore chakra now hot now if I was ready

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,449
you know that's a Portugal raided

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:23,210
stitched with a new chop-chop follow me

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:29,419
hold on a search or yeah this is to the

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:32,089
new born checker in wrath one three five

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:35,870
somewhere around there and then the new

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,409
brochure cool suppose neol now because

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,219
I'll be ready

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:41,990
and then the fountain arrow so so and

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:46,100
right now only addition 28 including

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,950
that addition 2015 it's not using that

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,350
now now they are one they are one

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,730
put it back I think they put it by

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:59,000
already but now they are planning to

00:08:52,730 --> 00:09:02,529
remove it in 1.41 zero the over checker

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,850
so they just migrated to the new one and

00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:07,339
the last one is a tribute song function

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:14,060
it's quite surprising you see the the

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:15,500
bottom one yeah you can see you see I so

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,260
because if you would cross that's

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,540
alright you you wouldn't originally you

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:25,100
need to write TFG windows and need to

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:27,529
write a land for just a different input

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:32,240
type and then you need to write one for

00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:34,040
not windows you it you know this one you

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,920
need to put this outside and there's

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,690
this whole thing except this line let me

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,199
put one and then you need to do another

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:45,529
copy of these down so with this one you

00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:48,339
can just I just put water of course the

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:50,990
it's not just you have D not just you

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:56,690
know just safety you can use it for like

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:59,870
penises okay and yes rustic officer is

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:02,990
still getting faster and they're there

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,579
the first one is on the post how how

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,730
they make because effing away this year

00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:09,649
now so the the problem is cut how to

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:19,040
kill it improving the performance of the

00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:22,040
schedule the second post is Madeira the

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,769
modulus talking about how they input the

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,980
performance in compilation compulsion

00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:29,449
time there is no dis compiler

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,449
I think in COBOL performance working

00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:36,649
group there so there's focuses on

00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:39,290
improving the compiler speed and the

00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:42,560
third one you all know 40 degree macros

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,810
right the Easter Egg is a macro to just

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,300
generate code on top of you run run that

00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,180
can run some code based on the inputs

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,010
the token stream you provide like based

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,079
on a quote you right there you run the

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:59,480
procedural macro can help you to modify

00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:01,300
your quote and what what is what David

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,690
only tornado

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,990
in a crate that helps you to it allows

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:10,990
you to pre-compiled the micro into

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:14,800
wisdom instead of every time you run

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:18,880
right every time you run you need to do

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:22,209
your game and the mo mo mo walk with

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,070
them their focus on that and mentioning

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:26,830
how they use what and how the

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,779
performance increase increases from what

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,570
I saw if the performance in the drop

00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:33,880
from the increase is like effort the

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,610
compilation time is around 10 to 20

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,950
seconds with after the kampala to work

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:43,750
relatively their compilation time

00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:46,899
brought to life once again yeah oh oh

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,459
few seconds it's a lot faster but you

00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,089
just need to Campari and tribute the

00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:57,760
recipe you know certainly supports what

00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:59,080
so if you use sir I think because I

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,920
think you've got pull the ad I measure

00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,620
them if you want the slice our online

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:10,959
retailer one can just I'll put a link in

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:14,320
a bag and the last one is Russ one more

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,450
treat they introduced the vine

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,430
compilation so this one when he works

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,829
for if you have multiple crates that

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:26,980
that's that's like depending on each

00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:30,520
other so and there's a pipeline so let's

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:33,490
split into like metadata and compilation

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:36,160
phase something Treme that so when they

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,450
are populating the metadata all already

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,579
are coupling they can just take the

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:43,750
metadata and use it for another quick so

00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:46,140
if something like that you have D you

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,459
have this compulsion

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,910
first combo followed by second right now

00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:56,740
part nine is like the generator metadata

00:12:51,910 --> 00:13:01,720
here then I can I stay so they can tell

00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:07,779
me that any other article regarding

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:10,480
these no okay now they're in a recipe

00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:13,570
show their blog post a couple blocks

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,800
like last year Russ writing ID they also

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,509
call for both but DC

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,179
they're asked like what the Edition team

00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:21,279
would be saying of course different

00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:24,389
people put some blog posts and share the

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,230
ideas you know you can try to share you

00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:28,989
can write a blog post

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,999
anyway a one righty and turn it to the

00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:33,879
right community community him and

00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,860
they'll review it or you can you can

00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,049
check out if you're interested to stress

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,470
or ideal they should all the blog post

00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:43,269
will be ruled by the rusty members so

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:46,959
they were there evaluate an NDA will

00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:49,899
discuss and trade in one man in this man

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,829
I think mother you ready

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:56,709
and all the blog post that is related to

00:13:53,829 --> 00:14:00,819
this Russ trendy traditionally is in

00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:04,920
great well so it rushes our poster a

00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:07,059
little aggregate order articles

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,610
something similar to between brass

00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:12,459
except they just a bit of them you say

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,350
because this this way in rut is

00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:17,350
selective so that's like the article

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:21,040
says only not mentioned and something

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:23,769
unique also a special we're a great most

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,549
of the particles so they also have a

00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:26,549
category body

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:34,990
okay next call of the week you are

00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:37,269
seeing all the way either one part of

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,600
the dis we bra so I just randomly pick

00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:43,089
one of them and just a side right

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,019
hammock concept I should have known

00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:50,379
like we're writing steep as well yeah

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:52,749
record also greedy first one said every

00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:54,730
time like this this film and they're

00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:58,689
putting it like quite a few times

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:01,600
already and this one I think also quite

00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:03,999
true I heard from a few post online

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,869
where they learn new concept because

00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:12,879
ownership goes it is available in super

00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:15,850
father III but if not in what a

00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,579
requirement it's not like high drama

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,209
like Russ is you cannot break the

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,209
auto-ship rules

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,350
okay additional religious ownership this

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:32,019
one I miss one night schools and slice I

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:36,829
will be available here

00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:39,980
your can go to this thing you on the

00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:46,579
side all the size of this and YouTube

00:15:39,980 --> 00:16:01,490
channel it's already whittling in shape

00:15:46,579 --> 00:16:05,209
like a beautiful angel pickling about

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:08,259
any questions any questions regarding

00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:08,259
the UN

00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:50,249
we can phenomena like a colander

00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:38,970
or in their Couture 1944 you think

00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:38,970
anything awaiting wrath yes one

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:56,980
and we're detecting a rainbow yeah this

00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:00,040
is wonderful was also finding these

00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:04,330
people in progress book but yes is

00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:08,910
explaining the icing away here on so

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:12,100
this is one night good in introductory

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:14,140
that to like learn and the mobilizing

00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,320
with but there's a working group

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:27,450
although the although that I think a we

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:29,500
broke is not healthy yeah anyway so

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,920
because I didn't keep track off the out

00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:35,260
group

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:40,360
so so Phi it so and then now they are

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:44,170
doing the type the pet web type so what

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,790
they want to do everything to make that

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:49,270
ecosystem better but yeah this is their

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:51,280
book your voice you still wouldn't

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,740
progress mini because the raw setting

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,320
away just a polite recently but there

00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:02,290
are quite a lot down here or the if you

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:06,940
can see the rust dr. Rand also have some

00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:09,490
anything away port and including this

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:18,130
week in this wing Russ there's quite a

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:19,690
few recently because because of because

00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:23,830
of the introduction and it needs quite

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:26,710
new so people people explain that how is

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,320
I think a rework some bother about the

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:40,300
internals and some about how how do you

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:42,810
D so these are the resources today yeah

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,810
besides me

00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:53,529
oh okay

00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:00,039
today I remember I allowed that for some

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,039
time already

00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:19,960
so this effing SVD cybersyn degree but

00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:19,960
with everything

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:31,729
yeah this one yeah so therefore book but

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,429
uh but if I not not necessary and I

00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:36,109
think I think FD you just assemble area

00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:41,479
but with the air thing anything away

00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:44,960
anything away stuff I think it also

00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:49,909
mention that maybe I didn't read this

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:53,929
new book but the a dish to Peter should

00:20:49,909 --> 00:21:02,379
be a good guy for the anchoring reading

00:20:53,929 --> 00:21:02,379
on that left a little okay

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:21,099
ingenious without space engineer my

00:21:47,590 --> 00:22:03,159
Oh buddies no official ones oh ok ready

00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:05,169
go yes GMT ok thank you

00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:29,899
hey hello

00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:36,879
so sounds oh and then a boom ah

00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:36,879
yeah yeah

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:58,470
Oh tell Allah has been there multiple

00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:05,760
choices at the end I chose with the

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:12,900
postfix away there are there's a blog

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:17,510
post about the compressor where's the

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:40,800
pasta they explained on a JavaScript

00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:46,620
gasket and comparing 24 shitty that

00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:50,630
these are yeah yeah release another

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,630
process will go online

00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:23,230
I don't remember always being that the

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:25,930
link is explaining oh yeah sorry

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,660
the difference is now is 0 cos preachers

00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:34,120
let me keep the do celebrities in

00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:35,560
between and is the future we not run

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,290
until it's a waiter

00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,540
I like the dollar promise where you just

00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:44,730
do a comment anyone but a rate is

00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:53,410
something that some familial observable

00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:58,030
when you know country is the way same as

00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:59,860
the JavaScript one so it is I the the

00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,160
way is just when you create promise

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,730
right

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,880
you ran a quote by the rust is rust

00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:09,160
weight is different is that when no you

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,460
created the future it won't run the

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,420
future will run but until you await that

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,280
you dot the way that thing that you run

00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,320
so it's something like the October if

00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,840
you know if you know what the October so

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,090
right of the world when you subscribe to

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:30,490
the October then Eve or near under

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:33,790
render quote rust future you see so you

00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:36,420
only run the future where when you pull

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,420
for the result

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:59,590
yes honey you wait then you execute

00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:03,970
through that's the main difference right

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:05,470
and but the yeah the differs from other

00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,429
languages is also they are using the

00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:11,440
prospector right yeah the reason the

00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:14,140
sound we discuss is on the question my

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,210
operator because it fits like you can

00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:20,440
see if you don't use the postfix then

00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:23,470
you along and to break it away and break

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,640
it away yeah and then at the end you

00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,640
need to like something I did

00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:10,900
come here when you were weightless

00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:14,590
future one you run away try like you

00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:20,559
await and then your customer and await

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:22,809
the second and function to on for the

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,660
second future and then your way again to

00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:28,840
get like the result

00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:33,460
like these are but if in this case you

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:37,720
will be something that future one don't

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:42,760
away consumer then you want to use this

00:27:37,720 --> 00:28:00,220
data you just you just run function on

00:27:42,760 --> 00:28:02,760
this please so uniform oh yeah then you

00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:08,070
have another function

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,070
yeah so if you go back again

00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:28,730
from it

00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:31,380
Thomas you need Dan right because like

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,390
the one of the reason they argue that

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,340
this one is better is one of the

00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,930
arguments like this is that they want to

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:41,490
avoid this and they'd only get this

00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:45,930
comma then if you want to see a way you

00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:48,330
away this but easily that you just stood

00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:55,560
first and then after that you say you

00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:59,430
wait for you one funny dish and one in

00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:02,250
the the one is for the fishermen and

00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:08,790
having a lot long break at night in the

00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:10,650
stream line makes it harder for it now

00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,260
because this one is the this will

00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:15,300
turn the result in the second position

00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:23,100
yeah so the question is just a error

00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:24,780
propagation away it's not a function

00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,880
laughing laughing they wanted to do

00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:41,220
ideas in anything if they do that it

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:42,690
will be confusing quaters something in

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,010
there but it's not it's not property

00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:49,460
lighter Kshama the city-owned computing

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:49,460
maybe I Percy

00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:12,950
oh wait yes oh yeah forget here now

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,020
because they say if a way that I'm sure

00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:18,980
you confuse a lot of people because a

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:21,080
way is not working here so there when a

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,450
problem this is also like they why

00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,590
should we be actually look like a

00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:28,730
function than people with all ISA

00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:42,620
function but we just a waiting for the

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:44,870
Fisher if you have multiple awake know

00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:47,870
like not about wait there how what they

00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:50,990
do is they're just fine like future 1

00:30:47,870 --> 00:31:01,600
and then s future 2 is what it was and

00:30:50,990 --> 00:31:01,600
all the way yes these are the promise

00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:21,250
Raisa I don't know we shiny there were

00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,250
I'm not sure because I do check the one

00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:33,740
yeah yeah so now I will start it up I

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:36,560
can tell ok so the second thought would

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,710
be about no this refers all the first

00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,590
talk will be about contributing to us

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:44,000
so I discussed my experience on

00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,520
contributing to brass and I also

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,290
discussed and what is their wait what

00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:52,460
what do they do and yeah first that is

00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:56,390
before her to be the rust and you learn

00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:58,550
rapper I think I just read cut just

00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,809
about my journey in learning learning

00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:04,249
wrath

00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:07,609
so like pretty crazy 15 well you're

00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:12,649
rather oh right that all that really is

00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:14,539
not not long ago and then I cry is it

00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:18,889
whoa yeah

00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:24,139
and then I'll try it oh okay quite quite

00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:27,799
good but not not like very good I think

00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:32,179
I just got so that I see oh the guitar

00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:36,379
so hoping or ago so to our try me I

00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:39,979
thought it only 2017 where I'll try

00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:42,499
again Oh improve a lot and then it

00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:47,349
continuously improving is continuously

00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:49,849
improving and now we see that is a real

00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:54,859
posture of the most love languages

00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:58,969
they've also seen of your team you know

00:32:54,859 --> 00:33:09,200
phonetic team so what do you see rest of

00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:10,729
it is really happy in this well I've

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,080
seen done community that's not very

00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:20,330
friendly so if you send a pastor what I

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:22,309
say why why should I add this picture so

00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:27,049
they reject almost orbiter and kill the

00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:29,349
basically they don't allow you to pass

00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:32,479
to it's not like we're something else

00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:34,969
like some other communities but they are

00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:37,969
communities they are more reluctant to

00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:40,849
change Rossi is one of them days it can

00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:43,580
be easily changed anyone can go and just

00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:45,999
say I like this and then because it's

00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:49,779
not all one by a single cooperate right

00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:52,639
this is a what a say what do they call

00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:54,460
sustainability there's one post on the

00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:57,859
Russians and II like availability

00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:01,580
because I there's no single you know

00:33:57,859 --> 00:34:07,030
other totally I agree I was busy

00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:09,950
a non mother single like not a single

00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:12,889
organization without a standard central

00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:21,049
body or handy like success or something

00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:23,839
it something area no now nowadays you

00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:26,510
don't have no now there's no single

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,379
standard people tell me instead it's

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,790
just that people online they just work

00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:33,200
on these together and then they're there

00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:37,250
for different teams of working on that

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:41,419
yeah nothing like that so people there's

00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:44,659
no like say a single person can work so

00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:47,629
people everyone agrees and then everyone

00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:47,929
check comment a lot using our cheap or

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:53,480
that

00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:57,069
so is it let's see so yeah so the key

00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:00,109
inside the the main thing they always

00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:05,960
talk about you kolakozhi

00:35:00,109 --> 00:35:09,200
so the the one any they want it to be

00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,089
let us open for everyone so they'll try

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,960
to be very strict through those data

00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:19,520
type like slightest likes to school

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:23,329
school shop inside the community and

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,000
stuff so those people will like me not

00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:31,730
try not to it they will be likely less

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,339
likely to enter the community the the

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,260
moderators you will bet prevent those

00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:40,010
people yeah they are moderators checking

00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,260
those posts they will do it and if you

00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:46,280
centralize I the opposite decentralized

00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:48,440
and maybe those people are like those

00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,480
people who like challenge address it

00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,740
when you're percent I see I lost Resnick

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,780
quite complicated you need to learn

00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:57,130
everything at one shot so the Kabbalah

00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,500
Kabalah

00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:02,690
tries to build at your past and you need

00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,559
to satisfy the computer but of course if

00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:08,869
it combat and he works most of the time

00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:12,470
yeah so many people who like challenges

00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,150
and the learning resources so these are

00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,070
learning resources or Greedo on nice

00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:20,160
very nice

00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:22,560
except the detectable most of people who

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,150
came in letting gracias go through this

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,530
book first the rational brain English

00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:30,720
book we just quite a book yeah then

00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:35,580
let's wrap by example a conditional

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,410
example this also this decree including

00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:42,360
holo combination which discusses about

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:43,980
the API or offline so but if your

00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,460
interest by default you will get this

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,920
unless you select the minimal profile in

00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,500
one of the latest release for the rust

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,610
rust up to chain they let you select

00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:59,370
profile like mínimo or stuck in one room

00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:02,340
by so normal and that we use in the last

00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:05,040
one is complete complete is different

00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:08,160
from the long one in a case way it

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:13,970
includes me really Russ analyzer Russell

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:23,640
address for ID and I'm worried PP

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:25,080
things creepy yeah so but if you don't

00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,630
remember slating any of those that you

00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,130
get the book yeah the default include

00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:32,670
the reference as well

00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:35,130
nomicon and I don't think you have a

00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:37,130
picture domain books by default there's

00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,140
also and paper us so the others actually

00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:42,090
the master ah the accessor a period of

00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:47,180
maple section I'm not sure they were but

00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,180
of course we can see how this goes

00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:58,270
that's all so your us adult you open

00:37:51,490 --> 00:38:01,270
your browser for you then you can see

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:04,320
that there these are the resources it's

00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:07,450
all you know system oh it's already here

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,070
so you can just or you can even just

00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,350
type the shortcut you can go to the

00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:16,810
library you can press this a lot but

00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:20,530
usually I just do then the wrath up dot

00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:22,000
- - SPD so it's time for the library you

00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:30,869
can just search through that library

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:33,609
what right wait so you can come here

00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:36,850
yeah put it to the dog combination you

00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:40,230
ran over my right you running a

00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:44,140
playground and then you can also do like

00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:48,010
don't research book these are just a

00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:51,580
shortcut to let you go to the PDF but I

00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:54,730
like this right I don't know why did I

00:38:51,580 --> 00:39:00,550
color here yeah

00:38:54,730 --> 00:39:01,810
Nina's continued she is a good person

00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:07,180
okay now I'll be talking about the

00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:09,130
internals in in server side so be found

00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,960
the team butter cookies from somewhere

00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:14,050
the raster type they have the coding

00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,710
community in kabbalah team i all this

00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:19,990
all these kings write the code team a me

00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:22,930
they've come across him coming again

00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,010
comedies the diamond in a community Papa

00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,750
let him do a Kabbalah

00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:29,890
I think the compiler thing is quite sure

00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:33,180
their computer this Chris Donna

00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:38,020
I hope him diminish the infrastructure

00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:41,070
and all these different things you have

00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,070
any questions on the team

00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:48,430
indeed I also like King things are just

00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:51,010
different people inside a team and then

00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:53,740
they are working group they create this

00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:57,790
working group to specifically let the

00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:59,020
few people I get the packet a specific

00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,600
area

00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,660
and work on that side also so I think of

00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:09,600
it working guessing working group might

00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:21,880
be the first time ya think

00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:26,530
they disbanded so these are the

00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:29,140
different working groups across all

00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,120
these are in Rockland governor's the the

00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,250
redesign website and then they just show

00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,990
all the governance here so the image of

00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:38,680
who who are they who are a few members

00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:43,210
there and like in terms of the artsy

00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:46,210
process as if possessed by the request

00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:49,510
for comments decided centralized

00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:53,740
thoughts up so they're show how the

00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:59,370
thinking process how how other design

00:40:53,740 --> 00:41:03,400
being made they explain it out in my F C

00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:09,700
so they just explain that how how should

00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:11,500
it look like how they implement yes

00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:23,590
but usually they need to go through the

00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:30,520
process but is in a separate report so

00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:34,150
you see that there's this D so I've seen

00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,450
here can see you can you see anything

00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,080
away

00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:40,240
yeah so they discussed about the

00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:45,250
anything away like we do some real

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:48,460
motivation widening away the artists on

00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:53,110
you many poor useful some stuff that

00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:54,700
requires some something some design it's

00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:57,070
just small stuff that just a little

00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,580
appreciative about our season those the

00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:01,930
change quite a bit

00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,180
it's a recipe deeper

00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:06,630
most of the language design changes go

00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,630
through this

00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:17,600
I've seen no arty just the document so I

00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:25,430
see doesn't mean that they implemented

00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:27,200
it it's just the idea well because this

00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:30,770
one is already implemented and in the

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,600
unstable yeah they can run it that most

00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,570
of the new RC won't work because it's

00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:37,130
not implemented the RC or toast Brasil

00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:41,330
necessarily means that they need to

00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:44,960
implement it is just that they might

00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:49,910
want to like most of them implement it

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:52,070
but some dozen but anyway if you want to

00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:55,460
help with RC you can you can also help

00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:58,700
in removing there are see how they do

00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:02,840
how they do the design and you can

00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:05,510
reverse the net I'll show what on the

00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:08,690
experience on doing that like this back

00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,520
pain referral gut-level explanation now

00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:14,660
how to use in I and report there were

00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,990
explanation so the explain how this

00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,140
works

00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:20,720
they also explain how to implement it a

00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,990
bit sometimes no I have they also

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,240
discuss on the drawbacks you know like

00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,530
why why do they what if they don't have

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,530
this yeah

00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:39,400
so they evaluate most emotion they are

00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:43,040
really needed ok so lately the prior art

00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:46,610
like this year this one is to let them

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,740
know like which other languages you have

00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:52,420
the same thing or have their seen this

00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:56,330
somewhere else some is inside the own

00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:58,910
language in Surat itself but the trying

00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:01,040
to let other people know like why what

00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,590
leads to Weis one of the factors

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,810
initially and then they also mentioned

00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:09,310
an unresolved question which they were

00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,310
put in another outfit for that

00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:19,109
so many poor design changes first there

00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:20,640
will be pre RFC and PRC can happen

00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:23,579
inside are capable they are just

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,339
creating shoe for purity oh there we

00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:30,720
have there it can just cause it to rust

00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:33,030
the forums in to knows the section so

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,589
there there are posts are pre artsy

00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:39,690
there then people at boom boom boom

00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:42,510
comment or Allah commands then after the

00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:44,339
review review again and if everyone

00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,099
most people agree and the thing is nice

00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:49,920
choice they are put it into RT the

00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,510
percent of pull requests for RC in just

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,569
now the reporting or so and then they'll

00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:57,960
review again by the team sometimes the

00:44:54,569 --> 00:45:02,819
team you will like contact like I have a

00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:06,030
meeting with them online Kawa then let

00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:07,740
them put a final comment period so this

00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:10,170
final comment period is there like that

00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:13,410
a debacle week something at that - they

00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:16,650
were just spread the import of these RFC

00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:19,289
is being accepted or something like that

00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:21,510
and then you will be in the final

00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:23,130
comment period so if anyone's to comment

00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:27,000
so they want to make sure that everyone

00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:30,000
comment everyone that I can take a look

00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,470
at this line handy remember party and

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,849
then they'll share it with this week in

00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:42,029
Rus so you can you can always see new RC

00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:50,880
being created and then this way just -

00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:53,430
yeah - we don't have the plus button

00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,680
something that is just everyone agree

00:45:53,430 --> 00:46:03,809
kinda kinda like everyone agreed and

00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:06,740
they just doing yeah it's not really our

00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:09,930
past life even if everyone is like

00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:13,460
sometimes they will do that depend on

00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:16,529
the team depends on the language team

00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:18,809
like laughing that's why sometimes when

00:46:16,529 --> 00:46:20,880
there are like two different processors

00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,770
racing away for quite a while let's say

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,970
four choices they roll down to two

00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,470
choices

00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:27,600
and then they ever down for that last

00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:29,220
one then they in treatment last one so

00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,910
they go through a lot of thinking right

00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:35,760
today in an exit intimidation philosophy

00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:39,060
the lobby the RC Auto doesn't necessary

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,730
need to do the intervention the line I

00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:48,030
like to do our C so then someone else

00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:50,850
can do the information no FC already

00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:54,240
shows how it will look and you will try

00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:57,380
to address or sometimes you try to

00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:01,860
address that all the possible outcomes

00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:04,410
like to prevent an eel any and safety or

00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:07,260
what yeah just to make make sure that

00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:10,290
you don't show sorry to put yeah and

00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,240
then I'll play intimidation no UV

00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:14,760
stabilized your night I think we just

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:19,530
stabilized not long ago this week or

00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:21,170
nothing either and this committee so we

00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:25,740
need this other where you get news from

00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:28,740
block and you the rough dot it up here

00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:33,720
Dabra so they just put it under column

00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:35,880
embers maybe and interest may be this

00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:40,530
this one is discussing all the the a

00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:43,200
meeting and what are the inside yeah

00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:47,040
just in terror before it's more wall

00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:51,360
detail in internal file and this way in

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:54,230
Russ is just a general on everyone's all

00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:58,950
of articles online Paula jr. mm I just

00:47:54,230 --> 00:48:01,740
like to get everything and discussion so

00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:06,120
these are the two places where they go

00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:08,580
use it and introduce Jesus alike some

00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:10,440
level beginner channel and those cameras

00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:15,060
are there internet Armenian total

00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:16,590
Kampala or the king of the regime so

00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:21,549
likely to the side nothing more I want

00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:25,259
maybe you can say that shuttle Falls

00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:28,509
the last time was no no is Mimi B Scott

00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:32,499
klase Morrissey Arecibo your wife why

00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:37,509
Madeira want to why would ya stop the RC

00:48:32,499 --> 00:48:40,479
server then they stopped I think it's

00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:48,009
still running but not hey I didn't stop

00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:50,309
I know I know but now there's two people

00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:52,959
using RC but it's not okay sure

00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:56,380
like there are a lot of people you think

00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:57,880
I see but no no so people try to get

00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:00,969
over yourself go so they will get caught

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:05,289
some teams there himself in using too

00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:07,630
deep see me or nothing I think I'm

00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:09,789
really not free nor over 50 now and what

00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:13,749
sure but as I was on motivated by their

00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:15,819
called that so and then occurred after

00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:19,539
community calendar we will post our

00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:21,699
events there as well and the run

00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:24,069
committee under the shaded near a senior

00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:27,130
this week near us so you if you are in

00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:28,769
other countries and helpers helpers to

00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:37,539
be a race made up you can always check

00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:38,979
so you'll be there because I don't think

00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:46,709
I purchased one meter pony

00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:46,709
I will ask me that a big one O'Neill did

00:49:47,549 --> 00:50:01,089
the most reason let's confess in China

00:49:53,609 --> 00:50:03,659
no literally Lightning home I think on

00:50:01,089 --> 00:50:03,659
the last conference

00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:26,840
very interesting to see here okay so the

00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,210
experience is first the first changes

00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:32,720
the a prodigy usually I do the first one

00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:34,760
so you just linger on like there are

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,910
some broken links I just fit it what

00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:40,700
documentation I found some ways to add

00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:44,240
links to them don't like the roster new

00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,770
library there are some pasta if not you

00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,770
cannot click on a link and I want to

00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:50,810
click on it so I just add I see improve

00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:54,530
improve on everything documented or what

00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:56,360
is easiest way to help and you help to

00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:58,730
improve the user experience that if you

00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,640
try to write the documentation make it

00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:03,650
helpful so everyone can benefit for me

00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,870
yeah this way you just open up request

00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:09,730
most likely the work that I want to

00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:09,730
change all of the other different sorry

00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:20,300
depends on what oh so call this maybe is

00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:22,780
like one less than one day yeah

00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,780
definitely

00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:33,520
okay the next one and that's like

00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:36,570
helping out in the RC let's also the

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:42,490
first time you know it's not writing IRC

00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:45,340
yeah I see some RC online then I say oh

00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,720
this quite interesting but why not do

00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:54,340
this okay

00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:58,390
maybe I'll just show so this is I won

00:51:54,340 --> 00:52:06,160
cracking issue for for the FC compa I'm

00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:08,950
working on this I haven't done it so

00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,349
they have this friend RC you can see

00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:18,190
DISA they're checking for this RC then

00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:20,920
they have this rendered so this around

00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:26,580
the ocean of the are three papers I saw

00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:29,770
where here this is not here at first I

00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:34,990
saw this city accessible and this why

00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:39,760
why the repeat yes yeah huh why yeah why

00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:45,430
do they repeat this so they are just why

00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:55,500
not why not do this then I I go and then

00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:55,500
I look at a coat and yeah if you could

00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:08,020
yeah you started out we would comment

00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:13,000
and I got a real good one so I just said

00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:16,690
them yeah I did yeah all right you know

00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,760
I saw these and then I say yeah should

00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:21,070
we should we show a simple opening quote

00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:24,250
ready yeah

00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:26,560
they sure why not okay then just like a

00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:29,620
progress yeah just like that

00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:33,640
then you go wash so it's not it's not

00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:36,520
really that hard then you just music I

00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:38,890
put every good except most of the time

00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:41,410
just to type or just there are some I'll

00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:43,450
sit I see a lot of people like if you

00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:46,090
can find it just really halfway or typo

00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:49,210
you know those are the changes that you

00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:53,080
can help and this one is right maybe a

00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:55,720
bit more than typo and this one in the

00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,220
other one the same RFC I did it quite a

00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,470
thing but know why picking out there

00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:02,980
nothing watch Oktoberfest I was planning

00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:09,400
to do deep like on October by dealing

00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:11,200
combination computer so you they will

00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,700
have this tracking issue no one is

00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,340
taking out the edges I'd say I'm

00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,970
inserting doing this so they will they

00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:22,360
will give you mentoring attraction here

00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:29,200
yeah yeah so they give you way to start

00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:31,770
that where can you look this one is

00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:35,110
implementing an RFC

00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:37,570
so they did one is what they want to do

00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:41,080
these are field basically they want to

00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:44,080
add this CFG accessible so they want to

00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:46,870
know whether this function or deep item

00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:49,600
is available as of that moment if it's

00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:52,360
accessible then do this if it's not

00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,820
there inside a fallback in case there

00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:58,510
mechanism is not there so if you are

00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:01,570
using aqua model or their new stuff they

00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:04,020
want to work backward compatible so they

00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,020
can use it

00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:15,839
no it's not a macro you see Michael okay

00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:20,000
it's not I don't think it's normal it is

00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:20,000
computing Kabbalah is inside of a photo

00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:26,730
yeah something or they can say hello

00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,299
I need over be a few times and I

00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:31,740
understand can understand mighty the

00:55:30,299 --> 00:55:34,349
other compiler is quite big and there's

00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:36,510
so many different stuff there's the spin

00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:39,299
with the symbols and stuff yeah now

00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:41,010
they're try to speak stuff into the

00:55:39,299 --> 00:55:50,790
print great way they can share the same

00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:54,690
code between VP and Betina Betina under

00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:57,750
prototype creepy and the last official

00:55:54,690 --> 00:56:03,380
the miracle mother yeah they want to try

00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:08,930
and yeah just a few interesting ranges

00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:08,930
yeah this mattress can you shoot

00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:29,100
the other thing friendship Christians

00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:53,170
also can anybody look at the recipe no

00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:57,700
no my other recipe le anyways our

00:56:53,170 --> 00:57:07,170
company just to ask this of their wife

00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:07,170
have any question this ask because I say

00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:41,440
oh yeah Oh Sookie open Chrissa

00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:43,510
processing away now so there's the open

00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,750
one and geometry they tried their best

00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:50,020
to the people posting their migration

00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:53,170
blogs online so they are try to make the

00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:55,330
future squid and Tokyo Creek compatible

00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:58,360
a futures oh no that's the future zero

00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:59,920
country and you're opening one so they

00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,530
try to make it they put some

00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,030
compatibility block there to try to make

00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:06,030
the damn chain too easily

00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,670
no that's just poor migration to

00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:16,230
anything away because the previous one

00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:16,230
is different it's not it's not ID

00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:33,230
yes logics where even though it's very

00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:40,430
complicated

00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:51,200
I try to improve it something like she

00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:52,520
just one dot and yeah and then if you

00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,559
are not able to hear then you get that

00:58:52,520 --> 00:59:05,089
oh why am i doing okay

00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:08,180
we you all should take a look oh there

00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:10,849
is a something like the rant on you mean

00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:11,329
like run Thailand or Tokyo the doctor on

00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:15,490
time

00:59:11,329 --> 00:59:19,059
oh this because I sing away please

00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:19,059
address on this

00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:44,410
so you can see the coastline welcoming

00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:49,109
but and then you see you're not going

00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:55,089
there and then you need to select then

00:59:49,109 --> 01:00:35,800
it gets computing you have fun on a

00:59:55,089 --> 01:00:37,810
contract that you hire a very nice

01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:54,700
simple and finish need to see a more

01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:57,490
computer and then you oh my I use Cuba

01:00:54,700 --> 01:01:07,780
stream because this is second one what

01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:11,040
no tip key oh okay so generally you are

01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,040
talking on the run time

01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:40,159
I tell you me need a location will use

01:01:24,489 --> 01:01:43,880
unstable all the time okay no rocket you

01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:46,640
mean you can use a stable and like

01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:55,630
nobody stopping you from using a lot of

01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:55,630
people go getting there no I think no

01:01:55,959 --> 01:02:07,459
all wish you the same

01:01:58,659 --> 01:02:13,719
oh because I was already here not

01:02:07,459 --> 01:02:23,809
actually our neighbor which was smooth I

01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:25,909
also know this only need these features

01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:30,619
you need a special feature species on

01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:37,189
there if you don't want you can use this

01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:48,709
one the only one that they're being

01:02:37,189 --> 01:02:53,259
inside the wayside like the Python plot

01:02:48,709 --> 01:02:53,259
in here to use you know something else

01:02:57,579 --> 01:03:04,630
very magical

01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:15,680
right I believe batteries included this

01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:43,640
one well and I know this I know this I

01:03:15,680 --> 01:04:04,820
have less magic no at least not does a

01:03:43,640 --> 01:04:06,830
lot magic oh yes yeah you know the

01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:09,890
runner it just to let you use anything a

01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:12,380
weight on the outer layer to make it

01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:14,210
back because the outer layer is not the

01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:16,130
doesn't support anything away so defined

01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:21,020
just to make it easier facilitate the

01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:25,580
process yeah no no design no you just

01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:37,630
wrap around this if you wanna see DSL

01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:37,630
you can see like the HTML quick Hey

01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:55,349
otherwise it'll be okay and then shaking

01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:55,349
I could adjust that so Mickey faster

01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:14,650
okay so next are we talking about strap

01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:17,220
another impediment ring trap so shot is

01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:21,970
a global data so there's a structure

01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:24,070
it's very similar to see right okay

01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:26,109
there's three thought one strap first

01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:29,140
you know there's the basic truck to push

01:05:26,109 --> 01:05:31,869
truck and you need a trap without show

01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:34,990
examples the base is like basic shot we

01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:37,500
open the infield and I gather it's very

01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:47,040
similar to the shot you see in C and

01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:55,420
torpasta is a to prefer to to happen but

01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:57,609
the fuchsia or the Apple okay sorry you

01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,859
know I mean I mean the few I mean a few

01:05:57,609 --> 01:06:03,420
does their name

01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:06,460
yeah I mean I mean a few determining and

01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:08,920
and and they behave like suppose you

01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:25,089
can't even access data like how excit

01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:28,420
turned up it can be different yeah you

01:06:25,089 --> 01:06:30,819
is just according to all the salt like

01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:34,480
what you put in here you need a truck

01:06:30,819 --> 01:06:36,400
the next one is this you very very very

01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:40,510
rare disease it is similar to the human

01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:43,540
type mainly it is used to like stories

01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:45,910
so you have a trait and that doesn't

01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:47,579
have any data so you're the creator

01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:50,760
trade but you need something to

01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:54,760
something to hold on

01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:56,890
then you need do then only you to you

01:06:54,760 --> 01:07:02,109
need lecture I won't be covering this a

01:06:56,890 --> 01:07:05,740
lot here so defining after miss a shot

01:07:02,109 --> 01:07:10,000
okay this example will be later so maybe

01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:13,390
your mother see now no so we have a

01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:16,869
structure a book contains the name view

01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:24,520
how many times is it view and tour is it

01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:27,820
or unavailable you can solve the fredita

01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:29,800
inside just just one day well of course

01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:34,570
you cannot nestle your pasta

01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:36,940
later I'll discuss only now and topo in

01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:39,550
favor buddy just came over in the

01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:42,580
example like be a start with P and I

01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:49,630
think all body it is the fight that call

01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:52,240
for a good one Kri Kri and some way a

01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:57,190
little I don't know the number so I

01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:59,410
bring the mic with a number and you need

01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:03,010
I shop okay I cannot think of anything I

01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:05,650
just pulled beep so bit it doesn't

01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:08,470
convey anything okay I just repeat so

01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:13,690
initialize how to initialize a basic

01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:16,359
frappe we just put eat ID with your

01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:22,029
specific field and just special ready

01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:26,710
this okay yeah then shorthand we are

01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:30,520
social dance in test so you initially if

01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:32,650
you have the same name as the few name

01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:41,469
you can just put there so you

01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:42,549
automatically use the same name oh you

01:08:41,469 --> 01:08:45,540
don't you don't have to choose with that

01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:45,540
you can see

01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,880
yeah these are all determined on either

01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:09,700
grantees issue this is a few meters and

01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:12,940
up on top yeah

01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:14,650
couple water Otto matters so they're

01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,580
just a random side I don't know why

01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:18,910
exactly

01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:24,850
so I just put for the 50s 25 50 is it is

01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:27,280
it good is it bad no no I Raji be you

01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:28,570
know a brother Rajiv energy be yeah I'm

01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,110
sorry something interesting argue is

01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:55,480
very boring

01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:58,840
a DVID nothing and then using a strap

01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:02,050
how to use make sure this is his living

01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:05,130
dot notation you just got the CUNY is

01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:07,810
racing for this teach you the post truck

01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:12,460
right couple how access the spot the

01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:14,170
number you need extra you I don't think

01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:18,840
you can use it but I just put people and

01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:21,160
on once I on so it's very basic right I

01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:28,540
read it from well before we are on

01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:33,610
anything just take a look and who save

01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:35,940
you compel you come on we see Jose one

01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,940
couple

01:10:38,559 --> 01:10:52,929
what are you adding we come up with a

01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:57,070
workable who's he winking oh okay so oh

01:10:52,929 --> 01:11:04,909
okay well okay one for power of us yeah

01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:13,030
yeah correct yes yes so you need the a

01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:13,030
oh this wrong with all let me modify

01:11:34,209 --> 01:11:40,489
because it's a lifetime there's two STR

01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:43,820
and the STR that doesn't know how how

01:11:40,489 --> 01:11:53,019
long that it exists how long is the last

01:11:43,820 --> 01:12:06,459
time for the string let's uh yes yeah

01:11:53,019 --> 01:12:06,459
okay thank you thank you Colleen Christy

01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:23,120
yeah it should be this is a reference

01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:25,489
and then why you need it is because it

01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:28,580
may the compiler doesn't know where the

01:12:25,489 --> 01:12:31,370
fish lifestyle you need how long each

01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:34,310
view and this for so here you specify

01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:39,610
that all of them have the same lifetime

01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:44,199
here so this is this can be useful cuts

01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:48,080
generic syntax and as well as lifetimes

01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:51,590
last time is that NASA is a contact me

01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:55,070
right away how long they were very

01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:59,739
beliefs like every everything have a

01:12:55,070 --> 01:13:13,940
life like human bond okay sure this user

01:12:59,739 --> 01:13:19,610
this user yes anything keep our people

01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:20,750
but people try to make a shot no no

01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:26,449
setting is different setting is a

01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:28,100
different lifetime except you can be

01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:30,469
stopping but it won't be sitting across

01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:33,920
Taipei is for like this on the entirety

01:13:30,469 --> 01:13:35,960
of the program recycle so this one is

01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,960
you just specify that the both of them

01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:45,260
same lifetime so when when the structure

01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:47,929
yet top yes

01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:52,370
this one this one must be there this one

01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:54,890
you can put it can be any how long can

01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:58,280
the two characters but people usually

01:13:54,890 --> 01:14:02,530
put these ABC some people don't because

01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:06,770
they know it's caca man you see ser

01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:10,600
right in a so library you see single

01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:10,600
quote ser singing

01:14:11,059 --> 01:14:15,900
no if you don't close them cool then

01:14:13,619 --> 01:14:22,730
there's a lot is a lot of time there was

01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:22,730
a time but pipe but this generic sorry

01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:30,480
right like this okay if in this case

01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:34,619
right generic you need to put here P and

01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:37,980
then comma the name can change due to T

01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:43,289
this is the generation so this means

01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:50,210
that the structure this is will wrap the

01:14:43,289 --> 01:14:50,210
pad there anything

01:15:00,949 --> 01:15:05,730
it's cogent so you see the code

01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:09,599
generation

01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:11,639
so this help you to generate and so this

01:15:09,599 --> 01:15:14,219
help you to implement code to implement

01:15:11,639 --> 01:15:16,769
back for you so we're going to generate

01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:18,300
yourself it's very important to generate

01:15:16,769 --> 01:15:21,269
every you need to attach a whole lot of

01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:24,690
code to you try to implement debug for

01:15:21,269 --> 01:15:27,239
data in the event of a in fact how you

01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:30,679
want to display River and so this one

01:15:27,239 --> 01:15:38,789
just pull ad then you increment debug

01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:41,510
the body so that your let let yeah let

01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:45,389
you display the Department are here and

01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:48,900
the this yeah is to make it to a string

01:15:45,389 --> 01:15:50,820
too late despair something Eddie if you

01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:53,329
do in a take you know because you cannot

01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:53,329
display data

01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:11,500
yes so for inner energy that right

01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:14,590
they also need to implement about all of

01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:17,320
them yeah if one does implement then the

01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:19,360
compiler tell you that this one does

01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:30,429
implement Eva but this is based on how

01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:32,619
they implement is a no you know is

01:16:30,429 --> 01:16:34,510
already implemented liebe so they were

01:16:32,619 --> 01:16:38,260
just created how you did want to display

01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:40,630
this data for debug just for this not

01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:44,349
not for you know for this whole you want

01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:47,820
to clean this whole structure yeah

01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:47,820
if I can do anything

01:16:53,570 --> 01:17:00,130
yeah you know this one we left I

01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:11,900
appreciate you not me other languages

01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:22,990
okay another example fight by okay fight

01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:22,990
I mean if I thought you can find by yes

01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:28,760
but Russ will be different Rose way

01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:31,730
that's already received an is not your

01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:35,570
side other arab it's one of the feature

01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:39,500
of iris is for other day from a rush of

01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:43,700
this Algebra II data the attachments for

01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:47,090
some data so it had to repeat them call

01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:50,600
composer side they want the do one the

01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:53,660
juice up now they're upto option so this

01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:57,560
is a simple example on let's say you

01:17:53,660 --> 01:18:01,600
have an option you want something is

01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:10,940
either yes

01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:13,520
it's either a number or nothing yeah but

01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:14,120
you need something like Union and unum

01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:24,760
together

01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:24,760
the Racine amis but this zero cost

01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:34,700
no no the cause I mean the type itself

01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:36,860
the the type of shop doesn't cost

01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:40,790
anything but offer data itself contain

01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:45,350
data so you will call something see

01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:48,530
Russell Union but the Union is unsafe

01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:52,540
because is just to let other people use

01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:56,710
the CF CF fi for fo fo for a pepperoni

01:18:52,540 --> 01:19:00,550
mini and Mini for I prefer but if and

01:18:56,710 --> 01:19:03,039
that's why there are these this is in

01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:06,760
the export book

01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:10,630
you see this Carpentier at school to

01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:13,630
replace now we just say it may be

01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:19,900
something married or nothing yeah okay

01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:20,980
better example okay so paying by this

01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:24,400
where you sir

01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:25,750
so we need to do it more okay so if I

01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:28,769
tell you can fight die

01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:38,949
now you can raise carry something string

01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:41,050
something chair week ahead okay okay can

01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:43,750
raise your head are you racing your that

01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:48,639
then so they were the other the other

01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:49,030
open FBI get get wanted you can't open

01:19:48,639 --> 01:20:03,849
it

01:19:49,030 --> 01:20:06,699
oh no cure these different yeah yeah and

01:20:03,849 --> 01:20:10,989
then you can run yeah you run by this

01:20:06,699 --> 01:20:12,909
about toilets or but not so doing about

01:20:10,989 --> 01:20:20,769
you can you get you can pro I just say

01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:21,429
huh yeah better than dying so okay we're

01:20:20,769 --> 01:20:23,920
ready

01:20:21,429 --> 01:20:26,320
they tell you go straight make sure

01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,719
thing you know how I feel we just put

01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:31,659
double colon 2x ready you can you can

01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:34,119
also import this you can you can put

01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:35,949
this into Scott reading the use no use

01:20:34,119 --> 01:20:37,510
statement grass you can put this into

01:20:35,949 --> 01:20:40,780
scope so you don't need to fight the

01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:43,150
colon colon run no concurrent fight so

01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:45,190
you can just use it already but if you

01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:50,650
have this although scope you can get it

01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:53,429
using this different time because both

01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:57,670
strap and in al is a custom Pat in rust

01:20:53,429 --> 01:21:01,000
so you can implement them you get I'm PL

01:20:57,670 --> 01:21:04,659
or that type so we can do custom

01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,610
function for the time let's say you want

01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:09,699
a function for the book right back to

01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:13,539
the book example there's a function call

01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:15,489
rate so you can read a book and the view

01:21:13,539 --> 01:21:16,140
count increase by one so you really want

01:21:15,489 --> 01:21:18,630
to have

01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:21,540
and then I'll tell you rate okay this is

01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:25,080
kind of pretty red book and you abracada

01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:27,840
bah dad if you just were so good with it

01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:37,500
you read a book like there's some Sun

01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:39,660
come well yeah so this is first okay

01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:40,440
help if you tear the book you do little

01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:44,370
return anything

01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:45,570
the book is hot huh but you can still

01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:48,600
rate in this case you can still read

01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:51,450
because the we story like this we don't

01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:54,360
check here what people do sometimes they

01:21:51,450 --> 01:22:00,950
can make use of rasa they can make this

01:21:54,360 --> 01:22:04,230
cut into another type yes they call drop

01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:08,460
so you implement drop drop is a trait

01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:10,950
you implement drop for at that type then

01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:11,460
it dropped when the tide goes out of

01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:17,160
scope

01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:19,650
then you shall feel you run you can do

01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:27,090
you can review them okay I really should

01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:31,760
see the core got a nice right the dock

01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:31,760
is very thin but basically no collab

01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:38,250
this is a drop quote and if you see the

01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:40,410
source code it's just I did the video no

01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:42,780
quick yeah yes

01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:46,580
it's just because you see it pic deep

01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:51,810
into scope and then it goes out of scope

01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:53,850
so this is not not really a magic so it

01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:57,960
just Falls application post available to

01:22:53,850 --> 01:23:01,280
go off last time okay like what I'm

01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:04,110
doing there burn and let's take this

01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:09,350
just take the book and burn it then the

01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:09,350
boys God you cannot use it anymore so

01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:22,460
okay if anything besides mutable borrow

01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:24,620
usable borrow or people call it people

01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:27,520
don't quite for advance before they

01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:32,620
didn't call me to borrow their quote

01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:32,620
what didn't quite unique something

01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:41,930
anyway key usually they do this and you

01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:44,330
will see mutable data necessary wins

01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:46,910
hundred percent is mutable sometimes it

01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:49,040
can be a different thing very small

01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:51,500
changes but made mutable is the easiest

01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,340
way to listing this to that so they put

01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:55,040
mutable there

01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:59,360
of course most of the little mule is

01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:02,690
visible then okay you see example so

01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:07,060
first we create a book then you read the

01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:10,160
book your printable owl you tell about

01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:12,110
your print well so I put it you just do

01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:15,260
not let the bat pick the book into scope

01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:23,810
if not the book we would die here then

01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:37,780
your burnable now if you burned in

01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:37,780
laughing space then maybe I can show you

01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:52,090
I propose II mentioned this one

01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:52,090
so let's say what if I put this

01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:07,520
somebody felt so good actually means no

01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:22,730
you can because you see the previous one

01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:26,270
if no you need to see based on this pack

01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:39,470
here yeah so is written here it is not

01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:46,520
written here I know but in kidding there

01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:48,800
are compiler will tell you because let's

01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:50,540
say okay just like you say people don't

01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:52,190
know right people just then if people

01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:57,050
put this code that's compatible with are

01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:59,780
you already on move here and valium up

01:25:57,050 --> 01:26:01,610
here and then valuable role here at the

01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:05,270
move so you want to borrow again in the

01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:07,960
upper your movie so the sort of rock

01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:11,690
Impala with it huh you cannot do this

01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:14,180
through around this like the last time

01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:30,850
for so this I don't need to worry the

01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:30,850
last restaurant I'll help you menu error

01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:43,260
so there they were just suggests you are

01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:45,780
disputable they were just consider

01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:46,140
changing this right commutable so allow

01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:48,000
it

01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:58,040
of course if Russ is rust from all the

01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:58,040
table I will change no no that's not

01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:07,440
usually it will be unless there are some

01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:09,840
cases where this help is a bit lengthy

01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:12,120
and you might get confusing is when you

01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:15,240
use the previous future and iterator

01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:18,840
when it is to when you get a long term

01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:20,940
the chunk of if you get a long tongue of

01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:23,250
the pipes hanging around that you will

01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:25,290
see multiple lines like explaining so

01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:26,790
long explaining the different type they

01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:30,420
merge together because everything will

01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:33,780
be but there is that hot yeah so far

01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:38,460
they haven't improve a bit but not a lot

01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:41,220
yeah didn't you see okay but now you

01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:46,310
know that the book is not so the main

01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:51,930
thing here is yourself it's not boring

01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:58,380
so the is picking itself so it's taking

01:27:51,930 --> 01:28:01,140
ownership of the book you usually go

01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:05,450
borrow okay let's say you have a book

01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:07,890
you want to read a book I borrow it away

01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:12,450
you want to take the book overall today

01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:19,740
but it's also but abroad I I bought you

01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:22,260
but you can tell me yeah yeah if you

01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:26,790
just want to borrow if you rather borrow

01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:29,490
and see it but you cannot no yes for

01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:33,060
people to understand we just say purpose

01:28:29,490 --> 01:28:35,690
of the MU is to make immutable but

01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,690
there's

01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:48,160
but new doesn't necessarily mean that it

01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:52,460
is 100% mutable it may means that like

01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:54,770
exclusively first year instead of

01:28:52,460 --> 01:29:32,570
thinking it s beautiful and immutable

01:28:54,770 --> 01:29:33,890
reference people get the idea okay if

01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:37,750
you notice there's four different

01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:42,190
combinations you can use here you have

01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:42,190
you have did

01:29:50,289 --> 01:29:56,690
your four-digit combination but in this

01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:58,610
case if you if you think this right

01:29:56,690 --> 01:30:00,739
you don't you don't be rotated so I

01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:04,699
don't if I'm rotating I will need to

01:30:00,739 --> 01:30:08,270
specify this so you understand like this

01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:12,349
for different combination the ampersand

01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:15,349
is for borrowing and new it's the

01:30:12,349 --> 01:30:24,500
suitable or not and ordered all their

01:30:15,349 --> 01:30:25,429
four different mindset here yes there

01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:28,520
was on a lifetime

01:30:25,429 --> 01:30:32,690
the mutilate mutable and different

01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:35,239
things you can read it there yes so in

01:30:32,690 --> 01:30:37,670
this case you take the book let's say I

01:30:35,239 --> 01:30:40,340
give you the ball but you cannot return

01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:42,050
it back to me so you just take the

01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:43,489
ownership or I can do anything with the

01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:47,260
book I can burn it

01:30:43,489 --> 01:31:00,320
yes put by your palm you're burning yeah

01:30:47,260 --> 01:31:05,000
soon the ball solid a special okay and

01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:08,449
the face VD interesting offer and yes

01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:10,570
better matching we are too many to one

01:31:08,449 --> 01:31:13,929
close up proper to measuring measure

01:31:10,570 --> 01:31:19,789
every flat brush it something like see

01:31:13,929 --> 01:31:22,369
okay beep leave anything up for you - is

01:31:19,789 --> 01:31:25,940
something like multiple switch statement

01:31:22,369 --> 01:31:27,530
and if that is just a finger one just be

01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:32,320
flat of course you can do else efnet

01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:36,670
but yes mirandaclare disobeyin

01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:40,969
just a pattern that we see in rust group

01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:43,429
is that let's say you want to return but

01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:44,510
you want to mesh the data here so if you

01:31:43,429 --> 01:31:46,250
measure if peiter

01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:48,559
go back to the fighter example if i to

01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:50,960
die then you just return

01:31:48,559 --> 01:31:53,869
story else that's why to die this return

01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:56,260
if anything just return this fighter to

01:31:53,869 --> 01:32:00,070
come back here

01:31:56,260 --> 01:32:09,610
oh if you couldn't give me the example

01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:24,100
we is we've you played me yes I do know

01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:32,140
I think I think it matters I'm an Eskimo

01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:33,700
always or nd if not because right now

01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:36,580
they are inside are see that's what

01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:39,460
absolutely they want to want to go for

01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:41,980
lightly if I like unlikely branch so

01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:44,620
they can specify likely like a macro

01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:47,820
here lightly and like me for discipline

01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:51,910
but right now is according to the order

01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:54,960
from while from my room

01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:58,060
yeah so did another example with if left

01:32:54,960 --> 01:33:02,170
so if I throw is like it let fight or

01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:04,870
die then we are just returned similar to

01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:09,460
this but this one you know wrong hey

01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:11,410
correct right let me color so this one

01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:20,680
will return not you are not written here

01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:22,800
if we turn off the function okay this

01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:26,440
one is me structuring that you know I

01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:27,850
put everything up or then yeah

01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:39,610
everything that I can think of your

01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:41,350
except the except the range except the

01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:43,960
range I didn't put here only the range

01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:47,110
you can just put that number number

01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:50,050
called double period period number

01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:51,489
that's for the number in the range there

01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:53,170
works for matching the integer you can

01:33:51,489 --> 01:33:55,870
rush for the range you can even match

01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:57,640
for a character can also range can also

01:33:55,870 --> 01:34:01,920
do ring on characters then let's say you

01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:05,489
wanted a tooth deck then just put a dot

01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:08,579
period in chrome thing yeah

01:34:05,489 --> 01:34:11,849
then fight oh no

01:34:08,579 --> 01:34:14,429
Piper can fight the Sprint this is two

01:34:11,849 --> 01:34:17,369
different option is either you match

01:34:14,429 --> 01:34:23,010
fighter type or by the racer so

01:34:17,369 --> 01:34:26,190
surrender pair so they're out so this

01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:30,510
myself why is let's say you want to race

01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:32,579
you want to race but you don't know what

01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:35,070
to race you you want to get the time

01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:37,619
right so you can just get the tire using

01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:41,099
these if you put aware about that you by

01:34:37,619 --> 01:34:42,179
deporting is variable and put it here if

01:34:41,099 --> 01:34:44,849
you don't to use it you just play the

01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:48,270
song now this mean

01:34:44,849 --> 01:34:54,480
yeah that's all except you're making

01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:56,130
into scope then left it provoked okay

01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:59,099
let's say you have four people by you

01:34:56,130 --> 01:35:03,389
throw it down with 30 so okay you also

01:34:59,099 --> 01:35:06,809
up then this one means that any other

01:35:03,389 --> 01:35:11,989
data that you don't care so they either

01:35:06,809 --> 01:35:11,989
score by device folder this structure

01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:23,880
yeah if you want you but I put

01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:25,710
everything here you can also put that

01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:29,040
it's going in fact here that they can

01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:32,159
find us what you think to mesh it some

01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:33,659
others yeah so this I'm Scott Walker but

01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:35,219
not you doesn't need to put that last

01:35:33,659 --> 01:35:38,280
one you can put underscore something

01:35:35,219 --> 01:35:39,090
goes okay so you need to measure

01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:43,790
everything if you don't measure

01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:46,050
everything they're a row and let's say

01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:49,349
this one if you just want to get a sound

01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:52,020
but you also met or only if you have

01:35:49,349 --> 01:35:54,090
heard a sound haha then or then a

01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:56,480
fighter you lock it up then you just be

01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:59,610
a fighter a fighter to knee little guy

01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:06,480
yeah so this is just in case you're the

01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:09,949
haha so next one this one this one we're

01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,949
on yeah

01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:30,980
I will show a green people setpoints

01:36:15,429 --> 01:36:33,080
content behind it we push a piece hey

01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:34,460
that's what you just think okay last

01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:40,550
night you just simple keep it simple

01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:42,560
just take the file it's electro cool we

01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:49,670
want to see that all experimental mice

01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:53,570
egg macros no it's a pinochle there's

01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:57,020
two macro to let you write one is when

01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:57,739
you are developing so one if you know it

01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:59,630
won't reach

01:36:57,739 --> 01:37:03,230
so it just pull reachable you can put a

01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:04,850
new campus on the inside to say what you

01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:06,560
can put a string inside to mention what

01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:07,969
is unreachable right here I just put

01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,480
them playing there we go through this

01:37:07,969 --> 01:37:14,900
whatever and sometimes when I do you

01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:17,570
think because Russ meets you to that

01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:19,550
handle all the cases let's say star path

01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:21,350
I have one implement yet what do you do

01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:23,659
there's no way you could put everything

01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:25,880
flows right so I do is I just put an

01:37:23,659 --> 01:37:28,070
implement but then everything after that

01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:31,820
you will read then you will just stop

01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:35,140
there so if helps in the unimplemented

01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:37,250
micro help a lot when developing stuff

01:37:35,140 --> 01:37:39,260
so instead of putting everything there

01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:41,989
at once you can just put an implementer

01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:43,000
through the top first then continue one

01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:45,650
by one

01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:51,260
yeah so additional reading we can read

01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:53,899
this question question

01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:56,889
I wrapped my promi book this very good

01:37:53,899 --> 01:38:00,349
book explains about this will quite

01:37:56,889 --> 01:38:03,679
Francesco know they improve it at some

01:38:00,349 --> 01:38:10,570
stuff harassed by example both of this

01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:10,570
belongs to a custom pack any question no

01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:32,329
because there are some parts let's say

01:38:30,349 --> 01:38:34,999
not just better matching it can be any

01:38:32,329 --> 01:38:37,550
way in your quote before Andrew berends

01:38:34,999 --> 01:38:39,139
remember let's say if you go and do some

01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:42,349
parts in Oakland you know that it won't

01:38:39,139 --> 01:38:45,039
reach I left there some arrow but you

01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:45,039
don't know why Farrow

01:38:49,419 --> 01:39:11,199
yeah but if you call thank you opening

01:39:00,729 --> 01:39:11,199
you panic panic panic panic yeah there's

01:39:12,369 --> 01:39:16,880
one the compiled of you stop all the

01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:18,789
errors people are so let's say some

01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:34,760
paths you're helping me develop yet and

01:39:18,789 --> 01:39:36,649
implemented but you can do something out

01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:38,209
there was okay now but in this case you

01:39:36,649 --> 01:39:41,619
know that you won't wish if you know

01:39:38,209 --> 01:39:41,619
that you will raise your perishable

01:39:43,119 --> 01:39:48,679
nobody nobody in some parts of the code

01:39:46,579 --> 01:39:52,249
right you know that they'll reach there

01:39:48,679 --> 01:39:54,619
but you require to do that part so you

01:39:52,249 --> 01:39:58,789
get you to write a part so you just put

01:39:54,619 --> 01:40:00,079
unreachable or let's say also when

01:39:58,789 --> 01:40:02,090
writing your quote you have a penny

01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:04,160
shred of quote you the function expect

01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:06,170
some types to be returned right

01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:08,300
but you have never finish I think

01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:11,750
actually we've done part so what do you

01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:15,700
do and implement that you just put so my

01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:15,700
advice yeah lightly budget problem

01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:26,170
no yeah like yes I mean we made also

01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:26,170
Leia die

01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:33,830
yes but Alicia bow let other people make

01:40:30,470 --> 01:40:51,320
it's making and more understandable that

01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:53,330
people know that is unreachable with you

01:40:51,320 --> 01:41:00,770
if you get that then you get run

01:40:53,330 --> 01:41:02,840
hospital yeah but if you know why Sarah

01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:06,100
and you know is fatal and where can I be

01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:19,330
your coward you will just put the penny

01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:21,410
yeah like oh don't know eligible is in

01:41:19,330 --> 01:41:24,470
unreachable is also in relief

01:41:21,410 --> 01:41:26,840
unreachable and what are you trippin

01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:28,610
implemented is also in release the only

01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:33,170
be but what is prepare to it be but

01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:35,450
underscore like Assad Assad can be in

01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:39,740
release MV but if you want to be in

01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:41,180
every way you just put a stud excrement

01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:55,570
him up if you're I just wanted to be in

01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:55,570
D but people underscore basa yes

01:41:55,800 --> 01:42:02,680
or that one also he helps speed up the

01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:06,820
court sometimes it lets the compiler

01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:10,270
know that there's a bounds between the

01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:12,970
types so the compiler can just keep some

01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:17,950
power checks people use the deeper a

01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:25,720
somet sometimes for the power yeah the

01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:52,900
boundary King yes they were helping with

01:42:25,720 --> 01:43:03,010
the parching yeah nothing no yeah

01:42:52,900 --> 01:43:05,190
something okay les voix de you him 19

01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:05,190
come

01:43:29,929 --> 01:43:34,170
okay thank you either for it might be

01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:38,190
for to differ

01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:41,030
- my name is Ellen so I think what I

01:43:38,190 --> 01:43:47,040
will wants to hear what you want to hear

01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:49,890
yeah okay okay so he wants me to share

01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:54,510
what my experience in Raskin Asia which

01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:57,929
happened this year April it beating so

01:43:54,510 --> 01:44:01,440
the the conference actually held was

01:43:57,929 --> 01:44:04,050
having a hot day Allah so the the

01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:05,850
scholar participants then there's also a

01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:09,780
lot of workshops more importantly is

01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:12,540
really can see the China community in

01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:16,500
rust are the involvement and if you can

01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:21,449
go to result CeeCee just Google amino

01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:30,420
ethyle see see we can see the yeah this

01:44:21,449 --> 01:44:31,710
is the China commuted but possa so some

01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:36,390
of the names

01:44:31,710 --> 01:44:40,410
whoever active is my tongue yeah he he

01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:45,780
actually writes a lot and China mostly

01:44:40,410 --> 01:44:49,080
they used each other for to information

01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:53,870
so if you are lucky enough you will be

01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:59,370
able to join join join our chat group so

01:44:53,870 --> 01:45:03,750
they also have the the rest con Asia

01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:08,219
that we chat and also the other the

01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:10,440
other group which is actually more more

01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:15,270
more more technical talk sir

01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:19,170
so maybe maybe once in a month you one

01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:21,619
speaker will reach at top you will see

01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:24,199
this face is just slice and

01:45:21,619 --> 01:45:26,920
you know here in a voice and it's just

01:45:24,199 --> 01:45:32,780
living voice messages only off so uh

01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:45,110
there's a lot of things like this the

01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:51,949
the we check groups are yeah yeah you

01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:54,619
have to find yeah okay yeah but by those

01:45:51,949 --> 01:46:06,199
we check ones you will go to find him on

01:45:54,619 --> 01:46:07,010
the YouTube yeah configure is it's just

01:46:06,199 --> 01:46:14,090
normal

01:46:07,010 --> 01:46:16,550
everybody oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so I

01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:18,050
mean because the Raskin Asia is in the

01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:22,969
China map 18-wheeler

01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:25,040
so so I I not sure about the time one

01:46:22,969 --> 01:46:30,080
group that Sarah but I know recently the

01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:33,020
whole comes club if in Taiwan then

01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:35,989
there's a few China speaker who as she

01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:37,130
spoke a in the Raskin Asia when over to

01:46:35,989 --> 01:46:46,300
give some talk sir

01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:46,300
yeah anything interesting are very cool

01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:55,880
okay okay good

01:46:52,099 --> 01:46:59,239
I guess this thing called tid be the

01:46:55,880 --> 01:47:03,230
idea is that there is in China online so

01:46:59,239 --> 01:47:04,940
the database company so they okay if you

01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:08,420
wanna learn how to build distributed

01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:10,909
database there's that there is really a

01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:14,869
github or there's a really a foreign

01:47:10,909 --> 01:47:17,239
page to guide people how to you know set

01:47:14,869 --> 01:47:18,980
up the superior database now after you

01:47:17,239 --> 01:47:25,429
know all this right you may contribute

01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:29,570
to the the ecosystem then there's quite

01:47:25,429 --> 01:47:31,610
and this then this is Russia guy came

01:47:29,570 --> 01:47:35,530
over here so give thoughts on whereas

01:47:31,610 --> 01:47:38,110
India so he went through some of

01:47:35,530 --> 01:47:40,620
the rudimental ways of building a wet

01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:44,380
assembly now afterwards that's another

01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:46,870
improved version we should actually make

01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:51,330
things more easier and you also show us

01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:54,040
like he implemented well exemplify for

01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:57,460
for companies who want to do dental

01:47:54,040 --> 01:48:00,550
modeling or do two for this and it will

01:47:57,460 --> 01:48:03,130
be on the web browser so you know

01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:06,520
because it's all web browser is easily

01:48:03,130 --> 01:48:09,690
shed but that having the that is to

01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:14,920
install the particular program for that

01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:18,850
minute then there's also various

01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:21,940
blockchain talks are actually not not

01:48:18,850 --> 01:48:37,180
various our workshop we should teach on

01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:42,220
substrate then you can I think the Adi

01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:44,800
Adi Adi Ali Papa so I think you can go

01:48:42,220 --> 01:48:49,060

01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:20,050
the Intel SGX are some memory includes

01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:27,730
counting how we're portions who uses

01:49:20,050 --> 01:49:30,010

01:49:27,730 --> 01:49:34,870
beta also being covered but the a beta

01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:40,989
is the workshop is no not very

01:49:34,870 --> 01:49:43,829
Raz based but I mean you just introduce

01:49:40,989 --> 01:49:51,989
some good applications that can

01:49:43,829 --> 01:49:55,190
to do a bigger thing Oh Ali papa this

01:49:51,989 --> 01:50:01,199
one is very good speaker ah so he gave

01:49:55,190 --> 01:50:04,920

01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:10,409
to do for the notifications staff panel

01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:16,199

01:50:10,409 --> 01:50:20,909
also accounting so about any color so so

01:50:16,199 --> 01:50:25,199
you're able to do templating for some

01:50:20,909 --> 01:50:31,099
fashion icon fashion fashion items to

01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:31,099
render on the on the mobile applications

01:50:40,579 --> 01:50:50,659
this one might be suicide and I think

01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:56,159
