connects by using dependent yes so you

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,800
can see how Ross compared to other

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,920
languages so today we are doing a

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,899
comparison between Python and Russ so

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:46,320
I'll be doing Python and you'll be doing

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:53,840
that's the religion objective of the

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,840
script program is to go to this page

00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:25,740
page go through every name type then

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:32,729
code each individual from this table so

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:35,750
give you an idea the source of the

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:43,280
document looks like it looks like this

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:50,930
the important part is here so each each

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:54,890
Pokemon is the name

00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,290
the type and the number is here and when

00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:05,030
you go to each individual Pokemon and

00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:28,310
each each each subset of my puppy is

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:34,330
actually a well so we are going to

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:38,090
scrape the side and pin up come on

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:43,370
regard into this one lights to the

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:48,680
screen so I'll be doing the Python

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:52,520
module and then I can will be doing the

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:58,190
resolution so in the middle if you have

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,989
any questions just let us know and then

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,660
you be able to see that difference

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:27,670
between Python and Russ a little more

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:27,670
clearly because we try to be nice

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,460
why did not these are just reading stuff

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:10,290
I just I learned some package this year

00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:13,050
it has that good even so I got it I need

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,920
Cupid adjust and request for WebP

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:23,150
requesting to request the high level

00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:25,980
interface to web request and select team

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:33,140
and in the face like a selector to

00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:36,810
select HTML stop and then also stir and

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:41,490
suddenly ripe for cereal and trendy

00:04:36,810 --> 00:05:04,580
religion which will be played on okay so

00:04:41,490 --> 00:05:04,580
now I have you open up the top right I

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:12,360
need to add a show which other search

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,970
requires we should be right because

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,040
trendy evening edition assign people

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,930
introduced sir

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,660
the rival I did but then after that when

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,190
20 version edition all right so now they

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,410
just put it as a feature we don't need

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:37,280
an additional quick auditory so I just

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:37,280
do it in and now Gianni

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,589
[Music]

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:59,639
you do this which I definitely have a

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:06,840
competition I need to finish so this is

00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:07,190
comparable and once you put it then you

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,160
have you

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,160
I just

00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,360
[Music]

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,359
[Music]

00:08:49,750 --> 00:09:26,140
Oh God correct answers for each of the

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:31,170
division water I do a quest to the

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,170
individual Pokemon and trigonometry

00:09:42,690 --> 00:10:20,350
which is you I'm trying to keep this

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,570
simple so that you can come but because

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:39,310
the meaning that I will showcase is for

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:42,460
us sometimes we just represent it is

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:46,480
very useful right there's a rascal book

00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,660
which is something of an official right

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,660
now

00:10:57,220 --> 00:12:09,850
so there's no meaning extant when you

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,070
[Music]

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,459
so there are quite a number of things

00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:50,689
that you don't need to write any more

00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:53,279
internet video channels such as some

00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:56,639
things that you are particularly like

00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:01,439
the x10 here then they are also some of

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:06,379
the like title things that you might not

00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:06,379
see today also you don't need to declare

00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:21,439
in certain cases move my videos in Tunis

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,939
but just in case of all the cases yes

00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:27,509
yeah we are ready to do everything you

00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:29,430
don't need experts on pace to me not

00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:33,470
should not allow an innkeeper of the

00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,470
right later than my original

00:14:46,879 --> 00:15:26,999
nobody back attorney you can even use it

00:14:50,159 --> 00:15:32,399
like you can't even use it without a

00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:36,229
previous life which is what I'm doing

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,229
right now because I cannot remember

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:52,399
let's say your beta because request

00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:56,009
returns result where whether you if you

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,529
be successful or people so if I read is

00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:00,809
possibly say okay I just AM computed

00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:05,039
with you they should work if it doesn't

00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:07,259
the opening so pending trust me

00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,779
yeah that's too kind of our early career

00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:12,749
us the first kind is the favorable

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:15,319
recover errors the second line in pure

00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:15,319
terror

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:28,490
after the but it was mission you're sure

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,810
that you won't repeat expect if this

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,240
ever happens means that something is

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:35,890
really wrong some way and you will need

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,890
to care about this people how they spell

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,800
yes just pick that theta this is a

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:50,240
pressure map but then that what is

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:57,470
something you probably won't you and the

00:16:50,240 --> 00:17:05,810
code because about it we do a graph is

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:27,370
already you mean propagate the propagate

00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:30,650
error so if you do this when you use a

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,130
question mark the content itself has to

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,269
be

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,269
[Music]

00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:53,539
[Music]

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:56,059
let's say your piece this is almost an

00:17:53,539 --> 00:18:04,399
adult function that returns depends on

00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:07,789
the time here by the right here yeah the

00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:09,860
show let's say you're this internal data

00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:13,190
this is a result let's say device a

00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:16,190
result which can fill that is mesh

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:20,559
statement if it works then you return

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:27,020
data if it doesn't work then you return

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:30,260
you return the same error so this is

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:50,750
essentially what and with this we can

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:58,130
write this as I read crashing man it's

00:18:50,750 --> 00:19:03,429
not a macro is a you can recognize my

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,429
call very clearly when function function

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:35,040
which would drop the line without you

00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:37,040
don't go right again you can show me

00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Oh

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:40,890
[Music]

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,569
[Music]

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:43,739
[Music]

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:36,100
otherwise we'll be waiting for so now so

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:56,370
I need so something just take each thing

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:56,370
click the link no library

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,130
[Music]

00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,150
[Music]

00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,920
the

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,579
[Music]

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,460
not necessarily mostly because of the

00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,460
speaker

00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,119
[Music]

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,520
[Music]

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,839
[Music]

00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:43,760
yeah yeah they're using is what if you

00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:47,280
for you to try to from request URL so

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:54,570
then whether one is because what the one

00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:57,870
is you see request get if you wanna get

00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:02,610
right there was something like tree into

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:08,480
URL which into URL is what if you try

00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:14,600
into the things there except strength

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:19,470
but no three so because

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:23,220
and yeah is on the stack and string is

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:32,280
on keep Oh Minnie is this different but

00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:36,870
you can just use a string will do is you

00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:39,840
tear a mikvah like when you when you see

00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:49,790
this let's say you don't know how to get

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:49,790
at the arc on 3ds you see the string

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:58,890
just search for idea you see they say

00:28:53,930 --> 00:29:06,060
methods for letters from terror forget

00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:09,290
SPR so me that this this thing means

00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:22,560
that if you put up if you put a

00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:28,440
important in front so when you see this

00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:34,500
important image that if you homework

00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:37,320
that string as the idea so the coin the

00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:40,380
quality read something to get river

00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:58,290
sometimes you go to an adverse you got

00:29:40,380 --> 00:30:03,420
even getting let's say this is an

00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:05,550
erosion oh it's not just green it's

00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,590
actually used to your assignment you

00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:10,310
will you still clean up

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,310
yes

00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:38,409
okay wrong

00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:40,359
so nothing now what's all this right so

00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:42,329
we'll show you some Jews who are hung up

00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:48,459
with it

00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:50,949
so instead of getting so what debug will

00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:54,929
show you is you because you drew a name

00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:58,719
because to this so debug will show you

00:30:54,929 --> 00:31:00,339
that this dot X will be equal to this

00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:02,769
you can also make the shot nearby ocean

00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:04,869
value little you're some Arab avoid a

00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:06,599
tricky shot like over like that so you

00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:09,969
really have to choose do not know motion

00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:20,799
last time before the buffer we do is we

00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:24,489
just do like printing our end if you do

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:27,939
this then this this means that we can

00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:31,659
print the commercial people yes and

00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:34,679
heating sentiment that epub trade we

00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:37,509
should throw like the full version but

00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,819
you don't need is because the ink you

00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:42,999
might anticipate right there's to trade

00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:45,339
for displaying one is this or you can

00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:48,639
put these as well but is out of scope

00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:53,199
the edges are pretty pretty version of

00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:56,199
this so this one is I shot the Dom

00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:59,229
Persian depart rate and then this one

00:31:56,199 --> 00:32:02,259
will be the display trade we can use

00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:03,909
either but now device here so for

00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:08,499
debugging purposes I just use these will

00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:13,119
be faster then this one this version is

00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:15,609
like not non class anyway because a like

00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,099
nothing why do you want to do or you

00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:20,859
want to do string that's mutable and

00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:22,929
then you assign you a game so you don't

00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:25,289
you're gonna get whatever right well you

00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:25,289
can do it

00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,640
[Music]

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,370
so what what how this works I just get

00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:32,460
first thing yes here I guess you're the

00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:36,630
first one right sure there's just only

00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:41,130
one item there so you see that next we

00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:46,590
turn an option so I know that I need at

00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:49,500
least about that so option means that it

00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:54,210
can be or show me that we can be nothing

00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:57,150
or something so I read is to get

00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,870
somewhere you this is how Russia does

00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:02,420
now

00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,420
now I use the beginning of the mystic

00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,329
[Music]

00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,070
you

00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,019
[Music]

00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:41,479
[Music]

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,580
[Music]

00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:56,820
[Music]

00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,749
[Music]

00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,950
this is one

00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:25,420
[Music]

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,349
[Music]

00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,450
okay

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,099
[Music]

00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,889
[Music]

00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:15,360
[Music]

00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,010
[Music]

00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,679
[Music]

00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:19,650
trying to spend money explaining them

00:38:13,430 --> 00:39:30,330
one gentleman I do is for just one

00:38:19,650 --> 00:39:32,730
bugging I just know okay - yeah but okay

00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:37,460
expend not when I'm running I say my

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:46,230
DVDs so let's say come here buddy done

00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:47,730
then it was a hello but you need to

00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:57,690
explain it's okay

00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:59,870
okay is without night so okay and when

00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,870
it is

00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,280
[Music]

00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:54,470
[Music]

00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:58,760
none that have done some so if you are

00:40:54,470 --> 00:41:10,200
there can be all over you just use these

00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:15,900
every time you just put the know it must

00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:37,910
be one of them it can be some on man

00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:37,910
but it cannot be neither or it should be

00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:48,780
this is one of the reason is because in

00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:54,890
matching to tell you

00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,890
you saw that mesh right metric mesh data

00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:06,430
if I only put okay bunny extract

00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:08,769
metadata out preemie now but I just

00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,489
ignore the error I just put it like this

00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:21,459
right

00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:24,699
even a bunnies you try if you throw an

00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:27,279
error and tell you that this is normally

00:42:24,699 --> 00:42:31,119
because you need to match a really tight

00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:33,309
side or you can use to measure

00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,979
everything but this is one of the reason

00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:38,999
how we become let you know that whether

00:42:35,979 --> 00:42:41,650
you're covered or the possible issues

00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:43,359
like surpasses all you see is not bad

00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:47,529
but then how about other people take

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:54,539
edge cases for you and the adoption and

00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:58,269
you have result reduc is different in

00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:59,130
reg reg contains two areas okay and

00:42:58,269 --> 00:43:02,609
error

00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:08,890
okay can be different type from area I

00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:12,940
reckon this is activity during so you

00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:15,519
can contain normal type or you can

00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:18,809
contain some some kind of error it can

00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:21,849
be a string cause something like that

00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:23,559
yeah so this is to be done merrily you

00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:26,199
use this result to represent something

00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:31,959
that can fill and have some area code or

00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:35,259
some error some kind of error so and why

00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:38,589
we need like to shadow this the season

00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:39,699
that runs modified data going to I only

00:43:38,589 --> 00:43:42,619
this beta

00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:45,480
I just want to hunger

00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:47,910
if not if you want to do this without

00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,650
Chad when you do that something is right

00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:56,369
then so why not just like all or

00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:59,519
overactive is also the reason why he

00:43:56,369 --> 00:44:03,569
does shadowing here is because the first

00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:05,099
line the sine of theta is one type the

00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:07,920
next line is another time

00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:12,839
so when you do shadowing it can change

00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:16,519
it inaudible but you do shadowing when

00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:20,130
you shadow down all one you VI gone and

00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:23,250
you will be a new data library so that

00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:25,019
change as well but the only problem is

00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:50,009
that you need to put that keyword

00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:54,660
different right now why do I just pick

00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:57,210
it up no serialization done nothing

00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,910
special down here so okay now I'll

00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,230
explain how to improve this but it is

00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,519
pretty much understand right

00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:04,519
this one is to find

00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,469
[Music]

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:58,530
yeah just a purse when you're new

00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:12,270
it doesn't no no stop there probably

00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:16,080
because so if I can be written in this

00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:19,580
way it can be further we return into

00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,580
something that doesn't look like this

00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:33,080
okay nothing where you where you want to

00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:33,080
find some data and basically you

00:46:48,310 --> 00:47:02,750
okay so this one basically you create a

00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:06,710
type of vector vector is something like

00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:09,080
an array except that you see the array

00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:11,600
and we're telling us I really don't

00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,580
understand you need to define need apply

00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:17,810
the spice compound type at a couple time

00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:22,790
and for vector you need you can anxiety

00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:27,040
that many three so it needs to be moved

00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:27,040
over L if you're going to the WC IRS

00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:34,640
because you won you take is so you want

00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:36,320
to add something over that time if it's

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,320
not mutable gross prices in the double

00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:42,650
by default the done here - I just put

00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:46,550
every visible then you cannot draw the

00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:48,500
time this will be similar you see this

00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:50,050
pattern similarly how people do it right

00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:56,530
in Python

00:47:50,050 --> 00:48:16,370
let's say - E and then you say something

00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:18,230
like how I did like but people could do

00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:20,060
this in my tonight if they don't know if

00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:25,330
you'll notice this is similar to the

00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:25,330
wine rust if another way to do this is

00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:51,240
do this yeah but is not done this

00:48:44,240 --> 00:49:01,680
comprehension so hard so I think

00:48:51,240 --> 00:49:04,600
so Russ have something like collect : is

00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,660
hope when we want to actually evaluate

00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:10,690
the result yeah by default everything is

00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:17,050
just definition is very easy it's an

00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:21,280
easy religion so only when you connect

00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:24,270
is a function in so when you're more

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:27,660
that it can be tends to be about wisely

00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:32,730
then you can see this is from iterator

00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:35,590
so you see okay for meat order but you

00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:56,940
notice that I think John also colleague

00:49:35,590 --> 00:50:03,850
right yeah but this thing is because

00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:27,040
just connect into a vector connecting

00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:31,030
into a hashmap let me use the method for

00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,620
the iterator so you need to if you want

00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:37,870
the value you need to connect to

00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:40,480
evaluate the heck are you claiming the

00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:44,590
molecules connects the result for the

00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:47,580
quality so that case yeah but yeah it

00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:50,580
makes over the whole eater is expression

00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,580
so

00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:59,930
nobody's this is similar to what you

00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:03,170
need and what you declare what you

00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:07,550
expect from the collector so you can

00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:11,240
also expect a single value rather reduce

00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:14,900
also codecollaborator it through the

00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:17,330
whole iterator but quality they iterate

00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:20,270
through the whole iterator and give you

00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:23,090
one happy one so that they call it is

00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:29,690
very powerful you even thunk that not

00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:40,700
because he expects from iterator so from

00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:43,670
iterator can be a vector competitor that

00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:47,300
multiple I don't have implement this

00:51:43,670 --> 00:52:04,300
computer either so let's say you want it

00:51:47,300 --> 00:52:08,920
to be you can okay so what is that is

00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:11,540
you can collect this into a bank bill

00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,880
this is you know why I did buy your

00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,940
video time so because Russia Happy

00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:20,330
Prince so they didn't put that piece is

00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:26,180
the when you evaluate this this should

00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:37,340
be a texture that should be no we saw at

00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:39,500
the ball it's like no you cannot what

00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:42,920
will be the default yeah if you shrink

00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:45,580
or if you want to convert you cannot

00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,580
come back from here

00:52:52,950 --> 00:53:03,270
one two three four well you boys if you

00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:21,240
put it in put it equal to the type

00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:23,790
depending on the result it's not a

00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:27,120
present professor because my teapot is

00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:35,510
shrink so they are according to the

00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:40,290
default value if that's a number by the

00:53:35,510 --> 00:54:21,690
kernel definite is going to be even

00:53:40,290 --> 00:54:27,090
taught explicitly so what is it from

00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:30,540
what I know about the fight by

00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:37,190
definition explain how it captures the

00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:37,190
member for example so I need to write

00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:47,910
other than this you could do it other

00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:51,320
way then you can make it here you can

00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,320
you can make this year

00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:10,530
there was a call it's not the one like

00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:18,240
if you see something is wrong if it

00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:19,890
doesn't match it cannot fulfill so quite

00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:32,340
some question that's all you know but it

00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:46,980
is not always we can hear it I don't i

00:55:32,340 --> 00:56:00,570
top that this is the but you know

00:55:46,980 --> 00:56:05,390
because this means that this item that

00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:05,390
what what is here is if the collection

00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:22,260
so here that means that this code is

00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:25,110
item of these but this cause I have to

00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:27,420
write about string so when you wanna

00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:43,170
give you becomes straight itself so

00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:45,480
you're just calling it can be it can be

00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:48,360
connected into like the taxes Java can

00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:50,970
call you can call any two tuples or you

00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:53,610
can connect into array or so sometimes

00:56:50,970 --> 00:57:00,250
you can eat other stuff not just like

00:56:53,610 --> 00:57:11,530
so later general general method this is

00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:14,050
how to improve it now what next

00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:14,560
what can you do i what were they who

00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:17,530
next

00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:20,260
so I don't do that why do is it I can

00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:31,360
just keep just stick to where you're

00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:58,720
famous giving tonight there's no more to

00:57:31,360 --> 00:58:02,460
the way I can take involving just now

00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,460
you say that there's pool that's right

00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:16,630
no yeah but it sounds like so

00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:20,520
haha I am sure the one anywhere okay the

00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:20,520
cocktail because I need you just

00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:24,530
so there's a JSON macro avoided by the

00:59:22,410 --> 01:00:13,680
macro crate so you can just write ups

00:59:24,530 --> 01:00:16,700
something like micro here but let me

01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:21,630
show you I notice I make sure if this

01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:25,349
this thing right it you this macro that

01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:27,540
will keep the position like this macro

01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:30,900
provided by the third person such as if

01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:33,810
I are very very nicely relation is real

01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,950
everyone this is to just create a choice

01:00:33,810 --> 01:01:46,980
value

01:00:34,950 --> 01:01:50,849
and while we are going to improve okay

01:01:46,980 --> 01:02:01,170
so now find a structure here and I give

01:01:50,849 --> 01:02:04,890
it a serious what it does here is a way

01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:08,700
does here is that if you still need

01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:09,240
their weight Amanda Stewart I see you

01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:12,690
later

01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:16,829
for these their creator implementation

01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:19,849
polls you Eliza for the structure so

01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:23,160
essentially there will this is a

01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:26,089
conversion conversion thing where they

01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,089
have

01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:52,990
then they do a bunch of stuff here okay

01:02:49,110 --> 01:03:10,300
so now based on output how do you want

01:02:52,990 --> 01:03:14,260
to make this into a rest type so so you

01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:23,770
just know it's not pretty but it'll be

01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:37,300
fine yeah yeah and if I mean our us

01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:41,470
people don't because yes this means this

01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:43,600
means that something I did oh so that's

01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:45,220
actually I believe you put it in if the

01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:48,670
variable name is the same and a

01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:51,330
tightness is stable so what do you think

01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:59,790
I will just see realize this Pokemon

01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:59,790
into a stratum so I'll just do okay one

01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:48,910
you can borrow here because expect them

01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:53,950
to be borrow is a concept I also now

01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:58,840
this especially Pokemon what he does

01:04:53,950 --> 01:05:04,480
here is this one you create a zero see

01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:15,220
realized implementation to show Pokemon

01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:18,250
that can be sterilized into serializable

01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:20,730
trade this tool trade is a big computer

01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:25,560
there's cereal aisle in see realized

01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:25,560
one is a datatype and why is the doctor

01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:35,910
soompi right create a plan for from

01:05:30,109 --> 01:05:42,599
legacy alliance yeah so is your life but

01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:44,579
I'm not using this is it if you realize

01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:47,250
about me I'm not using it yeah

01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:49,619
Missy realizes like when you have a

01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:54,059
string that you want to convert that

01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:57,240
string back to rust structure then you

01:05:54,059 --> 01:06:00,049
can use this you realize and it's your

01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:05,670
lightly spread retractor you want to

01:06:00,049 --> 01:06:13,829
simulate it into Selassie into a spring

01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:21,510
or you can use a new direction

01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:23,400
right but what this nothing you must

01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:26,670
realize your us is that you don't you

01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,829
can just see you guys to see be well by

01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:31,380
just changing this even the change to

01:06:28,829 --> 01:06:39,200
see we also when you add see we are free

01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:52,770
and just use this somebody right away

01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:56,700
common binary yeah

01:06:52,770 --> 01:07:00,839
yes to a few things so right now what is

01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:04,950
not possible a few bit of event no no

01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:06,630
but above all cattle photo here so most

01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:15,539
of these right they have this similar

01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:18,079
API or same API you can say yes is a

01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:18,079
possible suspect

01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:04,130
just asking

01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:20,670
yeah what was that Weiss Weiss nothing

01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:23,819
yeah yeah

01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:25,410
nothing okay our spin has he just not

01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:27,210
only meet up the text bar thing okay

01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:30,259
like just now all I see people or you

01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:33,000
like the one the point do you write zero

01:09:30,259 --> 01:09:36,719
okay so it's not just a meter the text

01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,810
passing it can be a binary file passing

01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:42,150
like zebra or you can pass programming

01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:48,770
language which most programming language

01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:48,770
they'll have they'll have what Alexa and

01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:57,060
tokenizer and panting helpers are

01:09:52,290 --> 01:10:01,230
somewhere in DT so you can also pass

01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:12,000
like Neville protocol right in the

01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:16,680
charge so you can also pass like let's

01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:19,469
say peek at you know I speak at you can

01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:22,710
also pass pcap or RC formats you can

01:10:19,469 --> 01:10:25,350
also pass like all the text is not a

01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:29,370
dimension or anything they today

01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:33,270
structured you can pass if you have a

01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:36,120
structure on how the data works so today

01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:38,460
I will be explaining like how how you do

01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:41,760
consume rough and what kind of the

01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:48,330
different passing style that you will

01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:50,840
see that commonly hear us how expression

01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:50,840
works

01:10:55,949 --> 01:11:06,250
so I'll just do it between showing

01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:09,550
something simple without like like main

01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:10,739
expedition here so okay first start

01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:13,510
packing hello

01:11:10,739 --> 01:11:16,900
you know just write a passing from

01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:19,690
scratch so you write a manual passer you

01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:22,060
you'll be coming at this on you will not

01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:23,830
be sorry IDs this is one of the pipe

01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:26,080
because these hand roll so you can write

01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:28,900
it however you want so you see all kinds

01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:32,050
of stuff like from a so that your serie

01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:38,969
a today you'll see any any different

01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:42,250
kind of stuff how passing the world so

01:11:38,969 --> 01:11:47,920
this in this passing example there will

01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:52,360
the liberation like rust passing let's

01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:54,940
say they do the master input it's common

01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:58,540
that you're in passing right your he'll

01:11:54,940 --> 01:12:03,820
be common to see people using like array

01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:07,630
this is array in brass like a unsigned

01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:10,090
integer there so the party invites

01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:13,270
whatever the string you can you also see

01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:15,340
that some people passing in string so

01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:18,969
what if that is you have four tokens and

01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:22,690
you keep looping in the token so your

01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:24,429
your mesh the others so you measure

01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:25,650
first few items and then you get I

01:12:24,429 --> 01:12:32,020
others here

01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:34,210
and and then you you get the you mesh

01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:39,060
like what why is passed you twice passed

01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:43,929
in a if not you just handle errors so

01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:47,320
how I handle passing works right it can

01:12:43,929 --> 01:12:50,199
be you can have full control and it can

01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:52,660
be very very optimized is very fast or

01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:57,969
very slow depends on how you write it

01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:59,830
so for example you can see I so Jason

01:12:57,969 --> 01:13:01,980
it's also hang roll like SMB traders

01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:08,580
that way faster than producers like that

01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:10,739
people that use it but one one thing you

01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:13,140
know to note that if you do magnify

01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:14,430
saying you can be tedious and I was like

01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:17,160
you need to reinvent the view that

01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:19,050
everybody do sometimes you just don't

01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:23,580
want to do like made up a saying what

01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:25,620
can you do now like manual passing or

01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:29,430
high roll padding is like on the extreme

01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:34,620
side to do stuff merrily where and then

01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:36,660
on the extreme side okay okay and then

01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:39,300
you can do something so cool but you'd

01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:42,540
want or the Bastile code then you have

01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:46,050
tracked passing expression grammar so

01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:47,670
you just write each one's and then okay

01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:48,690
this will be this is some something you

01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:50,810
look this should look something like

01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:53,730
this

01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:58,380
I've taken this from past a library

01:13:53,730 --> 01:14:00,330
called compare so you write something to

01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:03,810
differ and compared to writing

01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:05,190
everything hand roll something something

01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:07,470
like this you can define that like

01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:09,630
something a pseudo code where

01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:12,720
domain-specific language so this is a

01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:17,630
seam something's minimo I took from a

01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:20,730
path for passing jason using using these

01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:24,480
so some some functions you will see it

01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:26,760
how this works is that they're also the

01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,090
structure of passer and they take the

01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,500
grammar

01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:34,830
I just how you the father you see is

01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:38,250
jason that path and then you will pass

01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:42,440
and sample sure here shows up functions

01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:44,489
how you pass that how you pass value so

01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:46,410
sometimes it will be IDs you just

01:14:44,489 --> 01:14:48,080
iterate through all the tokens that

01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:51,770
means pass

01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:58,460
and just use it somebody's that you

01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:59,390
write a lot less rascal but but your

01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:03,100
student is right on time especially

01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:07,460
English we should need to learn as well

01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:09,170
what about this ok you can see that it's

01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:13,310
very very expressive and very beautiful

01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:15,320
but sometimes is hard configured it's a

01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:18,020
waste lower than the lady part like

01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:19,640
maybe I'll explain about Islam and he'll

01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:25,640
be a lot to avoid an original version

01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:28,870
and miss one using this style passing it

01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:32,290
so hot very hard to optimize for speed

01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:35,420
ok next

01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:39,620
so first I talk about when you're

01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:42,260
passing henro passer and then I talk

01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:44,000
about like using something very

01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:45,650
expressive you just write the language

01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,780
and then they will automatically pass

01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:50,420
that into the stuff that you want and

01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:52,720
then you can just use all the passing

01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:56,450
deposit stop

01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:58,550
next is parcel commoner let us see

01:15:56,450 --> 01:16:02,030
something and finally very big

01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:06,080
especially communities come in what what

01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:24,110
guys come in the trees and it was wife

01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:28,160
oh ok ok

01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:32,690
so you see fun so you see fan 13 high

01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:35,910
school ID a lot as I remember

01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:39,750
okay the sole basis so basically what

01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:46,170
they do is they just combine function to

01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:47,580
pass rosco know to pass code pasa yeah

01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:51,540
basically they just combining functions

01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:56,120
to possible to achieve stuff so

01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:59,610
different types of passing the the si

01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:01,620
there's a trade based function based and

01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:02,160
microwave there's one mobile for Oh

01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:05,220
why's that

01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:07,920
the make the most made most used method

01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:12,180
to pass is using function based and

01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:15,510
macro base one this is the most famous

01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:18,410
library currently they use okay there

01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:21,240
are why I put here is because this

01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:26,790
technique we just call eating / pipe I

01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:30,510
know and macro base is they just write a

01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:34,860
bunch of macros and you just use those

01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:38,010
across and it can be similar to DSL it's

01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:42,320
very powerful and fast reverse tsunami

01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:45,060
time almost almost as fast as the native

01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:48,780
henro pasta that you can roll I said

01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:52,140
it's a big bits of organized and you

01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:53,970
have like where is people named Steve

01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:55,740
the niccola at first when you look when

01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:58,830
you get into power combinators but later

01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:01,890
on you'll be easier and also you'll be

01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:07,500
harder to debug because it using macros

01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:09,180
so an example is here this is based on

01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:14,010
that example you can see in Nome the

01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:15,780
library and this library the the inside

01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:16,230
your main found they're showing example

01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:19,020
called

01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:22,790
yeah using across you see that the name

01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:25,129
and to pass this is to pass a hex code

01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:28,249
her color code

01:18:25,129 --> 01:18:30,609
then you will see that the project has

01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:33,409
something I did

01:18:30,609 --> 01:18:36,189
I'm missing something about then this is

01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:42,439
either general idea how they pass stuff

01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:45,979
okay so next function base like I'm not

01:18:42,439 --> 01:18:49,699
sure why but mom is switching towards

01:18:45,979 --> 01:18:51,530
function based approach in non pipe they

01:18:49,699 --> 01:18:54,530
are still developing a long pipe and

01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:56,689
there's a sub Tom not so not so famous

01:18:54,530 --> 01:19:00,289
there's also combined with a lot of

01:18:56,689 --> 01:19:03,729
other I just implemented using function

01:19:00,289 --> 01:19:08,179
based so normal I have no comment

01:19:03,729 --> 01:19:11,929
Justin is not out yet okay so this is

01:19:08,179 --> 01:19:14,919
something like how non pipe look like so

01:19:11,929 --> 01:19:19,039
why does is let's say this is a Jason

01:19:14,919 --> 01:19:22,999
passing function what it does is that is

01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:25,760
to use this some macros right now but

01:19:22,999 --> 01:19:28,489
the main the main passing will be be a

01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:31,789
function may be something like this

01:19:28,489 --> 01:19:34,629
where you just design is to identify the

01:19:31,789 --> 01:19:34,629
radio for the posse

01:19:34,959 --> 01:19:43,999
okay so numb don't fight just now

01:19:38,289 --> 01:19:47,749
there's combined combined is yet and the

01:19:43,999 --> 01:19:49,789
departing library you can say is it

01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:52,309
based on the height that's what they say

01:19:49,789 --> 01:19:59,409
that follows up compared to macro based

01:19:52,309 --> 01:20:03,709
library and but is slower than known and

01:19:59,409 --> 01:20:08,570
this is one of the example for passing

01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:10,689
in combine you will see that there they

01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:13,929
put a lot of these functions and then

01:20:10,689 --> 01:20:21,469
they're coming at least this is to pass

01:20:13,929 --> 01:20:23,780
P over an example to pass a property in

01:20:21,469 --> 01:20:28,579
UML so you can see that they combine

01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:33,939
this function and this token so you can

01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:33,939
get the stuff up using just functions

01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:38,670
yeah and then now it's the reference

01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:42,659
this the students are useful you can see

01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:46,050
the first one is the first one will be

01:20:42,659 --> 01:20:49,139
the there sure like a tutorial step by

01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:51,090
step guide on how to write my own path

01:20:49,139 --> 01:20:53,639
of combinatorics is that your hello

01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:59,070
world to other Combinator's how you

01:20:53,639 --> 01:21:01,590
combine the function and how how how

01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:05,190
particle by networks was is that they

01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:08,460
just show from nothing the sum function

01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:12,510
the past and then combine functions

01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:14,100
together and at the end there are some

01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:17,330
outputs there passed something passed

01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:20,130
XML simple XML the second one is that do

01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:22,590
basic presentation but in this

01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:25,830
presentation there show the comparison

01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:27,420
between different between non combined

01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:29,639
and passed

01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:32,670
I just now why I discussed as well

01:21:29,639 --> 01:21:35,239
purses the ones they show for the path

01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:38,130
this one is passed

01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:39,360
so this the percentage we hope was

01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:41,820
thickening in just showing the

01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:45,150
combination they also saw some short on

01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:52,290
benchmarks for the same same thing that

01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:54,840
they want to pass any question we are

01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:58,230
going to I think it should any I need to

01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:01,369
show the examples on how parcel how the

01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:01,369
community looks like

01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:18,990
or you can see okay

01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:24,720
visually babe besides I actually wrote

01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:29,250
from the the link - oh oh I just show

01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:34,560
the original to Korea because I made me

01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:37,580
be okay maybe I discuss all this contact

01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,580
appeal issue space

01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:45,210
pretty much I simply meet of type in

01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:47,040
Wrath so when you combine too much time

01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:49,410
gender there's so many types going

01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:54,270
around so and I see the limit that you

01:22:49,410 --> 01:22:57,420
need to put a lyric hi

01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:59,040
sighs something honey I really do the

01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,260
compiler will warn you about this error

01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,910
so you need to like increase the number

01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:08,230
of parts and then you know detail

01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:12,010
Kabbalah should I go up a lot I mean box

01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:14,980
this would be a bit slower a little bit

01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:19,000
sacrificing performance but they allow

01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:22,920
you to avoid the errors bossy Sykes

01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:30,850
Posse something that your rapport

01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:36,630
rapport to family report or pointer in

01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:44,860
this case a point were dynamic dynamic

01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:47,410
one might say that they make trade this

01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:49,840
new I am this is a trade so they say

01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:54,160
this box is something that contains a

01:23:49,840 --> 01:24:01,450
passer so this one's this one make it

01:23:54,160 --> 01:24:03,100
past past couple but a bit so by one

01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:06,190
note it the Pokemon difference right now

01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:10,810
and let you push my get this one notice

01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:20,050
during during the encoding you hit the

01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:22,710
pipe I mean what they do here is also

01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:22,710
there right contest

01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:51,270
okay a very basic example can be senior

01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:51,270
like

01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:28,760
raka I just show this what like you one

01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:30,860
left item of this is a function when

01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:36,310
when you want the left item of a passer

01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:41,000
and a right the right item of a passer

01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:45,739
you just get the pair and then you get

01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:50,210
the left item and a and a pay how many

01:25:45,739 --> 01:25:55,780
ideas so you you run the first passer

01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:59,860
and then you run the second passer and

01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:59,860
you return both the result

01:26:00,219 --> 01:26:07,929
so this using a pair and where you get

01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:11,360
this part from this is a trait that

01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:14,000
specified for this parcel to have let's

01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:16,239
say this parcel all these implements a

01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,239
passer

01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:29,280
but you can see right the parcel we have

01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:34,650
this pastor and the pastor you have a

01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:36,480
function so for this it means that for

01:26:34,650 --> 01:26:39,960
all the functions that return a pass

01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:42,020
result because here F is all the

01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:48,780
functions that return a part without and

01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:50,160
then you add a function to them so if I

01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:54,000
okay if I can be thought of

01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:55,980
implementation may I repeat just for all

01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,840
the functions that you can implements

01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:00,480
this pathway that they would take their

01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:03,270
function itself and then they run your

01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:18,660
input if you run past you know

01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:28,560
understand okay so in this case you are

01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:31,490
able to define a train the benefit here

01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:56,760
is I you you keep istic and dispatch

01:27:31,490 --> 01:28:00,530
that's the main benefit the red rose

01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:00,530
water from the

01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:14,940
now because you should I think it will

01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:17,190
follow the tutorial like quite long but

01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:21,710
you'll notice I and what I can do this

01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:21,710
with okay let's see a simple method

01:29:27,850 --> 01:29:33,560
[Music]

01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:55,460
no I really they coulda value this.value

01:29:33,560 --> 01:30:05,270
easy daily but not something that can be

01:29:55,460 --> 01:30:07,730
paralyzed very easily so it's like a

01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:10,310
feature to get you to write a better

01:30:07,730 --> 01:30:13,160
code let's say you're a fighter people

01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:15,170
can write or C you can write all

01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:17,810
different kinds of style but sometimes

01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:19,670
you'll get a lot of runtime errors or

01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:56,200
almanarah and you need to change the

01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:56,200
whole program and I guess are rubbish

01:31:06,540 --> 01:32:34,720
no it's because you there's something

01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:37,660
new in let's say ownership you have more

01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:41,240
ownership sand-like times which we don't

01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:44,330
usually speak other languages
