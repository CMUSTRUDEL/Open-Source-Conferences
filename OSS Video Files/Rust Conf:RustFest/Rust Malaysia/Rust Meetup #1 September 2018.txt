	00:00:06,140 --> 00:01:02,910
so now yes okay okay

00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:06,119
start now so fast okay I just get some

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,590
the these are the these are is the last

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:13,439
chemo 2018 the introduce the introducer

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,549
Bourassa no there's none really

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:40,530
introduced they just talked about the

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:45,149
rush 2080 edition okay lastly my name my

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:51,030
name is island have okay so now i will

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:55,860
introduce about the rust and why is Russ

00:01:51,030 --> 00:02:02,070
rusty is a game of course it's a

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:07,979
programming language vicious is out

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:10,229
around round 2009 I think around 2009

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:20,010
after go to and 6o 2009 I had to

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:24,810
remember their languages out 2010 here

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:26,930
first appear 2010 things 2009 when their

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:33,150
wine he's a

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:35,340
is similar no it came out somewhat

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,620
similar to to the time around go

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:43,170
research like few years later after go

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:47,280
both is a system both is the system

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,320
programming language Russ and go but

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,100
then Russ have different focus are so

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:56,180
that it's harder to compare one of the

00:02:53,100 --> 00:03:07,830
main okay here sure is just some

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:17,670
something that's different about us okay

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:20,370
so okay these are safe for from Russ

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,560
conference 2080 I just get from them I

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,739
just want to show a few aside from them

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,410
okay

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,660
so Russ well how is it different they

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:36,000
talk about memory safety without garbage

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:38,480
collection so Russ the mice different

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,860
velocities is a system language

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:47,470
she's focus on

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:52,630
if focus on get the trifecta which is

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:55,870
this is picking from the rust this way

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:59,100
in rust this is focus on the rust noe

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:04,510
focus on three things which is the speed

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:07,240
concurrency and safety so one of the

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,810
thing how they do this is they have

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,360
memory safety they don't have garbage

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,580
collection there's something special

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,760
about Rossi's they have something called

00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,950
ownership model I think that I haven't

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:36,340
seen it on any other major programming

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:56,200
languages so far yeah there is from a

00:04:36,340 --> 00:05:14,500
sub set up so it's just that no but

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:17,430
what's yeah so basically what they say

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,930
is just the enforced garbage collection

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,960
no they don't have the correction and so

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:26,260
the anomaly safety of it is okay so next

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,910
thing they have instruction without

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:34,930
overhead rust is different they're big

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:37,600
they can say is a object-oriented

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:42,310
language programming language the easy

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:47,640
or render depends on how is define rust

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,640
don't have classes but it have traits

00:05:47,870 --> 00:06:08,400
and the structures the structures and

00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,610
those stuff they don't have no

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,700
structures right they don't have the

00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,160
runtime good enough runtime costs so

00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,500
that's why they say we don't okay so

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,930
basically everything is done compiled

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,920
time this some parts have primetime cost

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:29,250
but less me more they focus on reducing

00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:32,190
they focus on the cpu speed not not so

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:37,560
much on memory memory usage by the focus

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:40,590
on the run timer okay next thing is

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,910
different about let's say concurrency

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:47,970
without data races they're in a book

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:51,140
that teaches different methods including

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:54,450
at new taxes atomic reference campaign

00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,500
so they have multiple multiple ways to

00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:01,590
do multiple ways to share data between

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:11,070
between different between different

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:14,310
tress are your channels you have MPSC

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:18,890
multiple producers single consumer like

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:24,720
those kind of things and all of them

00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:27,530
guarantee no data races okay that's how

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,230
that's how a different it'd be processor

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:33,090
but the rest instead of using green

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,990
crest they use system trust there's one

00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:39,690
time they use green press last time 2000

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:42,030
2013 I saw around around the time and

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:45,960
then and then they drop the drop that

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:52,560
clip green so that they want to reduce

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:56,840
the interest and system trust green

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,840
trees are also known as like kress

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,279
[Music]

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:31,760
so the is the goroutines impacts because

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,639
you can

00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,360
[Music]

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:58,850
and it's a library and then the one I

00:11:46,970 --> 00:12:00,140
don't know we are busy Python next the

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:05,870
next thing is stability without

00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:08,510
segmentation stagnation so how do they

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:13,180
show this how their chip is this Russ

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:17,810
2015 and this Russ 2018 which is a

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:21,080
bishop here this year and the rush 2080

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:22,970
is actually a marketing schema so

00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,960
basically you want to attract more

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:30,320
people it's like it's like LPS but then

00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:35,390
the pictures they say you were pure 28

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:38,930
right 2018 like rust essing away it's

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:44,540
not out but then it will be in 2018 it's

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:46,730
just not when 2018 release so the 2050

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,430
one can use a friendiy 18 libraries and

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:53,690
2018 libraries can use the 2015

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:55,370
libraries so this how they say stability

00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,100
because they mention let's say if I

00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:01,490
don't - and Ballantrae sometimes now the

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:28,610
diverse and you used to say into PHP PHP

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:31,130
5 HP 7 you can come hold on Oh Russ same

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,590
in the same Kabbalah in there 2018

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:36,770
addition you need to add in a cargo to

00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:41,230
your ml roster for faculty ml right you

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:44,230
need to add like you need to add this

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,230
yeah

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,369
[Music]

00:14:48,779 --> 00:15:06,100
okay I'll show how I can show my litter

00:14:53,799 --> 00:15:16,329
litter the last so this is the last one

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:19,259
without fear just wanna say it's a lot

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:21,279
of babies you know this body labor that

00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,170
if you do anything wrong

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:29,999
they're just something yeah I didn't get

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:29,999
you that's a okay

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,780
[Laughter]

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:49,939
yeah diminish rest up for you

00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:57,129
the manager rasa basically this should

00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:57,129
install the cargo cargo is Russ package

00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:06,980
it's not Rasta the rest of combination

00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:11,470
similar to go up and install Russ see

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:14,470
Roskam other formats plus for me know

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,470
anything

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:26,010
these are the components and in sosamma

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:28,920
let's say Russ and lisas iOS preview the

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,020
RS is the wrost language server they

00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,520
also put it as a component why write a

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,620
player's component and that doesn't

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,440
place a rustic red raspberries RS

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:41,100
package require a screen you can ingress

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,360
you can cargo install a crate let's see

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:49,110
if you want to install rip grab cargo

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:53,370
cargo to the store grab then you can

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:55,230
install the RIP grab but then how come

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:59,130
they want to do this because every time

00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:02,840
let's say this because RS like KP that

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:08,040
depends on that depends on the rust

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:10,049
distribute the rust API so when when you

00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:17,370
have a new version the internet appear I

00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:21,870
might might change and so every time you

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:25,350
do rust up update if you update the your

00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:28,220
update to late latest stable version and

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:33,450
latest for me I have to I have to

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:36,799
therefore 3 version of Russ the people

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:40,679
used one is stable but I and nightly I

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,620
just installed to to to change no no

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:51,830
they called to change I just installed a

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:51,830
stable and my version cross compile I

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:08,780
did cry when the devil for me because

00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,780
either mus L to change border

00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,380
this is someone that are they - the

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,179
secret still the same seed will change

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:29,850
now so you need to install the two

00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:32,059
chambers but if muscle to change easy to

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:36,500
install here I can adjust it in the

00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:40,280
stable next in the next question muscles

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:53,220
so they can put it into the

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:55,200
twice already know but no but you still

00:19:53,220 --> 00:20:05,400
need to install them install the muscles

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:12,659
upon muscle is faster master is faster

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:17,750
and smaller you see no app is running on

00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:17,750
muscle so small there's no it's possible

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:33,419
no tools the tools they use is the bench

00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:35,520
mat yes it's cool I don't think it they

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,320
are something days faster yeah I guess

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,950
faster then I didn't remember I did

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,780
before bench mat for that I don't know I

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,760
don't think it's completely fastest

00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,760
underneath for every room is different

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:56,309
but it's much cleaner in it he doesn't

00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:59,299
have those cover over the years heck

00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:59,299
like she lives here

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:15,550
yeah that's what they advertise and they

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:17,370
stop the GPO okay so the so that's why

00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,930
people use it to do static primarily

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:23,050
okay so the component basically every

00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:25,210
time you update the rest using rest up

00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:28,780
the tool they provide they were happy to

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,310
update the although the older components

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:39,730
so there are many shape for you so

00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:41,410
that's why I prefer rasa yeah and then

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:46,420
and then you break the whole

00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:58,240
installation yeah

00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:59,950
now campaign yes I get an error so know

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:19,600
this I think this way

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:23,920
you know I do know usually is not the

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:27,220
rustics not not working usually is yeah

00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:33,580
usually it's iOS preview that's I got

00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:35,140
one is from iOS previously I don't know

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,290
what that guy is the thing around this

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,290
week

00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:54,279
yeah I also yeah and you saw there's a

00:22:51,669 --> 00:23:02,799
few your super cache here that I found

00:22:54,279 --> 00:23:15,490
is a one one is rust the tippy fish

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:16,809
checks for the miss one yeah I sleep is

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:22,860
the Linda and then they're so so low

00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:46,450
fixer call cargo fix no Russ Russ fixer

00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:49,120
brass fix it's the let's say they have a

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:58,090
language idioms and then you can fix for

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:59,950
the idiom so so right edition idioms so

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,830
let's say you have some performance

00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,580
issue they have a lot of liens are

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:08,200
basically from KP if one of those

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:11,679
doesn't pass the least doesn't mean that

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,899
it is not clean some nice show new

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:23,080
easier the better way to do stuff yeah

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:36,100
but away let's see let's see the calm

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:38,169
you have Combinator's you do some you do

00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:41,269
map and then you do next

00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:44,419
then they were suggested to do fine for

00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:47,690
communities it's very functional program

00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:49,969
level I mean the because most of the

00:24:47,690 --> 00:25:26,029
like Hesco in Stockdale just suggest you

00:24:49,969 --> 00:26:23,419
like if you write something because no I

00:25:26,029 --> 00:26:27,769
mean but that deserve this does FLSA so

00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:30,650
they're very a lot of base careful of

00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:36,180
Lisa just so

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:39,390
Dean so you uh you optominute similar to

00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:42,240
like like your yes lien or baby like so

00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:46,350
that open for for those rules to be

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,360
applied all actually just all these

00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,460
rules are you don't need to open

00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,250
yourself there autumn there upside those

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,320
apply to know that doesn't apply or

00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,780
there's some that don't apply the lien

00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,640
groups right salius is some sort of my

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,250
open but there's a big falsetto yeah

00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,280
that's the default d4 is quite so really

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,700
quite nice so I didn't I don't change

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,700
the father

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:36,530
let's say there's a function called

00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,330
futile map in rust and it does to Tommy

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:42,090
both at the same time

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:45,120
so the suggest you not to use these are

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:49,110
let's say if you do filter if you do

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,350
filter here and then do map never

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,840
suggest you not to do this so they just

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,990
call you to use filter map right if you

00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:05,010
run raw Swee'Pea you must run on Nighy

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:08,580
like rust okay I'll go lightly creepy

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:13,610
and then and then you check out you

00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,610
check your create check error for you

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:21,750
yeah this one this one man the filter

00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:24,900
next so you do a filter and then you do

00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,570
a next so they will just suggest you to

00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:40,530
your fine

00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:42,020
Adisa yeah nobody they tell you to write

00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:45,289
inside you this way

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:47,210
like I thought it something like the

00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:51,140
Hesco values actually they process the

00:28:47,210 --> 00:29:08,049
algorithm whatever there is shop is for

00:28:51,140 --> 00:29:08,049
you I don't think algorithm is okay so

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:17,390
okay so just so hello officer and the

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,220
difference we're before Google is when

00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,710
we're project you actually to specify

00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:25,880
whether it's likely or binary poacher

00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:29,630
yes here is a car go to your mail you

00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,990
specify why's the rest credible so this

00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:35,600
is the binary yeah and then and then you

00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,539
can see SRC there's a main power it's

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,940
pretty standard right now like other

00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:43,730
projects right in rust their helpers SRC

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:46,190
directory for source files rather done

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:51,020
the past if you see a main power insider

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:54,919
SRC means that you can cargo run and

00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:57,230
then if you if you see a library you can

00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:03,740
calc of you what's the convention if I

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:23,990
want I buy a project but I also know

00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:25,850
that I mean you can you can have some

00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:28,730
projects right you can have more than

00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,559
one binary and then I don't I don't know

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,649
if folder they put I think they're put

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,570
into SRC as I see it being here I think

00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:37,340
they put here probably and then the

00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,649
points are the bean and then date you

00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,510
can have multiple binaries some projects

00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:44,350
that most project goes in there when you

00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:46,669
have one my so when you're okay she's

00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:49,100
likely and also by the way how do you

00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:52,580
when you input it is consider more or

00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,309
consider external input from the library

00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,159
no idea from your

00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:59,529
it's considered external input into the

00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:08,379
import all crates you must do externally

00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:14,139
but let's say okay let's say sir Oki

00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:16,239
shows that some so this is one thing

00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:18,279
about strong about Russ one library

00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:22,450
that's very strong is that it does

00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:25,090
serialization and deserialization me

00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,259
something unique and I think I didn't

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,690
ever seen this somewhere else

00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,999
but I thought yeah but I thought Jason

00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:37,389
right they fancy view are just stops a

00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:50,409
dead give you a low he say like you

00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:54,059
would see the well first I thought this

00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:56,349
library right you can all then all the

00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:58,389
celebrity the same oh they have the same

00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,690
syntax or may have the from Raider to

00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:10,960
writer

00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:16,570
aunt you are right the being you derive

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:30,429
just stop saying yes the code from the

00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:35,369
treasure just okay so here our install

00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:35,369
sir yes sir Jason

00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:52,820
we saw the work which can be hello ah

00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,909
okay

00:32:52,820 --> 00:33:00,409
I still need the extraneous path this is

00:32:55,909 --> 00:33:04,520
a main function but this is something

00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:07,820
different this is a macro the print

00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:12,110
place a micro queen is a smile or a

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:50,930
smirk oh he expands the function into

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:56,980
multiple paths in a ways it does a bit

00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:56,980
of cogeneration it's very common

00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:06,440
Lisa it's a very common dish about one

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,890
thing I don't like is the the crate

00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,440
right they can Amy come here - the

00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:15,970
chemists only finding it is they can

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,290
they can make it - the Oh underscore

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:21,080
sunlight I don't remember whether it is

00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:25,430
underscore or - you see are some crates

00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:32,330
there - and some crazy underscore is

00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:35,030
just confusing up it's fine okay this is

00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,670
to expand the macro so this is the

00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:41,170
expanded version for the pin pin line

00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,170
macro this is micro

00:34:41,440 --> 00:36:37,660
yeah okay okay it's a little thing

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:26,490
okay okay

00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:54,100
yeah I know okay I'll just go up like go

00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:57,370
back up like okay goes to squat like

00:37:54,100 --> 00:38:01,210
your every message list the one was like

00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:04,620
aborting due to previous area do you

00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:06,480
want dessert and you can show this help

00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:27,160
times

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:29,530
yeah you see the binary Oh Mac okay

00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:41,050
breweries for release try to appeal a

00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:44,040
release Melia with you you're the you're

00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:44,040
the model tell us stop

00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,469
[Music]

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:23,640
this way the coin decide in c-plus was

00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:25,410
generic is called tempering which is if

00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,940
you read what if you remove two dead

00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,860
booty-shaking let they say you're not

00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,200
using so right now if you remove them

00:39:28,860 --> 00:40:05,280
build up an entry smaller or if this

00:39:31,200 --> 00:40:20,340
tree shaking for you sure so you can

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:22,680
take the size there's something to check

00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:26,910
on what occupy the space of the wrath

00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:29,400
great they're quite cargo do another

00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:32,750
quick these are the stuff they are

00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:36,390
useful for beginners so this is useful

00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:39,630
how I feel there's one time where crap

00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:42,960
crap it's a rust for rust command line

00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:46,370
passer he does love command line stuff I

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:50,790
basically it can also generate the

00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:51,990
competition do the help helping all the

00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,090
commands and stuff pretty bouquet

00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:56,070
last time it was big the older binding

00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:59,870
here so big then optimize the size

00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,870
because they use a lot of macros

00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,950
[Laughter]

00:41:52,670 --> 00:42:30,869
you know just focus this year 2018 they

00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:33,359
focus on the no King no there another

00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:36,089
parameter in a networking group they

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,220
have treat think create tree subgroup

00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:42,920
now we can group the icing now King

00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,920
icing now King embedded and networking

00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:48,319
now King now King services

00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:00,450
no they want to build something called

00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:10,950
rice but the rational second tray quite

00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:14,460
tall means the rice of supposed to bring

00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:17,490
up all the Nell beside a baseline of

00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,440
class-by-class as the base and you can

00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:24,900
be used by all the other web components

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:27,960
yaaaaaay standardization body on the

00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,730
boost up there working so he goes to

00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,340
make it better right now that i think i

00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,860
io palace very bad nine rust died the

00:43:32,340 --> 00:44:09,000
Nome King I all yondu a Singh you get

00:43:34,860 --> 00:44:15,960
hit eager right no you check wish what

00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:21,900
quit occupies most of space yeah I'm

00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:27,530
good sir okay so there's a critter she

00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:30,590
other over here we could be good okay

00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:37,370
which they can be good so everything see

00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:37,370
ready I never I then reverse right

00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:53,370
okay this is why I do paucity fr I think

00:44:51,340 --> 00:45:12,340
the possibilities not here so I sit here

00:44:53,370 --> 00:45:22,890
but [ __ ] for school well everybody

00:45:12,340 --> 00:46:02,830
doesn't know about it so after the game

00:45:22,890 --> 00:46:07,110
for security you pod Esau what one is

00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:10,810
you get a say and then you get enough

00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:11,320
and the other one is your text and one

00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:15,250
depend

00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:19,540
yeah okay so these are two didn't work

00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:22,150
you see I this is that for you need to

00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:23,470
for the streams oh you know I asked you

00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,680
don't get those I still don't get it

00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,680
working

00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,880
these are communities right and you oh I

00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,530
don't get why is this yeah I cannot get

00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,770
it working so they're mine I'm asking

00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,770
ago

00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:57,690
okay which I use okay let's say now I

00:46:53,260 --> 00:47:00,670
have a structure after structure a

00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:24,190
structure yeah I'm gonna see what I see

00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:26,260
- okay I have a name in it so whereas

00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:34,630
the the integers that you need to

00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:40,060
manually specify the pizza is almost

00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:46,000
like a static string and the string

00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:47,950
knife okay now I have haha there's two

00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:57,420
kind of string inverse Y one is SD I

00:47:47,950 --> 00:48:02,160
wanna bring way what's different yeah

00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:02,160
train him you can use both

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:42,809
but you can use nobody if you do this

00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:45,460
you can use both you can use either STRs

00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:47,440
string you can flyyy both we can use

00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:50,349
together you can use either fer or you

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,250
can use string also again this is Nicole

00:48:50,349 --> 00:49:17,440
clone alright

00:48:51,250 --> 00:49:19,270
clone on right or copy right there for

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:25,780
two traits two different treatments copy

00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:42,640
one is clone the removal okay okay let's

00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:46,089
say okay oh no she although further no

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:53,010
malicious you you get do you see other

00:49:46,089 --> 00:49:53,010
thing about you're reusing an extra line

00:49:53,700 --> 00:50:07,000
okay lady should right yeah oh that is

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:08,260
not extra not like wheeler but unless

00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,700
you be something that you hit you in the

00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,089
face directly right when you try to

00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,089
right

00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:28,500
but I think they write harder to Tom oh

00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:53,940
this what's it's not it's not on Russ is

00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:55,680
not so direct the ketchup projector so

00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:59,490
you have to show like once you pass into

00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:03,630
function those things like stop capture

00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:14,069
that you face if you kind of start what

00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:53,160
do you mean like that consumed after you

00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:56,539
pass in do you know at that time so here

00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:59,549
they explain so if you want to have

00:51:56,539 --> 00:52:01,769
shown up in a structure you cannot just

00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:05,299
pretty like this you need to print it

00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:05,299
with these forty back

00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:14,560
this one as well I'll just show ya

00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:18,110
because then you need to have be back

00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:21,140
into implemented be back for the

00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:36,580
structure so here is how generation come

00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:36,580
in structure

00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:49,420
automatically increments the line for

00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:52,880
you so this this thing they generate

00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:54,890
with the strong then we will know yeah

00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:01,190
you just take it this will generate code

00:52:54,890 --> 00:53:11,630
for the people know the general for this

00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:20,890
the generate so you can attach this to

00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:20,890
anything that needs any but if you want

00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:28,820
yeah but you need to the the fuse inside

00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:31,720
that also need to implement let's say if

00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:51,440
two structures one depend on the other

00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:52,970
both must implement no the question is

00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,060
the code generation

00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:56,060
[Music]

00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:16,350
he buys the cogeneration go to the paper

00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:23,220
okay let's see what happens when you

00:54:20,890 --> 00:55:15,910
print it two times

00:54:23,220 --> 00:55:18,790
okay here comes Tim yeah so this one

00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:29,640
cannot be user medicine it is from the

00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:33,280
poor yeah this works and then this means

00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:38,440
the ampersand means borrow in rust so

00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:44,790
this you just pin a bar abortion and for

00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:44,790
is borrowed from I won so I can

00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:54,210
they call you know because it just

00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:58,350
borrows different components to like my

00:55:54,210 --> 00:56:00,030
teapot to pass the world my people it

00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:27,350
doesn't borrow by the Saudis transfer

00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:27,350
the ownership okay now I show okay ready

00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:48,090
you know you said so what this macro use

00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:49,860
means for that like so that is so like

00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:51,990
parasite a decorator for the particular

00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,550
statement after afterwards yeah

00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:55,340
or you can do it like this but this

00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:59,280
thing you'll be destroyed already in

00:56:55,340 --> 00:57:03,630
russia 2018 you will be gone oh you'll

00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:07,350
be automatically imported in a way yes

00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:11,990
because this is duplicated you see the

00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:15,020
cargo you see this here this replicated

00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:20,460
so in 2018 you don't need to write this

00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:22,170
what's first a new thing you don't need

00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,760
my keys oh so you'll be part of the

00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:26,480
package no explain quick you don't need

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,710
to write like that maybe they - oh oh

00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:33,240
when you bring the cargo it will be

00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:44,880
imported can see that imported yeah the

00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:48,810
one is in a trendy Athena yeah okay now

00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:51,710
I need to use this one is provided

00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:53,860
inside arrived this serialization and

00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:56,250
this

00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:58,570
Cyril I saw serialize and deserialize

00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:02,550
this was a cogeneration they generate

00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,550
the serialize code for other people and

00:58:48,420 --> 00:59:02,500
what is that like use you said use is to

00:58:52,480 --> 00:59:05,320
bring the you import to this just like

00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:31,060
using okay

00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:35,400
using okay okay on a type result way so

00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:35,400
technical result lease where

00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,079
[Music]

01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:26,869
you want to put it into the

01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:39,180
[Laughter]

01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:18,260
[Laughter]

01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:32,830
[Laughter]

01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:39,670
okay now I'll create a new file this

01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:44,740
Kshama is to be customized to delegate

01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:46,930
the error to previous function so

01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:50,890
basically there's no that's why the

01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:52,090
previous one out of me okay the Impe is

01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:55,780
taught by Magica they have some

01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:59,080
explaining insider up see there's some

01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:01,420
termination trade so bassy it fails here

01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:07,870
because open is for pre and creates for

01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:13,410
right so yeah and it was here so in case

01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:13,410
just now like okay

01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:24,450
okay so now the hallways here right but

01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:27,309
then I remove the write permission I

01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:30,249
don't think you run ready you see and

01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:35,400
then it won't run here so if you do want

01:03:30,249 --> 01:03:35,400
to delegate the error you can do like

01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:49,980
Umesh this nice time at this house okay

01:04:18,569 --> 01:04:49,769
so yeah so yeah so you show time because

01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:53,619
it cannot write and then now he works

01:04:49,769 --> 01:04:55,499
because this one you can check you can

01:04:53,619 --> 01:04:57,970
use this pattern to check for the

01:04:55,499 --> 01:05:04,690
weather emotional but then you must

01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:07,119
match all the items there no you won't

01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:11,710
just remind you filter your filter field

01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:16,680
because everything you need to measure

01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:16,680
another result

01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:39,040
yeah this is a phenom function funky

01:05:38,230 --> 01:06:05,140
this keys

01:05:39,040 --> 01:06:08,740
you would be fine it's okay this is also

01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:11,020
in Haskell but the enum can have stopped

01:06:08,740 --> 01:07:04,830
inside but you're in um can contains

01:06:11,020 --> 01:07:04,830
values so implement enum play you know

01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:10,710
okay right now the state is

01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:47,610
[Laughter]

01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:51,630
you can have a vector they can put a

01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:56,490
lecture here you can pull vector here

01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:57,750
and look and this is actually very if

01:07:56,490 --> 01:08:00,480
you want to implement at fees actually

01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:05,370
very easy to implement free I'm not sure

01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:10,080
how any captures in first okay I'll put

01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:26,010
by a panel fee where no entry and no

01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:29,300
entry okay I see self container no we

01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:29,300
did want we want pepper

01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:55,440
how do you do that I will if I want to

01:08:51,450 --> 01:09:05,000
do that hmm it's a persistent if you

01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:05,000
want you to put this way okay this is ha

01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:30,480
[Laughter]

01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:32,940
okay you know right why the recipe now

01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:35,990
need to match all the other information

01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:38,490
if you do that is right you fail because

01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:43,050
they don't know what to do when you

01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:57,510
sleep you can you can add like this but

01:09:43,050 --> 01:10:00,660
you must specify yourself nothing you do

01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:02,940
man you do mesh or your bank or you can

01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:12,060
do is that if that is basically measure

01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:15,170
but mash is easier sometimes I think

01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:18,720
it's not covered so they allow you to

01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:24,660
they'll tell you to use data so you need

01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:26,820
to measure in you measure if you don't

01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:39,360
return anything so useless you must

01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:41,960
return something else oh yeah now you

01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,960
need to return

01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:53,090
[Laughter]

01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:05,980
[Laughter]

01:11:16,329 --> 01:11:51,820
yes so basically what yeah

01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:41,539
nice the same time you put the semaphore

01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:46,190
you say oh no they don't support you no

01:12:41,539 --> 01:12:48,230
can you carry Union you can know they

01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:48,870
have Union in a rustic 2018 but you need

01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:55,100
and safer

01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:55,100
[Laughter]

01:13:21,800 --> 01:14:10,260
example to have union see ya

01:13:28,079 --> 01:14:26,489
see gonna see example sequester they use

01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:29,080
Union from a community do the software

01:14:26,489 --> 01:14:31,890
industry and I use also

01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:34,300
[Music]

01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:38,309
[Applause]

01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:38,309
[Laughter]

01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:51,360
[Music]

01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:51,360
[Laughter]

01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:59,510
[Laughter]

01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:51,970
so what's the best use sometimes it does

01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:51,970
not really matter

01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,600
[Music]

01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:13,160
pepper - yeah we're pretty much I use

01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:25,060
whatever for a stop a lot of them their

01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:37,490
solution and I would fix I think so that

01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:40,700
have destroyed settings we there they

01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:42,590
are show like it's all staff so show

01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:47,990
which one is good which is bad okay so

01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:52,970
there's no so it's no so but they can

01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:55,199
you can see the support for didn't

01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:58,219
support is quite good

01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:58,219
getting there

01:17:30,920 --> 01:18:32,090
yeah yeah yeah gdb I could get one

01:18:30,959 --> 01:18:38,140
movies I just

01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:38,140
[Laughter]

01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:49,359
now if I use me ask on my battery will

01:18:40,659 --> 01:18:52,929
be 0 by now oh sorry sorry idea that you

01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:55,510
think they are useful for the resources

01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:57,699
useful is already this book and example

01:18:55,510 --> 01:19:01,749
the example is the rest by example

01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:04,739
so pretty much useful if you want can

01:19:01,749 --> 01:19:09,909
check yourself that you discover that we

01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:16,239
we cannot go like ok let's start them in

01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:18,780
discover your discovered every week they

01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:21,849
post some cool blog post

01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:31,329
this is destroying other cool and the

01:19:21,849 --> 01:19:50,010
knock one maybe no it's not in a knocko

01:19:31,329 --> 01:19:51,999
is just cool but not there so focus on

01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:53,649
this you know they also focus on the

01:19:51,999 --> 01:19:56,349
blogging a lot of people blots over us

01:19:53,649 --> 01:19:58,809
and you see that every day people right

01:19:56,349 --> 01:20:00,369
I think almost 100 today like to a few

01:19:58,809 --> 01:20:04,659
new post will come out and they're in

01:20:00,369 --> 01:20:06,489
different sectors times if I have time I

01:20:04,659 --> 01:20:10,149
read if I have a lot of time other

01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:14,319
anything to do already finish everything

01:20:10,149 --> 01:20:17,049
but I cannot finish ah if you have just

01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:19,869
read this okay after I read the book

01:20:17,049 --> 01:20:22,780
after I read the book this API is very

01:20:19,869 --> 01:20:24,189
useful you can API documentation you can

01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:24,760
read the documentation instead of

01:20:24,189 --> 01:20:28,419
searching online

01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:34,959
uh next one very slow and the rusty book

01:20:28,419 --> 01:20:38,079
is not my desire no no the navigation

01:20:34,959 --> 01:20:41,699
takes time because this already is this

01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:41,699
nice applying no scratches faster

01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:55,900
yeah on the brows on the line you can

01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:59,560
use the play if you do have brush you

01:20:55,900 --> 01:21:07,300
can use these paper rustling yes now you

01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:13,320
can use this will the most we can stop

01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:16,930
and basically in a documentation write

01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:19,620
the book you can just you can just click

01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:23,820
in and they're running the let's see I

01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:23,820
remember you can run you can run this

01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:34,880
[Laughter]

01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:41,530
rusty bullets not helpful

01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:50,130
no because nice for internal team

01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:52,930
internet staff no this one is crept the

01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:58,960
inside inside the staff are so basic not

01:21:52,930 --> 01:22:03,730
sue for me cargo book a bit helpful when

01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:05,170
you want to write because you don't need

01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:06,910
it all the time just radio once and then

01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:17,140
he's done but like the book he always

01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:19,570
changed so what I do is I go into Kabul

01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:22,450
cream service credit is very similar to

01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:23,770
the one in a credit Eddie is very

01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:29,140
similar to the second teacher I want to

01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:33,370
log in replaced so I mean the stuff it

01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:35,400
like might raise some interest so for

01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:37,960
some of the non brass people know that

01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:41,320
the after the second addition their car

01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:43,710
water features like tall basic house

01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,710
everything

01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:47,230
yeah

01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:13,940
[Laughter]

01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:33,190
[Laughter]

01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:18,020
[Laughter]

01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:49,109
[Music]

01:24:49,810 --> 01:25:04,450
maybe come and look like it's a custom

01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:24,110
concurrency model before previously

01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:27,590
compartir on in the library

01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:32,630
pasta acing awake for Odessa promise for

01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:34,880
the promise I'll do this nobody's not oh

01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:38,710
yeah I remember day I think I remember

01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,710
they change the track

01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:58,939
[Music]

01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:52,260
[Laughter]

01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:55,270
everything is legally they show you

01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:55,270
different examples

01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:03,710
[Music]

01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,710
[Laughter]

01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:24,389
but they want you to read the know me

01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:24,389
confess re-weigh stomach on cycle fast

01:28:28,829 --> 01:28:35,050
but so far you can only write the one

01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:43,599
that I show always if you save your new

01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:45,550
label unsafe SIUC basic unsafe write and

01:28:43,599 --> 01:28:52,840
say pass and simple basically means that

01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:55,690
you escape although check ya know Russ

01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:57,579
is basically it is the carpets then

01:28:55,690 --> 01:29:06,550
write it unsafe but they wrap it with

01:28:57,579 --> 01:29:09,219
safe API yeah question I see your Python

01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:13,570
the grass is for safety if compared to

01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:16,250
see so compared to see basically what by

01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:19,829
the nice view but you can do see with

01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:22,210
[Laughter]

01:29:19,829 --> 01:29:43,590
you want me to write you a [ __ ] another

01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:43,590
face buggy I know I just follow there

01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:08,020
they say writing in Russ writing state

01:30:04,989 --> 01:30:10,360
code in Russ is easy correct code in

01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:12,809
Russ is easy but writing fast Cody Ross

01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:17,880
is not easy

01:30:12,809 --> 01:30:17,880
so it's safety if the first thing yeah

01:30:22,469 --> 01:30:27,480
and speedy payment also because you

01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:30,460
because you saved so they can do more

01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:33,909
know that they say writing correct code

01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:54,280
in Russ is easy but writing Fusco is hot

01:30:33,909 --> 01:30:55,900
but you can write you need to know yeah

01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:57,730
and also he said that the safe thing is

01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:59,230
I think the save feature so it means

01:30:57,730 --> 01:31:00,519
that if you throw it to any program

01:30:59,230 --> 01:31:14,199
where they cannot screw up your code a

01:31:00,519 --> 01:31:16,059
master unless they you see yeah sure a

01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:17,500
lot of people that write the rest is

01:31:16,059 --> 01:31:21,159
actually coming from people they write

01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:24,280
50 now that those that are right unsafe

01:31:21,159 --> 01:31:25,539
see that usually doesn't go too right

01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,550
in other words you are saying is that

01:31:25,539 --> 01:31:29,710
for those people who are used to or even

01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:33,929
see sometimes they just want to switch

01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:33,929
over to us because to get benefit of

01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:50,650
record system audio system knows the are

01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:52,100
super much you will be reading to us

01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:53,580
because

01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:58,870
[Music]

01:31:53,580 --> 01:32:01,550
[Laughter]

01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:04,640
though the one there likes to write safe

01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:06,500
code wheeling Python Python programmers

01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:13,130
are so willing to sushi because of the

01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:15,260
performance yeah I didn't see is very so

01:32:13,130 --> 01:33:14,960
like after I switched from Valencia to

01:32:15,260 --> 01:33:32,300
Rossi is here just tapping - - I like

01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:39,950
this stock index one yeah like the arrow

01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:42,850
for a sign you wanna do this we need to

01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:42,850
carry this into one

01:33:45,190 --> 01:34:04,660
he's not a shady that's harder to do and

01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:15,100
the leather cuff is fine no but they

01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:28,620
have another book just once a week when

01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:28,620
I should be they have a things are we

01:34:32,010 --> 01:35:11,980
today at my rust library for all these

01:34:39,400 --> 01:35:23,470
rusty so exorcism is unlike X is or like

01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:39,400
X exercise exercise they are not score

01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:44,250
focus yeah SQL has SQLite visa whoa

01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:44,250
don't long answer man good

01:35:48,669 --> 01:36:37,070
that's always a sign to the same join

01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:49,099
yes mentor 35% for use it for writing

01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:55,340
common I application will show for

01:36:49,099 --> 01:36:58,099
school timetable school scheduling last

01:36:55,340 --> 01:37:01,969
time used to be written in show

01:36:58,099 --> 01:37:21,139
transcript already in around around 10

01:37:01,969 --> 01:37:29,780
lines constraint see the schedule no

01:37:21,139 --> 01:37:32,389
Barack is so long and right so I just

01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:36,439
write in basically I think three lines

01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:40,729
and one very long pipe expenses are

01:37:36,439 --> 01:37:44,269
planes Michelle but after their switch

01:37:40,729 --> 01:37:46,579
to the not CSV nothing provides you see

01:37:44,269 --> 01:37:49,300
now they use Jason Jason I cannot I

01:37:46,579 --> 01:37:49,300
can't do it Jason

01:37:49,429 --> 01:37:55,850
well I know it can you steer Cuba I

01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:57,530
don't explain take you I mean I'll quit

01:37:55,850 --> 01:38:00,260
is not it's not that nice

01:37:57,530 --> 01:38:05,330
I need I need to have a lot of lines in

01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:08,540
jq2 passive so I just I just ready Russ

01:38:05,330 --> 01:39:09,290
I do the cashing those no I squat it's

01:38:08,540 --> 01:39:15,850
quite it's quite fine to write one

01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:15,850
example Michael when you see my example

01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:41,830
forgiveness we can pick a please

01:39:53,639 --> 01:40:09,909
wait the more you see these macro I this

01:40:06,969 --> 01:40:14,530
mail call you generate a whole mistaking

01:40:09,909 --> 01:40:52,289
from soda this will generate the whole

01:40:14,530 --> 01:40:52,289
enum form this say this right you see

01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:56,829
this

01:40:54,610 --> 01:41:00,400
no I cook I used up my off to buy that

01:40:56,829 --> 01:41:01,530
that there is the ass is - oh and you

01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:06,070
updated

01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:11,590
so you see the ass hyper the about you

01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:12,969
know and then they need to manually they

01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:15,579
need to match the value here and then

01:41:12,969 --> 01:41:18,820
they need to return the output so

01:41:15,579 --> 01:41:22,179
instead of doing that I just do one of

01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:26,579
these and then done this implements the

01:41:22,179 --> 01:41:29,229
serializable as well through that trade

01:41:26,579 --> 01:41:32,050
serialize and deserialize trade so I

01:41:29,229 --> 01:41:35,289
don't need to write value 0 equals to

01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:39,639
what the other one you customize but it

01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:41,610
will cost one it automatically does that

01:41:39,639 --> 01:41:45,929
for me

01:41:41,610 --> 01:41:45,929
this is based on the cert code

01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:53,940
so they want to have enough

01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:58,060
representation serialize anomic number

01:41:53,940 --> 01:42:00,010
so they carry hala right rather than

01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:02,980
rather than every time you need to match

01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:05,800
the origin no one match the Vario zero

01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:09,100
back to these you can you can just

01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:17,170
straight you can just straight create TC

01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:21,550
nama you see here this macro the brass

01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:26,740
Michael you can match based on the based

01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:30,550
on the where ian no the past the rough

01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:36,510
structure this is like let's say this

01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:40,720
identifier no this is not like this not

01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:43,690
cross library this for benchmarking

01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:47,860
benchmarking serialization and

01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:52,390
deserialization so basically you see

01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:53,800
here is identifier this is a macro macro

01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:56,470
grass I just not the one that you show

01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:59,770
in say this is a longer version that

01:42:56,470 --> 01:43:03,850
does a macro on the on something IDs on

01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:14,980
this but let's say this this is

01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:16,440
identifier because you don't need you

01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:20,740
did it to write like this

01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:22,540
don't be ready oh you're the right is to

01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:24,310
match the original value you want to

01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:27,700
match it back to the enough your the

01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:30,130
converter in am to number no you want to

01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:35,590
write it as number instead of writing it

01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:39,570
as string this is reading as this string

01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:42,720
by the polarizer will write a string

01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:46,770
dctp proto unknown they'll make it ring

01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:46,770
instead of making it zero

01:43:55,200 --> 01:44:09,280
why just it's just converting the enum

01:43:58,630 --> 01:44:13,210
to numbers just like that my ass right

01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:20,520
sure I don't think I I needed show

01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:20,520
implementation here implementation trace

01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:36,220
yeah pretty much like Lisa your souvenir

01:44:30,610 --> 01:44:39,690
is match in the structured so this one -

01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:54,580
today I saw today's quite useful is the

01:44:39,690 --> 01:45:10,810
creating knows packet e by it's like

01:44:54,580 --> 01:45:22,690
he's from the Rascon príncipe from press

01:45:10,810 --> 01:45:25,240
conference no spit no speaka p okay so

01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:27,550
this explained the guy when talk about

01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:28,750
translating 80 years of hot water best

01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:30,270
practice from other programming

01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:36,030
paradigms to rust

01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:39,790
he explains like step by step how one

01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:44,680
Oxana expected PE and he explained

01:45:39,790 --> 01:45:48,700
inside from zero to writing a cache from

01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:53,890
zero to more how do i improve improvise

01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:55,240
in addition i improvise it all to pass I

01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:58,020
thought you say too slow

01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:58,020
yes I

01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:22,070
so basically they're there I put it on

01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:23,900
auto auto so a ten you see I just show

01:46:22,070 --> 01:46:40,040
you why at the end you can see something

01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:50,780
idea sharing this quite nice security

01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:54,970
rate what is the most basic one then

01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:54,970
they slowly expensive oh no ma

01:46:58,070 --> 01:47:01,170
[Music]

01:47:30,010 --> 01:48:41,620
it's very slow I mean compared to other

01:47:32,410 --> 01:48:46,140
women by their tree roots right for not

01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:48,400
just that true one is that you can have

01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:53,650
two at the same time

01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:55,510
one is borrow you can have immutable

01:48:53,650 --> 01:49:00,460
borrow and multiple borrow at the same

01:48:55,510 --> 01:49:05,080
time let's say you borrow before this I

01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:08,130
see nobody can have multiple mute but

01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:08,130
you can have multiple

01:49:15,139 --> 01:49:18,139
with

01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:35,270
[Music]

01:51:44,000 --> 01:52:40,140
yes now like this one you see this this

01:51:53,130 --> 01:52:44,930
is coach this function oh you something

01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:44,930
like okay sure

01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:03,510
[Music]

01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:49,179
but if let's say if I'm not mistaken

01:53:47,530 --> 01:54:16,480
when you declare

01:53:49,179 --> 01:54:24,610
Aradia you must clear sigh so beautiful

01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:44,309
I have erased me the boy square this

01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:44,309
example culture I mean this cada

01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:24,159
[Music]

01:55:36,679 --> 01:55:43,199
why do you need to put a bracket out but

01:55:41,040 --> 01:56:03,510
you need to put a bracket out the the

01:55:43,199 --> 01:56:37,080
bracket in if before the because we want

01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:41,120
to save num num STD nom you saw that non

01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:41,120
non zero un key

01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:53,199
[Laughter]

01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:08,330
nice legs me you bring it but funny

01:57:06,350 --> 01:57:12,230
thing is if they say actually really to

01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:15,530
use of select if you listen it wouldn't

01:57:12,230 --> 01:57:18,670
want one channel and it's not unlike

01:57:15,530 --> 01:57:27,980
select wishes it's not single flow

01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:29,420
succeed by is event but it's in a way

01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:32,240
it's like something like concurrent also

01:57:29,420 --> 01:57:34,910
like but it's actually not if you want

01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:37,430
it to be if you only have one this is

01:57:34,910 --> 01:58:10,010
one channel I want to do checking you

01:57:37,430 --> 01:58:12,350
myself just use a switch what do what do

01:58:10,010 --> 01:58:13,170
why do you mention STD in the first

01:58:12,350 --> 01:58:17,550
place

01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:17,550
[Laughter]

01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:26,770
[Music]

01:58:39,960 --> 01:59:19,120
like what how many it's actually shorter

01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:33,390
oh okay these mashup there are seems to

01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:49,120
be worried about how come you don't do

01:59:33,390 --> 01:59:53,490
bow how can you does how can your look

01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:53,490
you don't do Wow Wow change

01:59:54,870 --> 01:59:59,770
[Laughter]

02:00:37,730 --> 02:00:44,200
[Laughter]

02:00:58,980 --> 02:01:39,640
what Wendy what is that we do how to do

02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:42,220
with the serialization got so many

02:01:39,640 --> 02:01:44,610
beginners right see too many beginners

02:01:42,220 --> 02:01:44,610
right

02:02:40,230 --> 02:02:48,300
[Laughter]

02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:57,690
therefore c'mon I choose it doesn't

02:03:56,430 --> 02:04:00,450
matter because you don't need one ones

02:03:57,690 --> 02:04:03,860
most time but for like long-running

02:04:00,450 --> 02:04:03,860
process it might make for sense

02:04:51,209 --> 02:05:05,249
it's small nobody's item is ready debate

02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:24,110
yeah no I know the metal alone OC

02:05:05,249 --> 02:05:24,110
compare to go SC Russ right they have

02:05:31,189 --> 02:05:37,050
but no one is the important but they

02:05:34,229 --> 02:05:43,110
have achieved their steps to reduce the

02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:46,079
file size yo I'm sorry yo knock you went

02:05:43,110 --> 02:05:48,590
to style your so you speak I know but I

02:05:46,079 --> 02:05:48,590
mean

02:05:55,020 --> 02:07:44,369
[Laughter]

02:05:58,949 --> 02:07:48,449
I think I can see like processing

02:07:44,369 --> 02:07:53,150
I think rust well is - after the I think

02:07:48,449 --> 02:07:53,150
Emma for now Kings thanks

02:07:55,550 --> 02:09:21,720
[Music]

02:07:57,620 --> 02:09:27,630
yeah yeah good yeah the one is

02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:34,440
benchmarking trading name the know the

02:09:27,630 --> 02:09:46,590
language no princess a cheater but this

02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:51,420
is used to be equal to that one is race

02:09:46,590 --> 02:09:55,710
if you compound Rush 2015 they focus on

02:09:51,420 --> 02:10:10,350
stability 2018 focus on productivity

02:09:55,710 --> 02:10:44,040
I'm not so sure I think they just use a

02:10:10,350 --> 02:10:47,840
long time the Mac OS or the using it one

02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:51,870
is RC and one is yeah AIC

02:10:47,840 --> 02:11:03,600
ref soon no no one is for one is for

02:10:51,870 --> 02:11:04,080
multi-threading no devices I read from

02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:32,100
book

02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:34,230
you know you but it's very pretty much

02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:39,210
easy to clean up because it's message

02:11:34,230 --> 02:11:41,400
possible but because everything

02:11:39,210 --> 02:11:46,380
everything is message passing so it

02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:53,370
creates of course more kabisa because

02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:55,080
that is everything as a message is

02:11:53,370 --> 02:11:58,500
basically that's why you can scale

02:11:55,080 --> 02:12:03,390
easily because they say nothing but a

02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:05,550
lot memory right not so much my java is

02:12:03,390 --> 02:12:06,780
a nothing so everything is like a pass a

02:12:05,550 --> 02:12:10,469
copy of message

02:12:06,780 --> 02:12:13,139
you everything is a copy like I tell you

02:12:10,469 --> 02:12:15,780
to do something instead of I book you to

02:12:13,139 --> 02:12:33,289
do something Oh si si Razvi cloning

02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:36,989
every time I use low memory yep Steve

02:12:33,289 --> 02:12:39,000
it's not my fave is a Python or you know

02:12:36,989 --> 02:13:08,489
what you're doing as long as as long as

02:12:39,000 --> 02:13:21,659
you know what you're doing you see true

02:13:08,489 --> 02:13:49,349
versus no because we come to swap stuff

02:13:21,659 --> 02:13:54,840
for you like state tracking and so

02:13:49,349 --> 02:13:58,829
address so you pay more for us what they

02:13:54,840 --> 02:14:02,630
ask for it they talk about you have a

02:13:58,829 --> 02:14:02,630
server any kind everyone's

02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:10,419
[Music]

02:14:15,390 --> 02:14:21,060
[Laughter]

02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:34,390
there's no benefit of using this curve

02:14:32,290 --> 02:14:36,520
language you see but even music go for

02:14:34,390 --> 02:14:38,350
lambda it's like stop it already right

02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:40,630
this is like a lot more work for you to

02:14:38,350 --> 02:15:01,720
do yeah you write more code than you

02:14:40,630 --> 02:15:03,550
right normal sorry if you worry about

02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:10,260
Ella issued if you want to get slammed I

02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:12,310
don't worry about it I just use my days

02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:15,160
you've seen the coolant work for

02:15:12,310 --> 02:15:16,780
Columbia it's actually harder to it's

02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:20,650
actually easier to write your own server

02:15:16,780 --> 02:15:25,990
then you write your lambda so yeah no I

02:15:20,650 --> 02:15:26,680
know as you know right guys who are we

02:15:25,990 --> 02:15:28,720
missing

02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:30,730
they use laptop also because lambda

02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:33,790
itself as they are all run time so you

02:15:30,730 --> 02:15:35,470
get you if you and if you use R Us is

02:15:33,790 --> 02:15:36,880
actually not directly you first like

02:15:35,470 --> 02:15:40,510
that

02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:43,210
NEPA SDF an attraction so you cannot get

02:15:40,510 --> 02:15:45,850
just like when you try to run away SMP

02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:48,420
it's not actually just is fast but it's

02:15:45,850 --> 02:15:53,770
not that much faster was all like right

02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:55,260
no smaller are given we are talking

02:15:53,770 --> 02:15:59,370
about fast right now

02:15:55,260 --> 02:16:02,530
and there's still size like size for

02:15:59,370 --> 02:16:08,130
size issue for lambda as long as you can

02:16:02,530 --> 02:16:08,130
ablute in you can run the house well

02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:26,050
yeah I think so people the one of them

02:16:11,950 --> 02:16:28,240
for target some of the popular discrete

02:16:26,050 --> 02:16:35,560
already supports person be so you can

02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:39,760
just put it to SMB how my tips are you

02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:41,740
written know how many cubes are you

02:16:39,760 --> 02:17:01,020
going for a game either they just write

02:16:41,740 --> 02:17:01,020
one type and they carry yeah Java

02:17:06,030 --> 02:17:13,450
you write once deploy every man Ronnie

02:17:10,179 --> 02:17:15,340
we've got that right yeah yeah

02:17:13,450 --> 02:17:19,600
Kevin transferred last time many years

02:17:15,340 --> 02:17:28,060
ago not secured our white dude what do

02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:40,630
you think it's not to kill knows the

02:17:28,060 --> 02:17:43,660
type you just ah you can write in secure

02:17:40,630 --> 02:17:47,110
coding now it's actually because he's

02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:49,270
escaped the browser sandboxing so you

02:17:47,110 --> 02:17:52,000
can access your operating system if you

02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:53,639
if you give it too much probation thank

02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:57,579
you

02:17:53,639 --> 02:17:57,579
[Laughter]

02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:11,530
one thing that you know something that

02:18:09,250 --> 02:18:15,280
we know really sucks about SM please so

02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:17,230
we can you can escape the kind of the

02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:20,620
front end limitation like if he wants to

02:18:17,230 --> 02:18:23,050
GI pcs because this use you can just use

02:18:20,620 --> 02:19:09,070
message a plea to do it because the

02:18:23,050 --> 02:19:18,840
JavaScript you know you can write D

02:19:09,070 --> 02:19:18,840
yourself right it's a special you can

02:19:18,899 --> 02:19:27,609
yeah see look everything so easily it is

02:19:23,979 --> 02:19:32,199
the least your cook that they dice that

02:19:27,609 --> 02:19:46,529
could as well yeah

02:19:32,199 --> 02:19:54,869
Lisa bring [ __ ] no leaks

02:19:46,529 --> 02:19:59,770
yes theta theta can be function yeah

02:19:54,869 --> 02:20:06,369
yeah no I mean just for for you

02:19:59,770 --> 02:20:08,739
everything is V ice as a function your

02:20:06,369 --> 02:20:13,539
data can be a function your fancy can be

02:20:08,739 --> 02:20:17,709
a data your data can be a budget that

02:20:13,539 --> 02:20:20,399
runs your data as you pass you the book

02:20:17,709 --> 02:20:23,699
they I costume and you it'll Crispo

02:20:20,399 --> 02:20:23,699
little schemer

02:20:27,189 --> 02:20:58,119
that's I see the crystal it's a crisp

02:20:29,279 --> 02:21:12,270
scheme scheme is an easy exercise yes

02:20:58,119 --> 02:21:12,270
could but it's good

02:21:14,160 --> 02:22:14,400
Oh JA effects I don't I do and it's a

02:22:13,050 --> 02:22:16,830
very good exercise you have to memorize

02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:21,271
everything then the autocomplete I like

02:22:16,830 --> 02:22:24,150
my autocomplete it's not like this idea

02:22:21,271 --> 02:23:15,061
could generate everything for you if you

02:22:24,150 --> 02:23:18,021
want now mounting one of the configure

02:23:15,061 --> 02:23:18,021
your no-brainer

02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:33,920
[Laughter]

02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:54,600
[Laughter]

02:23:57,380 --> 02:24:00,470
[Music]

02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:54,721
[Laughter]

02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:58,051
no no no keep an eye ma use combination

02:24:54,721 --> 02:25:00,150
key so this sort of system is also

02:24:58,051 --> 02:25:02,670
combination so you cannot use outside of

02:25:00,150 --> 02:25:04,710
you cannot do the key binding exactly on

02:25:02,670 --> 02:25:09,980
the SQLite because you crash with the

02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:09,980
system so you cannot do just now

02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:21,510
I cannot do all this in emacs Oslo to
