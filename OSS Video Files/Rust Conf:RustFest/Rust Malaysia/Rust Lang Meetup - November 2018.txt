00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,819
[Music]

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:43,310
later on I tip very quick to it so this

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:46,730
is how it looks like right now I think

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:50,389
it's easier to interpret but just

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:53,050
another way to write this assumption or

00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,050
this puzzle

00:05:53,509 --> 00:06:00,090
all right yes it really depends on what

00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:03,870
kind of programming paradigm that you

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:07,189
are into so as long as it works it

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,189
really doesn't really matter

00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,810
so the next one is saddle point saddle

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:21,270
point is finding a point in the matrix

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:23,910
where all the entry itself is the

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:28,100
greatest between all the elements in the

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:33,290
rows but it tastes the smallest within

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,290
the cell the columns

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,000
so

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,270
you

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,270
it

00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:56,350
not really

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:59,980
mathematics here so in this case we are

00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:02,610
looking for something like

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,610
this

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,599
one

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:18,130
because then all the edges in the row

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:22,170
and then swallows within those column

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,170
so this is

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:30,930
what I submitted in the beginning it's

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:34,380
very very elaborated and a lot of these

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:40,710
can be done like if a single call

00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:44,040
instead of doing manual coding so this

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:48,500
is what happens when submit a very bad

00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,500
code and get nagged a lot

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,320
it's very much like real life in a book

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:11,220
so that's a lot of discussions going on

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:16,470
so I was told about for instance how

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:21,919
flat map can be used to simplify the sum

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:26,849
of my code by camber here a filter of

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:30,120
the map which is usually can be

00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:33,570
simplified with a flat map

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,339
so in the end chocolate in the end the

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:50,550
whole thing looks like this is a lot

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:59,300
shorter this is vector R yep keep

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:59,300
located so if I talk like this

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:15,100
because if the only way you can

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:18,070
manipulate a mess of things that we

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,260
don't see we know they nestle already or

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,940
whatever but if you have a list of

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,910
things that you want to manipulate you

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,420
want to add in entries to the list the

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:34,440
best way to do it is by vector because

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:39,120
array is immutable by default so it's

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,120
station since I

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:56,740
I don't see anything I don't see

00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:00,210
anything driven on our back I have not

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,210
been actively looking for it now

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:06,630
not too sure whether they have a number

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,260
equivalent there but even if they're

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,970
happy there

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:15,270
I suppose it's another link up to I find

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:18,750
that because everything is immutable by

00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:22,160
default and then changing cell requires

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,160
a lot of reference

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,750
not to fill pala what I know is is lazy

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:44,020
so if you really want the result you

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:46,240
have to go call collect otherwise it you

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,930
won't get a result and if you don't

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,960
collect your result you have lifetime

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:56,500
problem when it comes to when you need

00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,280
to use it later because if you don't

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:03,660
collect it it will be

00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:06,830
drop then when when you want to use it

00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,830
then it's not there anymore

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:25,030
not really calling small I compute will

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:28,290
compute the result to eval in value with

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,290
the lazy statement

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,200
so the next one is this I don't have

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:43,350
read this book

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:47,610
no yes so it's a number number

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:50,190
validation things or given a list of

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,440
digits so you start from the last digit

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:56,880
then you double every odd index digit

00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:00,450
from contain from the back then sum up

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,940
the resulting list of digits and as well

00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:08,670
as the rest of the even index digits so

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:11,700
number obtains to be 3/10 so usually

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,550
this kind of validation is done to

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,240
credit card numbers so that's why the

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:20,449
chief there

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:24,759
so that's not going much very much to

00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,759
talk about here just a very

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:46,500
split in two and

00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:46,500
array of digits bondage

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,980
you

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,570
yeah is given in strength so you need to

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:10,030
convert into digits you can break up

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:14,760
break it up into individual digits this

00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:17,800
is why this is actually what happens in

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,310
that's what what that's the problem that

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,670
I was facing so there was a extensive

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:27,510
discussion on how to do this without

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,510
clothing

00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:47,649
operating has a problem where sometimes

00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:49,990
you move you attempt to move the value

00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:53,009
away so if you happen to move the value

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:57,189
away then you are modifying the original

00:13:53,009 --> 00:14:05,160
ring then this is not permitted then you

00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:05,160
can address sometimes it's not that easy

00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:12,519
which is what I settle with a clone back

00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:18,600
then so this is what you need to write

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:21,879
you the one cloner yeah whenever you to

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,439
let's say Simon assign the value to

00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:28,569
something something else and you'll be

00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:44,290
booked in any one time a value can be

00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:48,309
only owned by one person the scalars are

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:56,290
usually copyable we can copy the scalars

00:14:48,309 --> 00:15:00,220
but not things like a vector anything

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:02,279
that is on the spot on the hip is not

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,730
happy about you need to explicitly

00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:13,839
cloning so a lot of times in the

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:15,970
beginning also in the beginning yes you

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,790
get really frustrated like dealing with

00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:21,370
all the copy and the clone thing so in

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,889
the beginning usually in if you want to

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,160
avoid other compiler errors the code

00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,160
everything

00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:33,899
but sooner or later as time goes on then

00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:37,620
whenever the compiler shows you our

00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:40,350
problem on our own commercial internet

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,800
you kind of feel some kind of intuition

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,640
on how to really solve it I can't really

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,160
tell you

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:53,490
and every time like why it happens but

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,240
and this like at the current stage I can

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,600
like oh I know this may be a ownership

00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,600
problem

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:07,670
like let them lengthening the time it

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:36,530
leaves a probably solve the problem but

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:38,690
I cannot believe because because yes I

00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:49,280
did this according to the original

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:52,910
instructions a michigan digit reverse

00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:59,120
the string then you do all the review

00:16:52,910 --> 00:17:05,480
due to the operation to the order up our

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:09,260
index digital yeah but in the end you

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,830
need to sum everything together so you

00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:18,680
will need to the tablet will only double

00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:26,540
the numbers yes but in the annual is

00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:30,650
some everything together yes I know that

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:34,490
I know that but then you need to apply

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:38,090
the double operation on the every second

00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:40,450
a very basic and attractor and then in

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:44,660
the end you need to add all the second

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:49,010
double numbers and then the non double

00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:54,020
numbers together if you want to do it in

00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:57,070
one goal this is what you do so you

00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:01,940
remember eight and you will need about

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:04,600
special ones then in the end you sum up

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,600
everything together

00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:11,540
is an easy problem let's not spend too

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,650
much remodeling so the max is a batch

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:19,180
cipher also is a very boring cipher

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:22,270
which practically

00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:27,400
you put the first letter into the last

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:46,150
letter A to Z then B Y C to acts as a

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:48,090
trance or also boxes sorry I don't

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,090
remember much about CNA

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,090
so

00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,690
so if you if you think again then

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,310
ciphering and deciphering is writing the

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:07,800
same process just that the only

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:12,390
additional requirement is that you break

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:15,990
the cipher text in so you add a space

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:18,960
after every 5th character I think yeah

00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,620
that's that's what is required in the

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,620
unit has

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:29,940
so speaking of unicast

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:35,090
they actually have a very extensive unit

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,090
as for all the cases so

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:42,220
so in this case you have a clear tax and

00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:44,670
no ciphertext needs to have a space for

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:50,670
every five practice

00:19:44,670 --> 00:20:04,710
so being someone who abuse language law

00:19:50,670 --> 00:20:09,030
so this is my attempt to break so I was

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:13,320
trying to throw in a closure or closure

00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:17,730
or anonymous anonymous function so that

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:22,350
I see whether it can be done quickly

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:25,100
it's a proof of concept so is likely the

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,100
same thing right

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:38,130
this is function to add a space for

00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:38,130
every fifth character and then when you

00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:45,910
sorry

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:50,730
oh this one - one - number you a is the

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:55,980
data type so I won this one night in

00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,980
ensign ATPG pick teacher

00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:13,890
yes it's a character it yeah I'm going

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,890
to try to execute about I don't know why

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,920
this is for space

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:34,470
almost is already a ballpark number

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:34,470
I mean member 65 is 18 at all

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
remember

00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:12,400
November is one of them is one of the

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,400
crackers

00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,190
like the folks like goal an apology this

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,780
will include you the leading public

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,090
service but Michael Michael Michael

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,930
right invisible which is not the Left

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,930
Front an analyst

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:41,100
so this is what happens when you have a

00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:44,100
very extensive or very helpful mentor

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,549
who tells you a lot of things when you

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,549
break things

00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:52,719
because I was new

00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:09,160
this is what learning is because I was

00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:13,330
experimenting with how to break the

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:17,500
language so this is practically how I

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:19,879
learn so I break things then I figure

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,749
out how to fix it

00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:28,059
this is one of the problems that I spend

00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:28,059
a lot of time fixing my own problems

00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,090
okay

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:58,560
I'm just cool different methods of doing

00:23:43,320 --> 00:24:05,910
the same thing no I'm not too interested

00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:07,980
in the performance I don't know it

00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:18,990
passes the unit has that's what it

00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:23,480
matters I don't care as long as it

00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,480
passes the unit has I I'm happy enough

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,980
this is

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:51,970
if ya on the Conn captain are if you

00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,630
really want an answer about contacting

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:57,580
my I use concat it is because in Rus

00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:01,630
everything a lot of the mutation happens

00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:06,780
in place so but I wanted to emulate

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:10,300
people of other languages like Lisp

00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:12,960
where they return a new thing when you

00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,960
mutate them

00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:22,780
so that was why I use a lot of concat in

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:24,490
my earlier code but in dealing with

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,000
mutation is something that you have to

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:50,230
get used to in Russell because otherwise

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:51,880
you are alright a very horrible so the

00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:57,510
reason why I talk about

00:25:51,880 --> 00:26:00,700
concat yourself so because a concat is

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:04,360
practically I told one side effects will

00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:08,920
happen so I want a new copy of things

00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:11,440
when within happens so if I really want

00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,800
that to happen in Russ then I need to

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,400
write a lot of code to do that a lot of

00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:23,340
concat a lot of cloning love this and

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:30,400
that so in this one is practically

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:32,560
parentheses matching exercise just

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,570
matching whether whether the given

00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:41,890
string has matching parentheses by

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:45,810
fetching again no you need in has will

00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:48,970
be in order also it has to be in order

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:51,690
let's wet our that's actually in the way

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,690
for you to cheat

00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:01,760
yep different packets different order

00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:06,800
whether they are they are balanced

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:14,000
whether they are not balanced yep stack

00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:16,220
manipulation so in this one I usually I

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,380
do a lot of concat I do a lot of con

00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:25,270
cats in the beginning until my mentor

00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:29,570
told me about a library called op eds

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:32,540
which basically emulates what leaves

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:34,600
this does

00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,600
you

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,770
sorry

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:49,620
now this is what I submitted at the end

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,750
that's not really nicely written if I

00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:56,490
write it today it looks envelope

00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:58,600
different but guess what Donna gets all

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:03,150
the unit has passes

00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,150
I'm not too picky about quality

00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:13,659
so this time to match all the matching

00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:13,659
conditions

00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,580
so this is a library I was told about

00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,440
Oh

00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,860
you

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:50,760
string is mutable string is movable file

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:58,440
yeah just a small string is a reference

00:28:50,760 --> 00:29:00,770
list ring it's very much like slice and

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,770
array

00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:11,470
and what to talk about so it's just that

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:13,720
strip all the alphabets away when you

00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:16,210
need deal with the brackets and you'll

00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:21,690
be a lot easier to your work

00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:21,690
so this is what I was called to order

00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:31,690
mutation results in a new thing that's

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,720
what what happens in other languages are

00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:38,740
for instance in Python new instance for

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,720
every mutation but it has a little bit

00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:47,020
of performance Hitler if you really use

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:50,770
it so in the end can the moral of the

00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:53,310
story is get used to how rust repeats

00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,310
things

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,580
they don't in this library

00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,040
from what I see is they don't clone

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:08,630
clone everything they built a tree

00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:14,090
instead of cloning everything so so you

00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:15,950
if you have like a list of things then

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:18,770
you add one to the thing then they give

00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:24,810
a new training or new tree branch for

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:27,610
only the new things you don't go

00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:30,850
so dependable you are building a tree

00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:34,000
and so whatever that do one proper tree

00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:36,580
is by chasing from the branch by the

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:43,930
leaf and they review the whole thing for

00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:46,620
you is really it's not about balancing

00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,620
is just tree

00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:05,509
so sub-list is and is a case where I

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:08,480
discover a lot of new functions that are

00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:09,080
very much an improvement to the quality

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,909
of life

00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:16,639
so in short one in short description is

00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:19,489
sub-list is by comparing towards a long

00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:20,529
one and a short one then you see whether

00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:24,070
one is

00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:24,070
sublease of nada

00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,310
you

00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,030
you

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:46,970
not really is more like new a string it

00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:52,509
can be equal it can be not equal a sub

00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:57,200
lives also police each other so usually

00:31:52,509 --> 00:32:03,139
what people do is compute three you do a

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:06,700
lot of the index manipulation so subset

00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:09,619
of this right you shift the index around

00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:13,779
you shift index around to find whether

00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:13,779
you see whether it has a match

00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:41,809
ah unicode character will be discussed

00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:46,400
later it's a pain into dealing with in

00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:49,309
and Russ so yeah I was told about

00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,050
windows the windows method so

00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:53,840
practically it that means I don't need

00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:56,960
to do all the index manipulation no need

00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,110
to do calculation by where it starts

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:08,450
when it ends things that just need a

00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:11,670
call in those no luckily you need want

00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:14,850
to read a subset of screen

00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:18,930
so this long piece of code becomes

00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:23,430
something bhishan because I don't need

00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:30,830
to do it much code to do the index

00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:36,150
manipulation is a method in Rus strength

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:39,390
Center library it's just save you from

00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:42,450
doing other index manipulation so for

00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:48,600
instance if you want to look for a

00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:51,110
subset of string like a foot we don't

00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,110
scroll in

00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:10,339
no I'm not doing a traitor here I don't

00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:12,399
need an iterator here

00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,399
you

00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:20,700
because I only one to read okay let me

00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:20,700
open up the code

00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,940
you

00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,490
or imagine lunch at lunch lunch

00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:47,290
the ambulance one I needed is only

00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:53,080
break this somehow prick the string into

00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:56,679
a list of things that is this long this

00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:59,290
one is at this length so it gives you an

00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,430
iterator I don't really care about what

00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:06,030
it contains

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:06,030
but I only want to know any of them is

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:28,900
yes let me know it's like we know

00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:37,380
this is let me know which is why useless

00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:06,430
it's a nice quality of life thing but

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:13,810
there's a lot of discount function

00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:16,870
inside the sender every oh that's the

00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:19,300
anonymous function is very much like

00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:23,200
arrow function in JavaScript fully just

00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:34,120
different syntax this is the parameter

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:35,630
this is this expression is very very

00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,210
nice

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:41,660
there are a lot of quality of life kind

00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:44,450
of method in the ring the only problem

00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,730
is that you don't actually expected

00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:50,330
discount things so you don't actively

00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:56,200
look for them unless you read the whole

00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:56,200
thing whenever you like Google

00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:02,780
there's a lot of quality of lighting in

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:06,990
the standard wheel that's why I can tell

00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:09,480
so the next one is a lot more

00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:12,300
complicated it's not hard

00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,359
is this a lot of work because you need

00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,670
to score poke the hand and we need to be

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:24,369
able to score it and then you need to be

00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:26,430
able to compare so this one

00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:26,430
you

00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,140
on this show

00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,860
you

00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,280
you

00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,690
you

00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,290
you

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:26,299
there's a long way to to do with ena but

00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:27,890
the star polyfoam of life thing that is

00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:30,529
something that you don't really expect

00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,569
from a lot of languages so the problem

00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:36,969
with that is you don't really actively

00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:48,650
look for them in the documentation so

00:38:36,969 --> 00:39:12,380
unless you that will be useful on so

00:38:48,650 --> 00:39:15,710
Nexus pukka focus about scoring yeah

00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:24,890
yeah because again happens to share the

00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:27,259
name so but usually all the documents

00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:32,979
are all centralized in one place so one

00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:36,979
shouldn't be a problem okay in way is

00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:40,130
it's not hard this is a lot of work yes

00:39:36,979 --> 00:39:42,849
I need to score in the compare then you

00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,849
need to model

00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:52,060
so a lot of code is spent on modeling

00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:56,140
and then a lot of code is spent on like

00:39:52,060 --> 00:40:01,530
scoring calculating it's not complicated

00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:05,310
it's just a lot of work so my mentor

00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:09,220
Bellini is not being interested in the

00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:14,230
problem actually so as long as it passes

00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:17,050
everyone is happy so this is the the

00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:19,690
model then I add aa plan I'm not sure

00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:23,400
how other people does it so it's

00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:26,500
practically just type of hand and

00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,180
whether it is a tree of all kind what's

00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:35,580
value

00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:37,990
what does it's a list it's a vector

00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,360
because I couldn't I couldn't make this

00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:47,380
into a number it's just too large it's a

00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:49,810
17 dimensional array so if I am to turn

00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:52,410
this into number I don't have the condom

00:40:49,810 --> 00:41:01,500
is too big to be model

00:40:52,410 --> 00:41:03,480
so I can become comparing so this is how

00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:06,930
you depend on how you model them that's

00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:18,000
all the type of hand is usually is good

00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:19,920
enough to be familiar in all cases water

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,740
flush then you can a higher number here

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,900
that may be a straight can so number so

00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:28,759
if these two is compared together the

00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,759
Royal Flush room you've been

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,789
it's just a very troublesome problem

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:55,510
it's not clean fun

00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:59,819
it is a very troublesome problem it's

00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:59,819
not actually fun it's just troublesome

00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,840
so is not it's not a determining factor

00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:26,290
here so we just need to focus on the

00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:28,840
values now we gone our Alice in the

00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:33,920
exercise a suit it's not a considering

00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:36,600
factor but it's already very like

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:54,390
overwhelming enough just best allowable

00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:58,020
that I should be put into it I'm a

00:42:54,390 --> 00:43:01,050
Graham come so I do a lot of searching

00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:05,130
at work so anagram to me is just like an

00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:09,030
indexing document problem so I ask where

00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:10,830
it assumed a bag of words model so what

00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:13,560
it means is that two documents with the

00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:17,190
same word in different order it has the

00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:21,390
same resulting vector so anagram is also

00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:23,850
the same thing to me so two words as

00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:27,480
long as it has the same set of alphabets

00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:29,610
in different order and it is anagram so

00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,570
these two bubbles are similar to me

00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:35,360
that's also how I

00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:42,500
Atem the problem is not the best

00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:48,370
solution but the solution is one is no

00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:51,200
it's not this is when Unicode comes by

00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:57,200
because they put in love Unicode in the

00:43:51,200 --> 00:44:13,550
unit hands and then if you attempt to

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:18,410
break the string into it just breaks it

00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:20,300
into a character character condom if you

00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,620
want something a rule then you have to

00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:27,920
do it yourself you need to do the

00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:30,110
assembly yourself it's one character one

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,740
can c'mon c'mon c'mon character so

00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:34,790
unicode in some cases they are is a

00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:43,880
combination of couple characters

00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:47,470
together right you get you get rubbish I

00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:55,010
think I can print it out for you

00:44:47,470 --> 00:45:00,790
the cat is very raw so in most cases you

00:44:55,010 --> 00:45:00,790
are advised to use some library to cool

00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,380
you

00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:07,210
Oh

00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,070
you

00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:21,119
you

00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:33,200
now it becomes one two three four five

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:36,900
six characters no you will bring into

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:40,079
Beirut they will attempt to break into a

00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:43,940
character sir but in Rus is a bit more

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,940
or you have to do the assembly yourself

00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:56,400
that's a way there's a way to do it I

00:45:53,460 --> 00:46:00,779
don't remember how I did it is explained

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:03,599
in documentation so I did yeah I did

00:46:00,779 --> 00:46:06,270
what the documentation say sir if you

00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:10,289
want me to explain what the code does I

00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:12,660
am probably don't remember it's just you

00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:16,470
need to reassemble everything together

00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:19,380
so instead of building a vector of

00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:21,990
practice I build a rack of string where

00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:32,849
the string is actually one complete

00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:37,170
unity unicode character you can a very

00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:41,930
raw or character here you need to figure

00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,930
out how to assemble it back into three

00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:53,410
No

00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:53,410
also it it splits it into actual bite

00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:58,029
that's why you get so many of this

00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:30,150
nice nice long dealing with Allah may be

00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:30,150
the main important punish dysfunction

00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,140
you

00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:06,400
in short user library but yeah just

00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:08,640
wanted to see how otherwise is not that

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,640
difficult

00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:19,089
you all somewhat in order to exit a stop

00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:21,670
it's not the most efficient most obvious

00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:29,289
solution but yeah I was trying to learn

00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:32,049
how to deal with strings so the user

00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:37,109
library even in the documentation itself

00:48:32,049 --> 00:48:39,729
is pausing to use a library the final

00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:43,269
you know final I'm sure there's a

00:48:39,729 --> 00:48:51,219
library that does this but I hope not

00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:53,469
I'm tough I'm fine any anything else yes

00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:55,959
but breaking it is a problem itself I

00:48:53,469 --> 00:49:11,559
don't think I think that the core

00:48:55,959 --> 00:49:19,209
developers does not really want to it's

00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:23,920
just number is the same it's just

00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:30,119
different representation you can cause a

00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,119
you a into character

00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:38,530
in short user library and of sorry

00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:46,730
there's no between you need to find a

00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:48,829
crate to do it I think they want to keep

00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:51,099
the core small so that it is easier to

00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:51,099
manage

00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:57,190
it's actually explained in the

00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:58,720
documentation I explained the

00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:08,170
documentation I explained in the

00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:11,500
tutorial book also so so minesweeper is

00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:14,160
also another problem it can be fun in

00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:18,940
the beginning when you want to try it

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:21,720
but this is a story where I abuse option

00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,720
for no good reason

00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:33,579
put in the numbers you are given a grid

00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:36,110
of bumps then you populate the numbers

00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:38,170
to the view

00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,170
you

00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:44,890
no no you just need to put in number

00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:48,880
numbers you're given a grid like this

00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:52,990
then your view in the numbers how many

00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:58,600
bombs in the in your neighborhood app in

00:50:52,990 --> 00:51:11,460
short a very NP game of life finger okay

00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:11,460
write a very short line Python one Wow

00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,580
you

00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:55,210
yeah you insured not News option for

00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:55,210
things that is not an optional value so

00:51:56,859 --> 00:52:03,760
where venue is not exist as I exist or

00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:12,800
or depending on I mean in because you

00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,330
don't only calculate the numbers nursing

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:24,349
to a lot of other things before

00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:27,349
completing so now if I need to calculate

00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:29,450
other stuff so this is how I abuse it

00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:32,630
because I wanted to use something a

00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:34,660
filter and map so this is not something

00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,660
that

00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:50,420
not really that's my preferred way of

00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:53,150
doing things which is why again neck on

00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:56,950
the ocean on you should not be abusing

00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:56,950
that please don't do that

00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:07,700
so it's out that you should do a proper

00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:07,700
loop and proper whatever that gets a job

00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:15,310
from those two key things I don't know I

00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,310
don't remember

00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:23,950
luckily what I did was I look through

00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:25,870
all the crate and then I calculate the

00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,820
neighborhood whether there's a bomb or

00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:30,790
not at all

00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:32,530
so filtering works originally there

00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:38,500
because I didn't know that's this

00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:40,330
saturating sub when you have unsigned

00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:43,990
integer if you don't want to

00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:48,490
accidentally make it into a negative

00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:51,220
number you use this as a bound chain so

00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:53,530
it will return a result whether it is if

00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:56,080
it's not a number and you will not

00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:59,020
proceed if it's a number that will

00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:01,570
possibly flatmap filter things a net

00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:04,210
there's also another quality of life

00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:07,980
thing that so it stops you from doing

00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,980
stupid things with unsigned integers

00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,710
you

00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:20,040
so this is the first concurrency problem

00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:23,400
not sure why I never get this to work

00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,410
properly on my computer okay because I

00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,090
have a lot of slack and then Paco

00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:31,950
running all the time zone

00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:34,400
I don't know everything looks the same

00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:36,170
to me right they run at the same speed

00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,640
to me

00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:41,510
parallel sequential they run are roughly

00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,510
the same to me

00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:51,010
so big but then I will always I was told

00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:56,140
if it's a lot faster in parallel my code

00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:59,890
in other computer right yeah you can

00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:04,660
exist in to submit your cargo bubble

00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:07,000
together with a call now I want to try

00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:09,270
to avoid using my read when I learn

00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,270
things

00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:17,369
it's very much like co-channel isn't it

00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:34,890
yes sorry yes it is but this is an

00:55:30,489 --> 00:55:34,890
exercise to teach you all do currency

00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:48,249
it's an exercise the only correct

00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:52,950
frequency that the frequency letter this

00:55:48,249 --> 00:55:55,390
time you don't need to do with the

00:55:52,950 --> 00:56:07,410
Unicode as much are you can just assume

00:55:55,390 --> 00:56:07,410
everything is Askia sorry because our

00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:49,190
okay this is a preferred way according

00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:51,920
the documentation but I'm not sure what

00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:55,069
happens up buddy runs normally in other

00:56:51,920 --> 00:57:09,470
computers and it's a lot faster in other

00:56:55,069 --> 00:57:12,400
computers not my computer so almost

00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:12,400
three seconds whatever

00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:22,240
I think they multiplied it a lot

00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,240
you

00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,850
what

00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:40,520
or the the sequential trend is not done

00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:42,810
by me are there's information than

00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:45,120
implementation done in the unit s itself

00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:50,000
so I will need benchmark in only

00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:50,000
benchmark against my implementation here

00:57:52,340 --> 00:58:00,240
the normal one the normal one should be

00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:05,340
I don't know it's the same code test and

00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:07,950
different computer no I don't define the

00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:14,220
chat is like in gold is very much like

00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:32,400
what gold does yes I don't know and I

00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:35,599
don't care I'm very computer

00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,599
[Music]

00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:48,320
one prep for each into trunk because

00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:51,170
that is because we gather by with it

00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:54,940
this is the roof access

00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:54,940
some-something's Lima

00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:01,039
whatever tennis faster in his machine I

00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:05,119
don't know what he how he can because

00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:07,309
his machine so different architecture

00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:13,910
different machine whatever different

00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:29,890
environments all not something like have

00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:29,890
a lot of Islamic sports and espavo

00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,430
on this home

00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,240
oh so this is how a threat is born

01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:05,800
luckily perfectly here

01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:22,760
this is calculating this is summing the

01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:27,280
result so many where it's already spawn

01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:27,280
in one trap for each chunk is a for each

01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:41,969
but then why do you want to put in so

01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:46,859
much time in solving a problem no why is

01:00:41,969 --> 01:00:49,410
it a bottleneck it's not a problem there

01:00:46,859 --> 01:00:51,989
are always behind ready for you so yeah

01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:55,999
I stopped it's not a problem for you to

01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:55,999
over architect the thing

01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:30,400
is the reduced pot is one track the main

01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:36,540
track when you sum everything up

01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:36,540
together in here 34 to 41

01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:43,500
you know you should the past exists not

01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,680
pass on that machine that's all it

01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:48,619
should be pasta

01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:53,660
so the last one is interpreter for this

01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:56,990
mini language so there are reload we

01:01:53,660 --> 01:02:00,410
wrote a couple times yes yes a lot of

01:01:56,990 --> 01:02:05,260
references a lot of mutation it gets

01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:10,329
very hairy and you have a lot of this so

01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:10,329
it's not really fun to really so

01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:17,779
practically what it does is a new

01:02:13,339 --> 01:02:19,940
tokenized thing into rust objects then

01:02:17,779 --> 01:02:22,760
you believe evaluate from the left right

01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:24,780
that's all nothing too fancy is

01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:29,820
happening here

01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:32,430
so this is the latest version this 12

01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:37,280
revision I think this is the most I've

01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:40,290
done for any of the exercise so far so

01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:45,990
sorry I see which where's our reference

01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:49,080
counting opens counter so in some cases

01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:51,450
where you there are certain things that

01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:54,000
you cannot clone then if you relieved

01:02:51,450 --> 01:03:03,810
once it will be clone then you can use

01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:07,080
hacia our pointer where it's a sharing

01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:23,490
of a pointer just call the point instead

01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:25,170
of the thing itself really funny so a

01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:30,260
very simple language from what I can

01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:50,940
tell but it's a very nice Oh reverse us

01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:54,920
we made it a PN first polish notation so

01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,920
this is what happens ah

01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:13,060
so this is what happens if you want to

01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:15,280
submit a different crate into solution

01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:18,280
so in this case I don't use an extra

01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:26,670
cream but I use a newer addition of

01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:28,090
brass so I need to submit on patent oh I

01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:30,850
don't know

01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:34,360
so when you submit the configuration up

01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:38,650
so then the mentor can have the same

01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:40,800
configuration as I I have to run the

01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:40,800
code

01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:50,080
I draw I think it just makes life easier

01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:52,590
when you have things like in poll

01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,590
keyword

01:04:52,690 --> 01:05:02,140
thing and then also the lifetime is a

01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:05,710
slight slight revision to the time like

01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:08,410
chromosome so that's why my mentor was

01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:12,150
having problem if he compiles the code

01:05:08,410 --> 01:05:12,150
in the inner engine

01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:20,880
and I was new in the evening I'm not

01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:25,010
sure whether I use that just that it

01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,010
doesn't compile in the earlier edition

01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:32,480
so nothing much to talk about this is

01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:34,580
where all the meanings are given to the

01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:38,270
operators

01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:43,970
so practically new anonymous function is

01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:46,970
assigned to operators to the word the

01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:50,500
call function as well so they have

01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:54,380
different behaviors and you can also

01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:57,230
create your own word as also what is

01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:59,930
covered in the unit as and when you

01:05:57,230 --> 01:06:06,200
tokenize you give the meaning some of

01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:09,460
them is anonymous function some of them

01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,460
are numbers

01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,640
this is a hash table I use a hash table

01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,640
tool

01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,580
you

01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:45,360
practically that's all I really want to

01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:45,360
talk about

01:06:56,630 --> 01:07:00,370
I mean

01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:18,500
well it's a system-level language so I

01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:22,000
aspire to be faster just like how I

01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:22,000
expect : to be pass

01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:51,960
so that's all I want to talk about in

01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:51,960
the rest Kolkata and in question

01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:19,560
yeah we need to fight with the borrowed

01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:23,410
tracker a lot then you somehow you bill

01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:26,609
we call it a reflex action or whatever

01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:32,410
so you kind of know how to fix a problem

01:08:26,609 --> 01:08:35,020
but you cannot really explain why it's

01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:43,089
like you built some crap intuition to

01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:47,049
the problem like exploring the planet

01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:49,230
just a deal you somehow find a way to

01:08:47,049 --> 01:08:49,230
lie

01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:05,210
that's all me blah

01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:43,040
we will do mine in a model we want to

01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:46,600
try working for us without this we have

01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,600
three grounders

01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:56,500
if you don't get your life thank you

01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,810
you

01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:54,949
you

01:11:52,889 --> 01:11:54,949
you

01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:14,790
you

01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:17,070
you

01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:44,590
Oh

01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:25,450
you

01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:51,840
we live beyond awesome I can write this

01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:51,840
is another thing but is

01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:10,800
CC 99 bottles of beer on the wall 99

01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:11,250
bottles of you take one down and pass it

01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:18,740
around

01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:18,740
99 8 98 bottles of beer on the wall okay

01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:36,360
echo now I called yesterday or I call

01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:45,770
yesterday on this one I got you a new

01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:45,770
code now movie is anyone crying okay

01:14:50,120 --> 01:15:00,570
when the Paula oh you water

01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:15,050
we're we're okay we're okay okay yes yes

01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:38,880
the Magna Pope done see but okay we were

01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:43,910
I do yesterday ID yesterday I I cannot

01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,910
see is the I can also doing like one

01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:48,410
here our bodies are here to be ie

01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:54,410
there you I can see

01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:18,809
see man wins by how you do how you do

01:16:11,639 --> 01:16:21,960
this another ID your event of people

01:16:18,809 --> 01:16:26,429
just rapaciously ok this is the fastest

01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:43,530
way to do well because you're I'm

01:16:26,429 --> 01:16:46,320
talking same same okay okay this what I

01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:46,650
did anything basically are also cheating

01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,499
us

01:16:46,650 --> 01:17:02,909
I used to look unrolling if I know

01:16:49,499 --> 01:17:05,809
checking the version I did okay what

01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:05,809
what idea

01:17:07,639 --> 01:17:18,909
at first I just yummy to type look good

01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:18,909
I guess yeah if you think your ass okay

01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:31,369
yeah it's called better so basically why

01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:34,809
that is this no did wonders over I know

01:17:31,369 --> 01:17:37,909
but this is the first thing that right I

01:17:34,809 --> 01:17:45,559
know I know we see this thing doesn't

01:17:37,909 --> 01:17:47,989
bastard I know this and example did not

01:17:45,559 --> 01:17:52,010
say oh okay I guess I should have a

01:17:47,989 --> 01:17:58,070
washer definitely bicycle okay so this

01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:59,630
Isis hadn't come to move so by nicest

01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:04,099
I'm going through okay

01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:08,840
I mean that means Syria is the mother of

01:18:04,099 --> 01:18:15,789
the first yeah

01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:15,789
did I say I see you idiot a no not milk

01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:23,119
by shaving question okay these are the

01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:29,360
first thing that I ride nice at the end

01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:37,099
time this is so hard you go to the next

01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:41,269
branch with a surface say first whisper

01:18:37,099 --> 01:18:50,269
yes photo Caetano rasa Iona Arianna rod

01:18:41,269 --> 01:18:51,889
okay this is our simple plan awesome

01:18:50,269 --> 01:18:54,889
check out check out the next week washer

01:18:51,889 --> 01:18:55,550
now we all know initial Cara I just I

01:18:54,889 --> 01:19:03,459
don't know change

01:18:55,550 --> 01:19:03,459
yeah the neck and you go by one by wanna

01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:11,709
okay they after this

01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:25,390
and then get this ocean no no because

01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:25,390
this you know why okay sure why

01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:36,320
okay when I do this okay by the way a

01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:39,100
PIPA tip you know this one I'm running

01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,100
carbonelli

01:19:41,369 --> 01:19:46,869
you need the might be bushes to be able

01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:49,599
to one go no no no just

01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:50,349
disobeying but I'm just showing how I do

01:19:49,599 --> 01:19:52,329
last night

01:19:50,349 --> 01:19:58,840
this is one kippa no no you can just

01:19:52,329 --> 01:20:01,780
explore my need to dispel just it

01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:03,579
no that's motivate - all right nany for

01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:08,679
Kampala this is one of the way that I

01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:13,510
find usually this one of the way that's

01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:18,939
a long way 22m are memorable one is used

01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:24,010
cargo Miley run this you run an ID yeah

01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:30,599
I ran one if you trust the memorable

01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:34,769
something so this is a key brother yeah

01:20:30,599 --> 01:20:38,729
you know why find anything okay

01:20:34,769 --> 01:20:38,729
you guys could be told me

01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:42,590
but how come

01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:47,070
yeah

01:20:54,159 --> 01:21:05,619
I know okay

01:21:01,929 --> 01:21:06,130
so creepy shows me repent it we've been

01:21:05,619 --> 01:21:10,780
Ellen

01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:13,689
so this VP something that but rest use

01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:16,239
this it checks your code and you mean

01:21:13,689 --> 01:21:20,189
for you not not just basically thing

01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:20,189
they also shows your performance issues

01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:26,130
yeah bye

01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:30,680
no they're for love recipe their

01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:32,300
philosophy magic one oh there are also

01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:36,739
didn't know this and I checked all

01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:39,340
finally officials without me oh my not

01:21:36,739 --> 01:21:39,340
some languages

01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:53,730
I think you maybe do possess you if you

01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:53,730
do clearly some of you again

01:21:56,099 --> 01:22:11,290
yellow means it warning one in their

01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:12,610
past great error this discolor now the

01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:24,369
blue things over where your food is

01:22:12,610 --> 01:22:27,010
honest I don't know there's no color

01:22:24,369 --> 01:22:28,690
option you know like last year I there

01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:30,280
are a lot of deaf quite no color

01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:32,020
something some new wearables they're

01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:34,989
called Oh color hope people do one color

01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:36,250
that just enabled by this very useful

01:22:34,989 --> 01:22:38,580
because they will show you which line

01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:41,199
like nine line number that one can see

01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:42,760
this this thing this arrows were used to

01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:45,040
when sometimes you have lifetime issue

01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:47,500
that your point out where is the last

01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:50,650
time you should issue where is a way to

01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:53,139
wear but gotta know if point out where

01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:55,719
another over sometimes the lifetime is

01:22:53,139 --> 01:23:02,500
invisible so they are point out where

01:22:55,719 --> 01:23:06,060
the lifetime drop yes or no we are

01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:06,060
caused by before in the unit

01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:25,660
yeah there's a rustling whistle now

01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:28,060
there are quite good support for gears

01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:28,530
course not not not that good stuff of a

01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:31,150
whim

01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:36,430
what is pergola but then they don't have

01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:51,670
everything like Wi-Fi behind the easiest

01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:56,980
yes we must hurry haha bike

01:23:51,670 --> 01:24:00,310
but okay okay this banner idea copy

01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:04,650
ready this is in a give you pause if you

01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:04,650
won okay

01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:17,820
ah yes everyone should have some changes

01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:24,520
oh okay so this because it speaks the

01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:27,100
this please correct okay here I explain

01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:29,830
to this what why didn't you hear is I

01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:31,199
mashed the thing and I give the end

01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:33,840
bottle

01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:36,239
so here I will just pin the end motto

01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,100
here the pain you know this I just spin

01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:41,490
and bottle

01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:44,460
a 3d scan between two fat little show so

01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:53,090
what you can do is white white wine is

01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:53,090
shown here and hundred

01:25:07,179 --> 01:25:10,820
No

01:25:08,389 --> 01:25:12,920
you know why I need this because at

01:25:10,820 --> 01:25:15,199
first I just put I just put it I don't

01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:22,480
have a better spring form and then

01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:22,480
because it fails because this is spring

01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:31,960
not just creepy roughly fill because

01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:42,889
white is creepy this so telling you why

01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:45,520
this goes on the four men both is

01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:48,469
different for men

01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:50,830
yeah this one something I face even

01:25:48,469 --> 01:25:56,360
though I know this video I feel a sneeze

01:25:50,830 --> 01:26:02,469
see okay yeah yeah this is where you get

01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:10,250
X back to stir pound structuring this is

01:26:02,469 --> 01:26:12,280
so this is string Easter people can buy

01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:15,050
graph here error okay I'll show you

01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:19,150
also I so Dedes actually I think how

01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:19,150
come I lady to write a string from right

01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:21,350
you

01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:33,639
you know that sounds ladies ready I do

01:26:31,749 --> 01:26:38,949
this you know I was so lazy and I do

01:26:33,639 --> 01:26:41,429
this you know it doesn't work no because

01:26:38,949 --> 01:26:41,429
a lifetime

01:26:41,969 --> 01:26:51,059
no I switch that to like this yeah

01:26:59,650 --> 01:27:08,960
no I do this SSD are so I can make the

01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:12,980
string and I return it after Esther but

01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:14,450
then why if you compiler tells you might

01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:17,330
be compiled slightly better to is tiny

01:27:14,450 --> 01:27:22,330
compared here so I mean I'm efficient

01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:22,330
because the very the value

01:27:27,849 --> 01:27:30,599
so thing

01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:39,910
Mindy

01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:18,730
oh no you cannot give up a zero no you

01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:18,730
need to know yeah

01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:19,130
yeah

01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:30,229
no you think

01:29:26,179 --> 01:29:30,229
releasing people or party

01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:39,480
or you format

01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:53,820
yeah why why I prefer 3/4

01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:53,820
I am Telling You one lengthen

01:30:04,449 --> 01:30:06,510
you

01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:12,190
so youthful mental mental ray

01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,340
you

01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:22,720
it means reform it allows the medicine

01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,720
sector format

01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:35,890
ah look the same

01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:39,639
you

01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,580
you

01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:48,130
you

01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:51,640
Oh

01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:05,960
no one muhaha one is Basara

01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:09,739
you

01:31:16,059 --> 01:31:20,489
one time runtime performance at email

01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:20,489
for me

01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:28,440
Tomica modify your cargo a fantasy

01:31:30,859 --> 01:31:32,889
Oh

01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:47,320
you

01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:47,320
yeah so this one is for my friend

01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:50,400
you

01:31:53,680 --> 01:32:01,060
basically why this bill because the SSP

01:31:56,440 --> 01:32:04,050
are fails because this D string the

01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:07,100
ownership and here

01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:07,100
like nobody

01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:11,590
yeah yeah la

01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:21,380
basically this thing by time and here

01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:24,970
but this and bottle needs to be used

01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:24,970
down there too

01:32:28,449 --> 01:32:34,659
you can't change it ID you can change it

01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:37,510
I this is why I magic if there's a rule

01:32:34,659 --> 01:32:40,419
like they use code to define your own

01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:44,939
ative so when our auto-ship when this

01:32:40,419 --> 01:32:44,939
thing is born here I intended

01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,480
you

01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:55,199
I know honey

01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:06,310
no because everything is using free/busy

01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,310
store is offering

01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:14,220
so it's a reference that little

01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:17,180
reference when I reference life I mean

01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:17,180
reference

01:33:27,070 --> 01:33:31,530
is one of the people our people face

01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:31,530
today

01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:51,690
yeah now under the format with all of it

01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:54,480
this one will become the string on the

01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:58,550
macro Thomas Kane identify we become

01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,550
this happy I will become

01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,730
so this is a worker

01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:06,380
borrowing mccabe all week

01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:11,270
you

01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:17,020
you

01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,020
you

01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:27,330
my Acosta ser ser

01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:33,300
go from boy

01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:38,420
and then sometimes he can be IDs

01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:44,450
this ethic

01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:44,450
you

01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:47,770
you

01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,260
you

01:34:55,379 --> 01:34:59,479
okay this one of people papa

01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,389
you

01:35:19,329 --> 01:35:21,389
you

01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:31,620
- basically wiping everything I also

01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:33,110
pick stuff okay this this is a bit

01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:38,750
different

01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:41,320
I have to here now this let I let a dual

01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:41,320
expansion

01:35:41,849 --> 01:35:48,329
make extension Russ the something called

01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:48,329
dacoit

01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:55,080
no this white one no papa

01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,080
you

01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:58,920
by you assigning Kippur

01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:06,219
structuring ID

01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:19,420
Familia so this the first one will be

01:36:13,449 --> 01:36:21,280
the the program visit our unique make

01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:24,760
sure everything the same maximize I got

01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:27,550
some before here when I reduce the

01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:29,830
library he originally when this thing

01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:31,449
right is actually very confusing come

01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:33,650
back he can be somebody can be silent

01:36:31,449 --> 01:36:38,670
ago

01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:39,480
but yeah library that can be used as a

01:36:38,670 --> 01:36:43,730
hashmap

01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:43,730
when I can use it after a week

01:36:45,449 --> 01:36:51,570
like the vector no just fossa but

01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:54,679
usually it will be eating you work there

01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:57,679
just digested people for a brief period

01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:57,679
identify

01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:04,270
you

01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,060
you

01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:17,360
you

01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:25,480
you

01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,220
you

01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:34,400
you

01:37:37,610 --> 01:37:46,820
now this does it have pickup go to for

01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:49,890
bottom or the previous one with an F

01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:52,590
modifying I put this and bottle and I

01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:55,250
merge it into this place one next

01:37:52,590 --> 01:37:55,250
segment and

01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:05,590
you

01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:12,469
yeah

01:38:09,719 --> 01:38:12,469
okay

01:38:16,949 --> 01:38:20,540
the three C's are you like

01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:24,420
No

01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:36,120
yeah yeah I'm gonna kick my butt off

01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:38,630
this nothing no Goddess Adi to get there

01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,630
no water right

01:38:40,210 --> 01:38:42,780
okay

01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:45,360
you

01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:52,110
oh okay this is great you're safe follow

01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:55,560
like why you don't follow

01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:56,160
okay yeah sure is all okay haha okay

01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:59,400
here I follow

01:38:56,160 --> 01:39:03,690
okay follow but I do I don't know how to

01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:05,370
do 100 who's here oh that's right I

01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:07,670
cannot get him agreeing so I need a

01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:07,670
release

01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,820
yeah

01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:17,770
but I didn't go as he was right

01:39:15,710 --> 01:39:17,770
you

01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:25,070
this is looking certified certified

01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:37,349
okay okay I just need a with intercept

01:39:37,499 --> 01:39:45,420
FS f is ice you know Idid 100 to 0 but

01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:45,420
idea way to work by easy

01:39:45,449 --> 01:39:55,670
my ability yeah I know this was a high

01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:55,670
what is this is away because hey

01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,420
you

01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:05,250
another how many rage are they by load

01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:05,250
is the registry

01:40:11,619 --> 01:40:15,110
you

01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:17,170
you

01:40:15,110 --> 01:40:17,170
you

01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:28,370
that is the durability is along the

01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:29,000
river we can sign you can check it on

01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:31,310
the trip

01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,449
if you let it it is your iterator you

01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:34,449
even enjoy yourself

01:40:36,389 --> 01:40:38,449
you

01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:40,880
you

01:40:41,719 --> 01:40:49,070
okay so design a team before last one

01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:51,260
okay divine reason accepted a baguette

01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:53,710
sitting there is look unrolling for

01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:53,710
performance

01:40:53,970 --> 01:41:07,160
okay didi does this I know where their

01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:07,160
design is look unrolling

01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:20,989
yeah I bench mommy bye there's not much

01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:20,989
difference

01:41:21,289 --> 01:41:29,190
no but this the easy first photo are

01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:30,659
lower than compared to just another one

01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:39,030
there's different

01:41:30,659 --> 01:41:48,570
I didn't hyperfine but III know to come

01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:50,400
different benchmark Vera okay it's wrong

01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:52,909
every time every first day I get

01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,909
different numbers

01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:59,710
okay so design basically why it's like

01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:04,680
basically defined faster than the

01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:14,320
Pierces enough you're there so make sure

01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:18,210
there's no branches you mean check how

01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:22,530
many CPU internet no I didn't do that

01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:22,530
bio-rad France bechamel do that

01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:38,850
you

01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:47,360
I do I do that

too

01:51:55,330 --> 01:51:57,390
you

01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:18,719
this ownership now this is interesting

01:52:12,559 --> 01:52:22,579
as they make use of all the tables yes

01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:22,579

01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:26,490
and the plumbing you

01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:34,650
Destry problem here unique unity with

01:52:32,909 --> 01:52:37,999
the first coat or maybe to identify the

01:52:34,650 --> 01:52:41,269
problem earlier I identify one problem

01:52:37,999 --> 01:52:44,889
on the main course it's all about recipe

01:52:41,269 --> 01:52:44,889
I find personally I was really

01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:54,710
distracting you from the first piece

01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:54,710
