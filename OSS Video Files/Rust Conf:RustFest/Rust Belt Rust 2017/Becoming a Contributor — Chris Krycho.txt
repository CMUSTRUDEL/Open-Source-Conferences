Title: Becoming a Contributor — Chris Krycho
Publication date: 2018-01-06
Playlist: Rust Belt Rust 2017
Description: 
	So, you’re new to the Rust community. (Or any community, really!) And you want to help, but, well, you’re new. So how exactly do you start contributing? What kinds of contributions are valuable? We’ll talk about everything from asking questions to writing documentation, from pitching in on forums and chat to writing blog posts, and from starting your own projects to contributing to other open-source projects.

hello everyone I am as I was just

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,719
introduced Chris Cry Joe some of you

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,660
will know me as the host of new Russ

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,160
station of the podcast we have a little

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,410
more time than a normal new raw station

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,480
episode but we also have a boatload to

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,279
cover so I will let you stare at this

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,860
picture of my hilarious adorable family

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,320
for a moment longer and then we'll go so

00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:35,300
there are two big ideas I hope all of

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:39,440
you get from this talk idea number one

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:44,010
anyone can contribute meaningfully

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,770
number two people can contribute in a

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,180
variety of ways a stunning variety of

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,100
ways I dare say the theme here is

00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,860
becoming a contributor because I know

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,800
for many of us for me that can be an

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,290
intimidating a challenging a scary

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,989
process it can also be a process that

00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,810
can seem very limited in what it means

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,960
and I hope to dispel a lot of that today

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,790
in particular with these two ideas I

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,180
want you to come away recognizing that

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,570
not just even you but perhaps especially

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,540
you can be a contributor to rust to

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,299
whatever other tools you use there are

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,860
things you might have to offer

00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:28,020
particularly if you're new or if you're

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,490
an outsider or if this is your first

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,320
time doing this style of programming

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,330
there are things you have to offer that

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,799
someone who's been doing systems

00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,060
programming for 20 years and

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,799
contributing and open source the

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,200
entirety of that time doesn't have

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,869
because we all have blinders that we get

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,710
over time things that we're just in

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,270
nerds to and blinded to so everyone here

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,010
has something to contribute and your

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,689
outsider Ness is actually valuable so

00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:58,520
anyone and perhaps especially you and

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:01,350
then secondly there are so many ways so

00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,270
many ways you can contribute it's become

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,549
almost a cliche in this particular

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,759
community to say that code isn't the

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,500
only thing that matters but I want to

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,109
come away from this talk with you seeing

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,269
how true that is and you seeing how many

00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:16,530
other ways there are and how many other

00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:20,670
needs there are

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,160
for contributions that aren't code and I

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,800
want to preface all of this by asking

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,010
why why this talk why should you care

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,450
and why do I care because there are a

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,010
lot of things to be passionate about in

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,300
life there are a lot of things to be

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,910
passionate about in the world of

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,560
software development and the answer

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,890
comes down to something that we could

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,320
phrase as a dichotomy humanism or

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,330
technology ISM and to to borrow that

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,880
language from a developer I admire

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,510
immensely Scott vulajin is a developer

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,390
in the at Short community and he'll talk

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,510
in this way and until say I'm a humanist

00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,989
more than I am a technologist the

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,370
technologies are interesting I'm kind of

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,900
turning into a programming language nerd

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,640
and I blame rust but I'm at the end of

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,950
the day much more a humanist I care

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,650
about rust not just because type systems

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,300
are cool they are but fundamentally in

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,550
line with other talks we've heard today

00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,620
because they help people accomplish

00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,870
their goals and they help people solve

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,840
problems and in this case they help

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,630
people do that safely that matters and

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,450
as software developers I think we should

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:35,220
care about how the tools we use help us

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:37,049
serve people more effectively so it's

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,370
not one or the other but for me it's

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:44,400
more about the humanism so again going

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,290
back to those two big ideas that anyone

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,910
can contribute meaningfully and that

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:52,560
people can contribute in a stunning

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:54,120
variety of ways maybe let's mute that so

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,670
that I don't get another text message

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,420
from a family member

00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:02,640
do not disturb thank you why these two

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,739
ideas and the answer is that I think

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,110
they're the most applicable of anything

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,180
I could talk about in that kind of

00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,040
humanism technologies on thing to the

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,019
people here right now there are a lot of

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,989
things we could say about humanism in

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,220
technology but here especially in this

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,680
community perhaps especially in this

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,410
room we have a big open source focus and

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,960
I think these two things serve as lenses

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,580
into other ideas so you'll be able to

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,529
think of applications of the kinds of

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,799
things I say here to other projects

00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:34,719
so with that is background let's talk

00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:35,979
about the talk for a moment so you know

00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:38,289
where we're going because I'm going to

00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:40,989
cover a lot of ground we've done the

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:42,729
introduction now I'm going to say why

00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:45,369
bother contributing then I'm going to

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:47,019
say who is a contributor anyway then I'm

00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:49,989
going to ask what's a contribution how

00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:51,279
do you contribute and there's so many

00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,599
things in that category that they

00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,429
literally would not fit on this slide

00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,559
and still be readable so I didn't put

00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:59,229
them on this slide then we're going to

00:04:56,559 --> 00:05:00,519
ask when and where do you contribute and

00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:02,409
that's a question that I think we don't

00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:05,349
often ask but it's a really helpful one

00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:06,759
to ask and finally we will wrap it all

00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:08,349
up and you'll notice this kind of does

00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,079
the grammar school thing who what when

00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:12,849
where why and how and hopefully that'll

00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:15,309
give you a way to hang your hats on it

00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:17,499
as we cover a lot of material you'll

00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:19,899
also note that I took them out of order

00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:23,109
to be convenient and do what I want so

00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:26,169
you'll have to deal with that why should

00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:28,689
you bother contributing some of us feel

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:32,049
very comfortable just sitting and

00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:34,389
consuming the code and the answer I have

00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:36,999
is that there is more work to be done

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:39,819
then there are hands to do it and that's

00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:42,369
always true it doesn't matter what

00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:44,439
project you look at you'll find lots of

00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:46,360
open issues on git lab or github or

00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:47,679
bitbucket or wherever else because

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,179
there's a lot of work to be done and

00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:50,829
there are a lot of things that can be

00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:54,309
better and that's always true for any

00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:55,809
project any open-source maintainer can

00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:57,369
tell you the truth of this I've done a

00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:59,439
little bit of that in the last six

00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:01,419
months and Wow there is a lot to do that

00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,029
I just don't have time to get to I would

00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:06,489
love to help and so the people who make

00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,409
the tools that you use every day could

00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:13,089
probably use your help and you can help

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:15,549
them more than you think so then if

00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:18,549
you're persuaded that yeah there's work

00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:20,799
to do people need help and I really cut

00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:23,109
out to be a contributor but who is a

00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:25,659
contributor anyway is it someone who has

00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:27,369
commitment and the repository is it

00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:30,039
someone who's a glowing beacon of

00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:32,319
glorious open source community work who

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:36,759
ships a billion lines of code every year

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:41,130
no actually a contributor is anyone who

00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:45,940
improves a project full-stop

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:48,820
for example we might say someone who

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,950
submits a patch to fix a typo and that's

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,690
a very small example but it's actually a

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,630
really important one in my story and

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,400
I'll show you that in a minute

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,530
someone who adds a small correction for

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,320
a piece of code that's a sample in a

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,700
project so that someone can actually not

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,730
make the same mistake they made when

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,150
they copied code from the readme someone

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,920
who files an issue instead of just

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,830
suffering in silence through that

00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,660
problem or making a local patch so it

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,550
works but not up streaming it like even

00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,280
if you have legal reasons why you can't

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,690
you know actually upstream a patch you

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,180
can file an issue that gives someone

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,450
enough information that they can solve

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,370
it

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,770
that's contributing all of these things

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,630
are and in fact everything else we're

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,820
going to talk about today that's what

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,600
makes you a contributor is anyone who

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,400
improves a project and I'm not really

00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,670
exaggerating when I say that's how I got

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,260
started you can see here what my first

00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,350
contribution to the russ community is

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:50,010
this is a commit to rust by example and

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:55,470
there was a copy and pasted example from

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:58,620
iterator any into iterator find and

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:02,950
sorry this is not rust by example it's

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,210
docs for the api's and it had the wrong

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,560
word in the description so I literally

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,060
fixed one word in the description and

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,190
then I got the awesome rust high-five

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,710
bot that came out and said here's we're

00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,110
so happy you're here and it got merged

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,490
and I said I can actually contribute

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,320
something to this community this is

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,930
barely over two years ago I'm a

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,940
relatively well known voice literally

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,790
voice from the podcasting in the

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,580
community the reason I felt like I could

00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,470
do that is because of this commit I got

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,480
to contribute to rust and hopefully

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,030
smooth the path for a few people because

00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,520
of that commitment so again who is a

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,220
contributor well it's all of us if we

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,380
are chipping back in and adding things

00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,530
and improving things in the tools we use

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,060
I don't think most of you who are

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,560
already open-source contributors

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,100
probably have stories very different

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,570
from mine

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,840
you found a small thing to fix somewhere

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,730
and you did and now you might be

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,050
particularly skilled at that thing

00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,120
if you're looking around you might see

00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,380
someone who's particularly skilled at

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,649
that thing but this is how everyone

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,630
starts small you see a need you fill it

00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:07,529
and then ultimately by keeping at it for

00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:11,410
a long time you get somewhere and

00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:13,389
particularly an open source when you do

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,649
that you get this feeling of helping

00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,880
people that's good

00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,250
and I think there's a reason for that

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,790
we're meant as humans to help each other

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,980
and we're broken so we don't always do

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,699
that but we should aspire to we should

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:30,820
help each other it's good so when we say

00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:33,190
who's a contributor it's anyone who

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,130
improves a project and that's really all

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,120
there is to it

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,899
sometimes we want to quibble with that

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,720
definition but I think the main reasons

00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:46,240
we tend to quibble are ego their turf

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,980
defending their wanting to prop up

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,300
ourselves and make our own contributions

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,620
feel like the most important or the most

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,570
valuable I like the way someone famous

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,779
put it in something I read recently

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:02,290
which is anyone who would be first must

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:04,360
be last must be the servant of all and I

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,709
hope I evinced that attitude and I would

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,600
encourage all of you to have insight

00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:10,180
attitude be servants of the people

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,610
around you when we stop worrying about

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,250
turf marking and building up our own

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,709
prestige and start rejoicing in the ways

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,540
that we can help each other even if they

00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,160
look and sometimes perhaps especially if

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,490
they look different from our own ways

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,209
our projects get better and in small

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:30,449
ways but real ways the world gets better

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:33,100
the last thing I hope this encourages

00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:35,829
you to remember there's no magic to

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,300
being a contributor again you just chip

00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:40,649
in where you have skills that can help

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:44,170
and all of you have skills that can help

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:46,089
so what and how can you contribute this

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,500
is a very very long list and we're not

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:51,970
going to spend a lot of time on any

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,980
particular detail but I hope it helps

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,250
you come away from here feeling like I

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,350
can do one of the things on this list

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:02,800
we'll start with the obvious one you can

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,510
write code and there are a lot of ways

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,920
you can write code you can fix bugs you

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,510
can implement features you can look for

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,560
open issues and go after it and you

00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,360
should write

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,010
code is fun that's why most of us are

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,230
here because we like doing that and we

00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:20,080
want to empower each other to do that

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,060
you'll find tags like this so even if

00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,360
it's your first time contributing you

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:28,120
look for an e mentor tag or an e ez tag

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,800
on other non-core rust projects you'll

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,360
see things like good first issue if

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,790
you've never written a line of

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,220
open-source before pick these go into

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,260
the mentoring ones and say look I would

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,790
love to contribute to rust itself will

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,710
someone teach me how and it's got a

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,260
mentor tag on it the answer is yes we

00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:48,430
will teach you how I also want to

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:51,400
emphasize we don't swear it people or

00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,779
call them names in this community when

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,860
we make mistakes because you know what

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,240
we're all humans and we all make

00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,440
mistakes and it doesn't matter how long

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,240
you've been doing this I've been writing

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,020
software for about a decade I make

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,250
mistakes every day and we don't insult

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,589
each other over that and that's a big

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,420
deal so don't feel intimidated like

00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:09,610
that's how it's going to go we want to

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,710
help you we've got these tags here

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,600
because we want to help you contribute

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,690
we want you to recognize that you can do

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,970
this but I'm going to caveat all of that

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,220
as good as it is by saying code is not

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,870
the only thing it's not even necessarily

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,970
the most important contribution you can

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,380
make in any given project it's just the

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,540
most obvious one because what we're

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,180
talking about is software so here are

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,770
all the other things that you can do to

00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,440
contribute and sometimes they'll be more

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:38,440
important I mentioned this earlier you

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,940
can file bugs and this is actually one

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,710
of the most important things you can do

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,350
and one of the easiest things you can do

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,210
I'll tell you a secret if the person who

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,430
shipped the library doesn't already have

00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:51,339
an open issue for your bug they probably

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,810
don't know about it which means that the

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:55,060
only way they can fix it is if you tell

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,580
them so please file an issue on

00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,780
something now I opened this to rip grep

00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,490
and as it turns out I've never actually

00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,350
run into a bug with rip grep I'm sure

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,230
there are some I saw some open issues

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,550
but I opened this one intentionally

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,750
because it's one that I've never had to

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,390
file an issue on but you know what if I

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,760
run into a bug with rip grep well burnt

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:17,560
sushi wants me to file an issue and tell

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,470
him so he can fix it to docs and we're

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,460
gonna spend a little while on this one

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,780
you're probably as a developer all

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,100
on board with the importance of

00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,280
documentation at least in principle

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,490
because undocumented or badly documented

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,020
projects are terrible to use you show up

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,000
and you say what what do I do with this

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,740
and then you say I don't know presumably

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,660
I connect to a database with it but

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,170
there's no documentation so how do I do

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,520
that

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,800
and you fight with it and you fight with

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:46,070
it and you fight with it it's it's bad

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,020
so contributing here is one of the

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,900
easiest ways that you can add to a

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:54,260
project going beyond that filing issues

00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,730
step it's also harder in a lot of ways

00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,300
than writing the code is because it's

00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:01,400
all about communicating now why you

00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,380
rather than the implementer and the

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,480
answer is that the explanation of how

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,130
things work under the hood is something

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,420
an implementer is probably always going

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,830
to be relatively good at they

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,420
implemented it they know how it works

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,610
but that doesn't necessarily mean

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,410
they're the best at explaining how to

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,810
start with it because they already have

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,860
it all in their heads it doesn't

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,350
necessarily mean that they're the best

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,600
at writing API Docs for the same reason

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,640
learning materials for the same reason

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,380
sometimes someone coming in trying to

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,510
use the project is actually better

00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,370
equipped to help communicate those

00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,590
things because they're going through the

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:37,310
process of learning it themselves they

00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:40,340
know what the pain points are so if you

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:42,680
feel like yeah bye I have no idea how to

00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,840
write documentation well there are

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,000
actually three easy steps to write good

00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:52,070
basic documentation for anything one as

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,680
you're going write down the things you

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,270
don't understand so if you're working

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,860
through a library and you're trying to

00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,600
figure out how to call an API write it

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,760
down say I don't know how this works and

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,070
write down the specific things that you

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,870
don't know how they work and then to

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,410
when you figure them out write that down

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,500
too and what you have just done is say

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,750
here's a problem here's the solution

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,270
that solves it using this API you just

00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,770
rode ox-3

00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:20,780
don't keep the Docs to yourself file an

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,940
issue open a PR share it with everyone

00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,440
else and suddenly everyone else who is

00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,690
going to hit that same pain point

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,920
they're not going to anymore because you

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:32,750
just solved it for them now in the realm

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,360
of documentation there's a lot more than

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,230
API Docs

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,940
there are API

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,650
and we should write those and we should

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,410
be grateful that a lot of Russ projects

00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:44,660
have API Docs and you should turn on the

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,120
lint that will make the compiler error

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,710
if you don't have documented items and

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,990
then you shouldn't lie to the compiler

00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,060
by just putting a documentation item on

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,160
it even though it's empty document your

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,300
stuff please

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,860
but reap meas read meas our

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,190
documentation and they're usually for

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,780
people's first encounter with your code

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,760
tutorials if you can write a good

00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,460
tutorial that shows someone that even

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,410
just the very basics of how to get going

00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,900
with your code base that takes you a

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,480
long way toward people being able to

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,580
actually build something with it API

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,710
Doc's don't tell me how to fit the

00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,730
pieces of the API together a tutorial

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:24,280
does books books sounds scary and

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:27,140
intimidating because they're long and

00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,390
that's true they are they are hard but

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,930
not every book is the russ programming

00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:36,020
language version 2o a lot of books are

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:40,970
much smaller I see you looking at me

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:43,490
back there Steve you can do like Daniel

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:46,490
keep did and wrote the little book of

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,840
rust macros in rust 1.0 that's a great

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,660
guide if you want to learn how to write

00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,160
macros you can if you're sitting down

00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,230
and writing and finding that you have a

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,970
lot to say or an area where there isn't

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,430
a lot of documentation you can write a

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,500
book and use MD book or lean pub or any

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,760
number of ways to put it up there and be

00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,800
useful to people without going through

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,709
the big publisher side of things and

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,620
that's really useful finally and this

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:12,560
one's dear to my heart and in 2018 as

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,959
part of the push for Russ 2019 I'm going

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,640
to be hammering at this chipping on the

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,370
rust reference there are a lot of parts

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:24,020
of the language that are only documented

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:25,130
in RFC s that stinks it's really hard to

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,589
know about them if you have to go

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,690
trolling through rfcs to figure them out

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,340
so chipping on things like the rust

00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,830
reference and you'll find similar things

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:38,240
in other communities in other projects

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:40,520
in other languages translation is also

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,790
really valuable with documentation and I

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:47,150
want to come at this from two directions

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:49,340
one English is sort of assumed as the

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,120
standard language especially by

00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,400
Americans

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,830
but an awful lot of people in the world

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,670
don't speak English and for an awful lot

00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:00,200
more let me say that backwards most

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,450
people in the world don't speak English

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,490
and for an awful lot of those who do

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,620
English is a second language and it's a

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,260
lot of work so if you can provide a

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,540
localized version of documentation

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,790
that's an enormous win it makes it far

00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,440
more accessible to more people and by

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,420
the flipside there are brilliant

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,800
developers who speak every language and

00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,190
a lot of them have to learn enough

00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,650
English to get by but look if you speak

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:27,230
amharic and you know some ethiopian

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,580
developers who are turning out fabulous

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,679
libraries but they're not that

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,300
comfortable writing english translate

00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,580
for them and all of a sudden you're

00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,530
making you're taking advantage of the

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,070
fact that English is this sort of lingua

00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,809
franca to popularize things out of other

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,850
language communities to make them

00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:47,450
broadly accessible those kinds of things

00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,610
are huge and we don't do enough of it so

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,890
please if you know languages unlike me I

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,929
know classical Greek and Biblical Hebrew

00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:57,080
and no one's asking for documentation in

00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:57,980
those for some reason I don't know why

00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,240
Plato

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:05,240
you know you'd think he'd be interested

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:06,860
in this stuff but he's kind of dead the

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,720
language in this slide is very precise

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,490
for a reason I gave a version of this

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,840
talk before it and someone thought I was

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,020
talking about the language design I was

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,720
like no no no no the visual design for a

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:20,059
lot of our things needs work the

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,190
language design is great but the visual

00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:24,260
design for things like the landing page

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,670
or documentation I was having

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,559
conversation with someone earlier today

00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,730
who said it's just kind of a wall of

00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,170
text I don't know what to do with it

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,429
because he was just getting started and

00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,679
I think that's a feeling many of us have

00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:35,809
had it's also a problem that people are

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,809
actively working on Russ talk the next

00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:40,610
is coming but I mean it's a lot of work

00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,309
to do this kind of stuff so you can help

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:46,390
and you can perhaps especially help if

00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:50,090
you have some talent for visual design

00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:52,400
because let's be honest most systems

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,360
programmers historically it's not what

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,270
they're interested in they're interested

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,070
in like how kernels work and while

00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,230
there's sometimes some overlap that's

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:03,230
not historically how it's been likeliest

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,010
to be but we don't have to let that be

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,110
the final say

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:08,390
Carol said in the keynote earlier that

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:12,020
rust can be an enabling technology I

00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:14,060
agree with her about that so what we

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,470
ought to do is instead of saying well or

00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,620
just system programmers we don't care

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,390
about that we should instead do what we

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,210
try to do all the time here and bend the

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:26,570
curve and make rust stand out in this

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,210
area make things easy to access easy to

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,280
understand so how do you do that

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,440
well if you're a person who does

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,690
actually have some affinity for design

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,130
whether you're an expert who's coming in

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,600
because your background was designed but

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,030
you decided to switch careers and Russ

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,340
looks interesting or you're just a

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,230
talented amateur pitch in we could

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,830
really use help in this area there's an

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:51,890
imperial rust 2017 project to improve

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:54,470
the homepage we need your help if you've

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:57,560
got good HTML and CSS chops please chip

00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,060
in and if you're just flat bad at design

00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,760
and you know what it's okay to be just

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,650
flat bad at design please don't let that

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,530
be an excuse to put up something in

00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:09,500
Times New Roman with no styles that's

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:12,950
impossible to read use something like

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,600
bootstrap or use one of these frameworks

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,030
I poked around a little yesterday

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,500
they're very minimal CSS frameworks some

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,750
of them don't make you even write any

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,640
classes on your HTML they just style

00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:25,010
your elements nicely so you can

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,250
literally just write markdown and pump

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:30,710
it out and put a link href style sheet

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,120
in the head of your HTML and you're

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,850
going to have something that's way

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,620
easier to digest because whether you

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,870
want to call it irrational or not I

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,970
would not but we do respond to visual

00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,550
design things that are attractive matter

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,170
one reason that rocket RS made a huge

00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,510
splash when it came out is because it

00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,100
has a really snazzy website and it looks

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,440
awesome and it makes you want to use it

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,330
and I actually think that's a good thing

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,670
and how humans are built but even if you

00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,890
don't recognize that it is part of how

00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:01,070
humans are built and like I said use one

00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,930
of these I also want you to think about

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,270
what designers will sometimes call

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:08,600
information hierarchy or you might call

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,970
an outline how you structure the content

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,640
on your website matters it makes it more

00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,020
or less comprehensible to people so

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,180
think about how you put stuff together

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,140
that will go a lot longer and a lot

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,200
further than you might

00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:25,010
realize next up let's talk about

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,520
blogging I know no one blogs anymore we

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,740
tweet thread please blog please code

00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:35,150
samples work a lot better in blogs just

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,910
saying I know blogging feels hard to

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,470
people because writing is hard work and

00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,970
writing words to communicate to people

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,160
is not the same thing as writing

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,170
software even to communicate to other

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,990
people there are different skills and so

00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,760
this may feel really hard at first but

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,170
it doesn't have to be amazing you can

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,650
just start and you'll get better with

00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,110
practice

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:58,550
you may never be TS Eliot but you'll get

00:22:54,110 --> 00:23:00,830
better with practice I want to describe

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,540
blogging on easy mode and it's basically

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,000
something I've already said but I want

00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,710
you to take away that it really is just

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,930
this simple write down what you're

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,570
learning and so that process that you

00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:13,520
use for writing Docs and sending pull

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,080
requests is the same write a blog post

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,930
in which you say I didn't know this

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,940
thing now I kind of know this thing

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,710
here's my summary of it and even if you

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,710
get some friendly correction from people

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,470
you'll have helped others process that

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:29,210
same new idea and you'll get some Google

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,830
foo and people will go searching for

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,480
answers to that question and you'll have

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,090
helped other people through that process

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,640
and I want to give you two good examples

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:40,250
to go look up of totally different

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,290
styles of doing this one of them is and

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:45,560
I hope I say her name right apologies if

00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:47,960
I don't vitae he Joshi who's written a

00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,330
series called base X on her medium site

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,130
and this is basically just introduction

00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:55,370
to concepts in computer science

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:57,020
algorithms data types etc this has been

00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,220
really helpful for me in part because I

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,200
don't have a computer science background

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,810
I have a physics degree I've learned

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,610
this all as I go this kind of stuff is

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,850
awesome for me and it's very detailed

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,070
and it's great review even if you have a

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,980
CS degree but it's 20 years old also

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:15,020
Julia Evans who's probably the best what

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,570
I just learned writer I have ever read

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,460
and she's hilarious and she has great

00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,650
comic illustrations you don't have to be

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,360
as good as either of them suffice it to

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,420
say there's a lot of ways you can do

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,160
this you can do one off things or you

00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,780
can write like I did an eighteen part

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,429
series comparing rust and Swift from the

00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:35,450
perspective of a beginner at both

00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:36,979
there's flexibility here you can talk

00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,629
about a particular technology you can

00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:41,440
introduce it you can do a deep dive on

00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:43,789
using it you can explain how it's built

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,529
you can and this is actually really

00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:48,229
really valuable especially when you do

00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:50,179
it kindly you can critique and highlight

00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:51,229
problems with things I know that one of

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:54,440
the things that's been helpful for

00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:56,629
Tokyo's iteration and its design is

00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,129
getting helpful critical feedback we

00:24:56,629 --> 00:25:01,759
need that nothing is perfect when we

00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:03,229
first ship it so critique kindly with

00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,710
the intent to help rather than to beat

00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:06,109
down

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,339
we need that you can demonstrate how to

00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:09,580
integrate different parts of the

00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,830
ecosystem one of the rusts reach

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,539
projects ended up including a blog post

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,609
that says here's how you use rocket and

00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:18,409
diesel to build a blog that was great

00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:20,690
and it answered questions I had about

00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,429
how to do exactly that you can also use

00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,559
blog posts to invite feedback on your

00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,330
own projects and say here's something I

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,019
did what do you think and people will

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:31,039
give you good input one that's very near

00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:33,979
and dear to my heart

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,899
audio and video people like getting

00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:38,749
things in ways that aren't just words we

00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:40,339
need noises and pictures too

00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:43,519
I'm gonna talk specifically about

00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:44,839
podcasts I get critiques sometimes if I

00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,609
just why don't you just write this as a

00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,559
script and for one thing the scripts are

00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:50,330
out there but for another not everyone

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,330
learns the same way some people hearing

00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:55,249
things that makes it click and also lots

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,379
of people have commutes and I can't read

00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:58,940
on a commute now some people can because

00:25:57,379 --> 00:26:00,289
they're on a subway and they can look at

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,609
their phone or whatever but for a lot of

00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:03,799
people they're stuck in traffic in a car

00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:06,019
for 20 minutes and you can listen to a

00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:07,940
podcast there too which you might say

00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:10,309
but they're all already podcasts and I

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,629
would say yes there are there's mine but

00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:13,339
you know what one podcast really isn't

00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:15,139
enough there's a lot of stuff going on

00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,309
in rust you say yeah but look there are

00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:18,109
two there's also requests for

00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:19,729
explanation I say yeah but really

00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,950
there's a lot going on in rust two

00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:24,019
podcasts is not enough vodcast you say

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,969
look Jonathan Turner just started rusty

00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:28,159
spike there's three podcasts already and

00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:28,669
I say you know what these cover a lot of

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,580
ground

00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:33,799
we need more podcasts try doing

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,049
tutorials for all sorts of things try

00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,820
doing nan tutorials try being the most

00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:41,570
awesome interview podcasts there are

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:43,309
options please podcast same thing with

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,320
video again people have different

00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,450
learning styles I heard

00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,700
often from people that rails cast was

00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,539
amazing this is how I got started with

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,940
rails we could use Rails casts for rust

00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:58,309
so if you have skills with video please

00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,809
use them we need them and again there

00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:01,580
are options here you can make screen

00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,590
casts you can livestream yourself

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,029
working on open source shelling Griffin

00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,889
has done that for diesel a couple of

00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:09,200
times and it's neat pair with somebody

00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:12,080
and stream that I'm sure you can think

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,149
of more the point is make video and

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,529
share it around it's really helpful as a

00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:19,570
resource and we don't have a lot of it

00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:21,679
for rust yet not least talk to people

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:25,279
you can do that online

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:28,460
IRC Gitter discourse you name it slack

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,590
etc do it online Russ does a lot of this

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,360
but also do it in person

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,580
do it at meetups in conference because

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,960
physicality matters and you all are

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,220
already persuaded of this you're at a

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,889
conference but if anyone out there is

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,960
watching online be persuaded of this

00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:43,519
meetups and conferences helped a lot and

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,169
they especially helped a lot of making

00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,759
you feel like okay I'm not alone

00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:48,950
because as great as the internet is

00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,049
sometimes it's isolating go to a meet-up

00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:55,460
found a meet-up help a meet-up star

00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:56,600
founder the last thing i want to say is

00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,129
to those of you who've been doing this

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,370
for a while and in the rust community i

00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:03,500
see this mostly all of you old-timers

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,840
still have things to contribute but some

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,759
of the most important is continuing to

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,059
be welcoming as you are and mentoring

00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:14,809
because getting started is hard and so

00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:17,450
taking your talents and your knowledge

00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:19,940
and investing them in new people is

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:23,120
actually sometimes more effective and

00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,779
has a multiplicative effect you can do a

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,600
lot more

00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:28,429
by helping 10 people get up to speed and

00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,870
be productive than you can yourself even

00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:33,409
if you're one of those magical 10x

00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:35,240
wizard unicorn programmers the last

00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:37,580
thing I want to say is when and where do

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,100
you contribute and I want to put this

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,049
two ways where are you in the process of

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,909
being comfortable with contributing are

00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:46,009
you just getting started or are you

00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:47,750
already comfortable if you're just

00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:50,000
getting started again look for these and

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,649
pick big projects because they're the

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,279
ones most equipped to help new people

00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:55,399
get started

00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:57,529
believe it or not servo and rust C are

00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:58,940
probably easier places to chip in in

00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:03,680
some ways because they have the in

00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:06,350
structure to help you then if you're

00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,720
already experienced the website is the

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,310
case find smaller projects and pick

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,020
something that just looks interesting to

00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,490
you which could use the help because

00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,140
you're going to be able to contribute

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,760
and help with a lot less of the

00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:20,240
mentoring and you can add the most value

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:23,720
there remember there's always more work

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,010
than hands so projects need you and then

00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,930
the other question to ask is about

00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,550
project life cycles where is a given

00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,920
project look if it's a small project

00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:34,220
that's basically done pick something

00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,230
else to work on if something is really

00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,810
solid that needs a lot of Doc's right

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:41,210
Doc's if there's big projects which have

00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,550
a billion needs think about your talents

00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,610
and the things you enjoy and find a way

00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,440
to chip in there back to where we

00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,570
started

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,580
anyone and I do mean anyone can

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,530
contribute meaningfully I hope everyone

00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,720
in this room running through that list

00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:59,630
has thought at least once you know that

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,640
is actually a thing I could do i I know

00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,190
how to do that thing or I haven't done

00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:07,040
that yet but I could and I hope you

00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:08,930
remember all those different ways or at

00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,030
least one of all of those different ways

00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:13,430
that you can contribute and you can make

00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:16,070
a difference to the success of this

00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:20,210
project of particular tools within the

00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:22,400
ecosystem that you use etc here are a

00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,350
short list of places that you might go

00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,600
to find more info on places to

00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:29,030
contribute the Imperia Dizz going on

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,520
right now for rust and it is a great

00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:34,820
time with a lot of focus on people

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:38,150
contributing so I hope you go contribute

00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,950
if you're flying home fine find a

00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:41,350
project to see what its state is and

00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:44,470
maybe write some Doc's on the plane

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,470
