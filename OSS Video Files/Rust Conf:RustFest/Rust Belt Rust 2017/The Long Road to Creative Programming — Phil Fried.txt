Title: The Long Road to Creative Programming — Phil Fried
Publication date: 2018-01-06
Playlist: Rust Belt Rust 2017
Description: 
	Creativity as a concept is not generally well understood, and that’s especially true as it applies to programming. Creativity can be either invaluable or dangerous, and sometimes it’s both. By understanding creativity, you’ll be able to leverage it to build awesome software. In this talk, we’ll explore what it means to be creative and how it relates to programming, and especially to Rust. Expect to come away with some tips for how to let your creativity flourish.

cool so as Jean said my name is Phil

00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:13,339
freed and I'm a developer over at pact

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:15,110
SATA yeah and I actually started off not

00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:18,380
in software development but I started

00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,300
studying painting and printmaking and so

00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,220
I come to this from a little bit of a

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,020
different angle and so that's why you

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,570
know I want to share some of that with

00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,900
you guys it's something that's been

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:33,379
pretty helpful to me which is why I want

00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,079
to share it so I want to start off right

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:38,690
off the bat I want to get this part out

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,019
of the way and that's you know just a

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,539
basic working definition of creativity

00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:46,579
and for our purposes it's just it's the

00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:50,329
production of something that is

00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:52,399
innovative and useful and I think it's

00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:54,170
important to you know point out that

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,499
there's really those both have to be

00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,170
there right if it's just novel but not

00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:04,610
really useful for anything what's the

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:06,440
point and if it's useful but already

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:10,340
somebody's already built it then why

00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,860
build it again and so we really want

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:16,520
both of those things and this is

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:19,009
important all of these things that we

00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,380
use day-to-day right everything from the

00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:22,969
you know personal computer to the data

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:28,189
structures and algorithms that we use

00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:30,979
these are all creative productions so we

00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:33,200
want as as developers we want more of

00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:35,840
this right we can build upon our

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,500
previous creative productions to to get

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,670
more it's an awesome system you know we

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,329
look at some of these things in the

00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:47,780
slide and you know awesome stuff built

00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:50,380
by amazing people and you know this

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,950
really points out one of the biggest

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:56,509
sort of intuitive knowledge is that that

00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,539
we all bring to the table about

00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:03,530
creativity is we have this concept of

00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:08,210
creative people and so you know here we

00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:12,409
have Leonardo da Vinci and Mozart and on

00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:14,239
the the right is Grace Hopper and you

00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:16,530
know these are amazing folks that have

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,810
built awesome awesome stuff

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:24,450
and they're really they're Giants and

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:27,180
these people are all awesome but they

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:31,260
stand out in history because they're so

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,110
rare and the truth is that most creative

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,540
productions aren't built by Leonardo da

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,300
Vinci most of the stuff that we know and

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:43,709
love or it's built by everybody here

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,300
right anybody can be creative and you

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,330
don't have to be da Vinci or Grace

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,870
Hopper in order to build something that

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,000
is both innovative and useful and so

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,670
what this talk is really about it's

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,560
about empowering everybody here and I

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,290
want to say that you know our view of

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,260
creativity we I don't want to look at

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,000
this fatalistically right creativity is

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,000
not something that's randomly doled out

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,250
to a select few at Birth it's something

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,010
that can be learned and nurtured and

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:19,290
cultivated and that's a really important

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:22,709
idea so to illustrate this we're gonna

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,540
take a step back in history all of you

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,390
in this room you're all gonna come back

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,640
in time with me we're gonna go back in

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,290
time to the early Dark Ages in England

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,120
and we're going to talk about the

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:40,110
history of the word creative so a long

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:44,209
time ago we of course live in an

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,769
anarcho-syndicalist commune and the

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,720
creative is not even a word at this

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,329
point in history it's not a thing it's

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,720
not a concept at all and you know if

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,310
we're all back in the this time period

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,920
night so this may be about a hundred

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,860
people in this room ninety five of you

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,860
are all just working morning till night

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,910
on producing food and what you do is you

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,209
work morning tonight and you produce

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,829
barely enough food to survive so we're

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,320
all just kind of barely not dying and

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:16,049
what that means but since we have such a

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:19,290
small surplus so so let's take an

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:22,049
example right I'm Dennis over here and I

00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,990
want to try to innovate in how I do my

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,849
farming right I'm gonna I'm gonna try

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,860
this new idea for how do I plant my

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:36,430
crops I try it out

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:41,830
and it doesn't work we're screwed we're

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:45,010
screwed this is a big problem so the

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,380
consequences are dire now a bit later in

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,230
history right we we move forward a

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,250
couple hundred years and the situation

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,320
looks a little bit better I have a

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,630
little bit more of a surplus this

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,510
affords me the opportunity to be a

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:01,510
little bit more experimental this is

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,850
awesome and turns out at this point in

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,520
history is when we see the first usages

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:09,280
the first glimmers of the concept of

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,430
creative creative is this is the first

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,550
time creative is used as a word so let's

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:18,730
keep going and we're now at the end of

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:21,250
the 17th century and we've got a pretty

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,780
good surplus this affords us the

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,580
opportunity for all sorts of

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,490
experimentation we're having all kinds

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,100
of fun here at this point we've got the

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,890
Globe Theatre the Royal Academy for the

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,070
Arts is just about to be founded and the

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:39,160
word creative at this point is now used

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,710
to talk about the works of people so

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,510
back a couple hundred years before this

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,970
creative was just barely a word and it

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,670
only referred to the works of like the

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:53,020
divine right it was like it took some

00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:57,400
some powerful juju and now so-called

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,850
great men can be creative reflecting

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,810
sort of the the sexism of the time but

00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:08,320
today today is totally different story

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:11,380
so now we use the term creative for all

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,890
sorts of things right we we use the term

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,020
creative to refer to people you know a

00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,520
kid does a drawing and you say oh that's

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,870
very creative right I'll put it on the

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,940
fridge and we even expand the usage of

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,010
that word to mean things that are not

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,540
necessarily great right I mean somebody

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,780
says oh what do you think of my new

00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,780
tattoo and you're like oh it's creative

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:45,260
and and in fact I mean you could go to

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:46,730
prison for creative accounting and it

00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,190
turns out that these negative

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,010
connotations are there for a very good

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,610
reason the word creative has these

00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:58,790
connotations because it's risky most

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,140
attempts that creativity fail so this

00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,050
graph this is probably the most

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,180
important thing in the whole talk we're

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,070
getting to it right off the bat and

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,550
that's because it points out the

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:13,670
relationship between risk and creativity

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:18,500
when risk is high creativity is low and

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:21,260
when risk is low creativity gets high so

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,540
it's pretty easy to see why you know we

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,690
consider the the dark ages that dark

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,970
ages right because innovation was risky

00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:32,900
people didn't want to be creative you

00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:35,770
know cuz the whole death thing no

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,780
another important point about this is

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,180
you know I want to try to think about it

00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:45,200
in a slightly different way you know the

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,570
the creativity spectrum and so here you

00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,080
know on the one side we have a soldier

00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:56,690
who is soldiering and we have George

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,160
Clinton who is George Clinton and you

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,370
know I think it's important to point out

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,470
that okay again right the risk thing if

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,300
the soldier tries something creative and

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,930
it doesn't work out the consequences are

00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:11,540
very very dire and if George Clinton

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,670
tries to write a song and fails he just

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,320
throws that bit away and nobody ever

00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,400
hears he writes another one it's no big

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,450
deal right it cause it's like nothing

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,240
but the important thing to point out

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:26,270
here is that this has nothing to do with

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:30,110
them as people and everything to do with

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,630
their pursuit right this soldier could

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:36,170
be an immensely creative person you know

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,060
back at home when you know he's doing

00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,250
something else maybe he's writing rust I

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,640
don't know

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:46,250
yeah and George Clinton if he was you

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,160
know off fighting some foreign war might

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:52,880
not be very creative

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,430
so the key point is really just that the

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,670
pursuit is what determines whether or

00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:01,670
not we're being creative and so as

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,019
software developers of course I mean all

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,769
of you probably know what's coming next

00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:15,019
right we are all the way over here most

00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:20,420
of us so can't off that picture just

00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:22,040
cracks me up every time so we think you

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,410
know we work in one of the most pliable

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,130
mediums ever created by any code

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:31,240
especially if you have VCS what's the

00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:34,579
worst what's worse that can happen well

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,589
it's not quite that simple is it right

00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:39,230
anybody here ever you know write code

00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:42,260
that you know for something that really

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,600
just can't fail right people people

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,990
writing code that's running you know

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,649
rockets and cars and assembly lines and

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:55,010
things like that so if we want to

00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:57,920
increase creativity what we need to do

00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,959
is we need to talk about risk and we

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,130
need to be open about that have a good

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:06,079
open discussion about the types of risk

00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:09,019
because it turns out risk is a little

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,209
more nuanced than just like oh well you

00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:13,730
you live or you die right there's tons

00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:15,380
of different kinds of risk so you know

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,810
the obvious one is just like functional

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,699
right it's possible that my code could

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:23,890
be buggy okay

00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:27,079
there's also you know most of us are

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,660
writing code you know maybe for a job

00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:32,750
right so there's financial risk to

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,540
business this happens especially when

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,579
you have an established product right an

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,010
established company that's got a pretty

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:43,640
good revenue coming in off of some core

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:46,880
features all right so it's not really

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,160
make a ton of sense to try to you know

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,560
take risks in innovating on these core

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,690
features that represent a major revenue

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,100
stream right you're gonna be a little

00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:01,190
more cautious about that delivery you

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,820
know you could maybe take

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:08,930
too long to deliver it there's risk

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:11,750
there timing so you know great example

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:14,330
of dealing with all these risks is what

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,300
we just heard about stylo if you think

00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,970
about the approach to that project and

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,640
it was not just like oh well let's open

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,710
up the firefox source tree and start

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,740
hacking in there right it's just

00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:31,880
developed as a separate thing and that

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,800
was for a lot of reasons not but one of

00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:39,680
the major ones is it allowed those

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:41,060
developers to be more creative so apart

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,360
from these things right this kind of

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,390
like you know institutional kind of you

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,380
know things just talked about with risk

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:53,030
you know this is a really important one

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:55,340
gets sort of lost a lot of times when we

00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,260
talk about risk you know for us

00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,980
individually are there social

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,650
consequences of failure right so if I'm

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:07,490
live coding up here and I got like how

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:09,590
creative am I going to be let's it's

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,810
probably not gonna work right do you

00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,460
guys want to sit and watch me you know

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:17,780
fight compiler errors all the time or

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,840
you know write bugs this is an important

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,840
thing

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,910
thank you this is an important thing to

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,160
talk about though and and this really

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,610
reflects on you know our engineering

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,010
culture right what is what do we say

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,860
culturally about this concept of failure

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,890
and what is our what is our relationship

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:45,470
you know as an institution with failure

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:47,750
and of course personal this one again

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,240
you know it can be tough to talk about

00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,310
we don't really have a lot of language

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,370
for that but I think anybody here could

00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:58,339
understand the experience of you know

00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,930
trying something that doesn't work right

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,190
maybe the business doesn't care maybe

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,770
nobody else in the room is really

00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:07,280
worried about it but if I personally

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:09,080
have a hard time with that failure then

00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,680
it's gonna be hard for me to take those

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,760
risks and this is another one especially

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,860
you know it gets often overlooked

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,200
you know with you know groups of

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,480
engineers you know we like to talk about

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,770
the technical side and the technical

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:32,280
risks this is a huge huge barrier to

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:33,810
actual creativity so okay we are

00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,920
engineers we like to talk about the

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:39,870
technical stuff so let's do that right

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,210
let's talk about how we can reduce risk

00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,940
in code there's a couple of pretty easy

00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,860
things that you know I'm sure gonna be

00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,990
fairly obvious to most people if you

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,330
think about it a little bit right if I

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,180
want to be more creative in my in say a

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,880
refactoring if I have unit tests that

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,160
goes a long way to help that right I can

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,140
you know do whatever I want and as long

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,670
as my tests pass if I'm confident you

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,660
know this gives me the ability to be

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:09,360
very creative version control I don't

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,850
think anybody here is probably like

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,620
everybody's using that but I want to

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,990
call out that it's really important that

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,930
we do this allows us to be creative

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:22,410
anybody have branches sitting around on

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:26,940
their side projects so it's like oh I

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:33,630
thought that was a good idea I've got a

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:35,580
million of them and of course you could

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,250
write it in rust if I want to be

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,430
creative about how I do something with

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:43,230
regard to memory and layout or

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:45,510
parallelism it's rust gonna help me a

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,030
beat more creative well it's gonna

00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:51,510
reduce risk isn't it yeah absolutely

00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:54,690
well this is a great thing that you can

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,840
do um but it's also important you know

00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:02,160
to add a little bit of nuance to this

00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:05,190
you know this stuff it applies it it

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,290
depends on the scenario right so there's

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:11,040
a lot of different ways that we can be

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:13,680
innovative and I have the Linux penguin

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,140
up here because Linux is to me is a

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,480
great example of this well when people

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,360
think about creativity another one of

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,430
these sort of you know the things that

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,110
we intuitively think about you know we

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,630
think about things that are functionally

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,570
brand-new and Linux is a great example

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,090
because

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,560
you know it started out Kaddu Linux was

00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,510
just a clone of something that already

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,610
existed right

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,070
it wasn't bringing new functionality

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,320
what it was bringing in terms of

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,380
innovation is it was extremely

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,360
innovative on the process of development

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,060
it was extremely innovative in how it

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,300
engaged with developers and engaged with

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:55,360
users and we've seen a ton of value with

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,280
that I don't think anybody would would

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,940
argue that you know that's really

00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:04,210
ultimately helped and then being for so

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:08,400
they they were able to build creative

00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:13,830
and innovative features because of that

00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:16,360
so I don't think you can understate the

00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:21,250
importance of the relationship between

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:24,160
risk and creativity and I think you know

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,040
everybody here being very smart you know

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,890
when you go in back into your life and

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,930
you look at a task and you say I want to

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,270
be more creative and how I solve this

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,840
you know I want this and I want the

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,670
results to be awesome you guys are all

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,230
gonna be able to think of ways that you

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:46,960
can reduce risk the solutions for that

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:49,900
tend to be context dependent but they

00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:53,830
also tend to be pretty easy to arrive at

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:58,330
when you think about it so moving on

00:16:53,830 --> 00:17:02,620
from the risk I want to talk a little

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:05,050
bit about creativity and some of the

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,770
other things that kind of happen there

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:10,570
right I how many of you guys you know

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,280
you go to like a corporate training

00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:16,300
event or something and they say we want

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:20,040
to increase creativity so everybody go

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:22,170
into a room and paint pumpkins or

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,180
something like that

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,690
you know I think the risk thing is far

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:32,050
more important straight up if we want to

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,790
increase creativity we first things we

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,900
should do is talk about being able to

00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:40,000
reduce risk in all those different areas

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,220
however there is some other important

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,490
stuff there too and so what I want to do

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,400
is I've

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:49,840
talk about how creativity works in terms

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:54,220
of to serve generic phases and we'll

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,250
call it ideation and evaluation so

00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,880
coming up with creative ideas and then

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,200
deciding does this really have any merit

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,030
so I'm gonna start by looking at just

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:10,179
the the ideation part and you know the

00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,890
Venn diagram here is really just a

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:15,460
pretty simple illustration of exactly

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:17,800
what happens when we do this right when

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:21,100
I come up with ideas in my mind what's

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,230
happening is that I'm looking on drawing

00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,220
from my breadth of experience and

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:29,650
memories and I'm looking for overlaps

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:33,940
right maybe I'm working on say I'm

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:37,540
writing a garbage collector but you know

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:41,350
in my past I have experience churning

00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,650
butter and I come up with some crazy

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,870
overlap between churning butter and

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:51,640
garbage collecting this is the kind of

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:54,340
stuff that pops out and we want these

00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,590
ideas at this phase you know we're not

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,870
really deciding whether it has merit or

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,420
not and and it's important to to

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:06,220
recognize that at this point we're also

00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:09,850
not our ideas are not solutions right

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,530
our ideas may lead to solutions but at

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,840
this stage you know we're really just

00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:17,679
we're looking for the overlaps and

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,320
seeing you know presents a path that we

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,480
may choose to follow some people would

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,940
say that you're generating like a mental

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:31,270
representation of how you think about

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:32,800
the problem so we've got a number of

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,929
things that we can do here to kind of

00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,179
help this out right we can indulge our

00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:39,690
curiosity everybody's here

00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:41,800
being enriched by this conference

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,330
learning about what other people are

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,910
doing even though it might not have

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,250
anything to do with the specific tasks

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,460
that you're working on this is helping

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:56,250
you be more creative diversity is a huge

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:58,950
one right what's going to kill our crea

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,600
Vivat e is if we came to a conference

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,930
like this and it was all just people

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,970
like us right diversity is a huge thing

00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,590
and this is great because you know it's

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,750
not just it's not just at an

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:14,360
institutional level right but also

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:16,830
personal so where am i spending my time

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,310
when we're talking about this this

00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:22,770
ideation phase what we really need to do

00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:25,140
if we want to be more creative is we

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:31,320
need to cultivate this breadth of

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:40,950
experience I want to just shout out a

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:45,360
quick word of warning here I see a lot

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:48,180
of you agree yeah so this is because it

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,470
doesn't work because these are not this

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,500
is not the kind of stuff that we can

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:55,170
really internalize that enriches our

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,240
breadth of experience just sitting next

00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,700
to somebody who's different than me

00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,280
doesn't enrich my breadth of experience

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,300
if I don't engage with them if I don't

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:11,130
work with them and talk with them so we

00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:15,330
can't just fake it right so this is

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:18,690
ideation we've come up with you know the

00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:21,090
overlap between butter-churning and

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,930
garbage collection and no I have no idea

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,550
how I thought of that as an example

00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:30,480
let's just say it was creative and it's

00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:32,610
maybe not the best so after we come up

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,340
with this this idea right we have this

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,170
this structure or this representation of

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:41,790
the problem and we're gonna follow this

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:44,220
path we then evaluate it and here it's

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,810
it's the story is very different I mean

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,550
this is one of the another reason why

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,950
these like open floor plans and things

00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,930
like that don't work because here what

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,880
we really want is we want a depth of

00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,920
knowledge not a breadth of breadth of

00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,260
knowledge isn't necessarily as helpful

00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,740
here we want the depth of knowledge we

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,460
want critical thinking and we want focus

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:08,550
most people at this stage of the game

00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:10,380
tend to be kind of quiet part of these

00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,559
you know these theories of creative

00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:17,010
came about the earliest ones we're just

00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:19,140
absurd based on observations of you know

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,530
people that others thought of as

00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,330
creative and people would see you know

00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,080
folks who they thought of as creative

00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,380
and they said Wow

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:32,039
you know I happen to notice that Tolkien

00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:34,049
takes a walk every morning and because

00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:38,630
kind of you know gives himself time for

00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:40,799
some quiet contemplation and so

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,870
evaluation what we're really doing is

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:48,150
we're turning this over and deciding

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:50,220
whether it's worth pursuing again we

00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,960
don't have a full solution at this point

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,110
we've only got this kind of weird

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,919
morphus overlap between multiple ideas

00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:03,990
and what happens is that this ends up

00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:06,710
circling back to this ideation phase all

00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:09,990
right so so this is a cyclic thing and

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,940
one informs the other so I come up with

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,900
my overlap with the garbage collection

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,809
and the butter-churning

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:19,230
and I turn it over in my mind for like

00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:22,580
five seconds maybe and I'm like I don't

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,580
think that's worth pursuing

00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:27,519
and the important thing maybe it is you

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,879
know what somebody in this room is gonna

00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,919
prove me wrong

00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:37,450
butter GC is gonna be the next big java

00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:39,460
feature I can feel it comin but you know

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:43,419
it cycles back to innovation and it

00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,889
changes our worldview so when I evaluate

00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:48,039
this idea and I say you know what that

00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:52,240
wasn't right then it changes how I then

00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:56,499
think of future problems so in this way

00:23:52,240 --> 00:24:00,899
it kind of builds on itself you know I

00:23:56,499 --> 00:24:04,480
have a picture of blind justice here and

00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:07,960
it's really a bit misleading because the

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,119
truth is at this evaluation step this is

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,600
not simple this is not a simple decision

00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:16,899
where we say oh this is going to work or

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,299
this is not going to work you know most

00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:22,210
of us as coders have been in the

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:24,039
experience where somebody comes up and

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,320
asks you well can you make this work and

00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,960
you think well yeah I can get out the

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,909
big hammer right we can get that square

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,899
peg through a round hole if we push hard

00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:37,240
enough and what this is really about is

00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:40,179
if it's not whether or not it can

00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,700
technically be made to work it's more

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,869
about the principle of affordance

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,690
anybody ever heard of the principle of

00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:47,710
affordance hugely important design

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,629
principle you guys are all gonna

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,919
understand it pretty quickly with this

00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:57,039
next image so when we are talking about

00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:00,940
making something you know we take this

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:04,299
this idea that we have and we imagine

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:06,490
what its gonna look like and if you look

00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:09,399
at the doors over here all right if I'm

00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:12,249
designing a door handle I would say that

00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:15,580
the door handle on the right affords

00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:17,409
pulling when you look at it you

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,809
immediately think oh I could pull that

00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:22,570
right and you would try to pull it and

00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:24,299
how many people probably try to pull on

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,019
that door without ever reading the sign

00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:29,980
probably happens all the time

00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:33,100
I mean I do it and we're someone on the

00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:36,140
left you know it's pretty obvious how

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:39,110
it's supposed to be used

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:43,970
this isn't quite what can it technically

00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:46,310
do but what does my idea afford and it's

00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,250
a much more nuanced decision so let's

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:52,520
talk about this in code when we're in

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:57,710
code you know I I don't know you guys I

00:25:52,520 --> 00:26:01,700
tend to I do most of my work with traits

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:04,520
and unimplemented functions before I

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:09,440
ever write any line of executable code

00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,910
and the reason for that is what this

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,550
looks like in terms of the creative

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,530
process here is I'm taking the ideas

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:19,580
there in my mind we're starting to

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:22,100
solidify a jint a general structure or a

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,860
path we're solidifying that into

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,290
something that might be a solution right

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,630
but what we want to do here is we want

00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:32,360
to figure out is this really what I want

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,940
and what does it afford I want to figure

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,650
that out pretty quickly because if it

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,390
doesn't afford the things that I want if

00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,820
it's not quite right I want to either

00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,470
scrap it or refine it as quickly as I

00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:46,190
can

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:50,030
so unimplemented Macko macro for me this

00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:52,690
is like the most commonly used macro in

00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:56,240
my code I use this everywhere

00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,770
unimplemented or just define a tree

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,890
right maybe it'll be a concrete type

00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:02,000
later I don't know but just to find a

00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,610
trait don't worry about the

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,340
implementation but be able to see what

00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:10,700
my design is going to afford so this

00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:13,790
clearly affords shooting the moon which

00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,070
is something that I'd love to do but you

00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:18,560
can also think about you know maybe rust

00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:22,340
strings as an example okay rust strings

00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,560
afford slicing this is a really useful

00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,440
thing and so if you want to solve your

00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,720
problem with slices if slices are going

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,080
to be useful to you then you want to

00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:37,400
just give yourself an API that affords

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:40,460
the kind of things that you want now the

00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,860
other part of this is that again right

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:46,190
this needs to be innovative and useful

00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:49,560
in order to really be what we are after

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:52,800
and again

00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,390
we're circling back to ideation right so

00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm gonna decide well this isn't quite

00:27:54,390 --> 00:28:00,990
right I want to change it a little bit

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,840
refine it go back and forth to do that I

00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:06,750
need to decide whether or not this is

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,120
going to be considered a failure and I

00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:12,570
use the term failure pretty lightly

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,000
right in code it is pretty light you

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,510
know maybe not maybe most of this is

00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,020
fine but it's just missing a semicolon

00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:24,210
MBD but maybe I just need to add a few

00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,920
few functions change few signatures

00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:29,100
adjust things here and there

00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,700
either way this requires me personally

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:37,770
to say this isn't right and that could

00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:41,010
be hard so failure

00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:43,320
I think it's an unavoidable part of the

00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,530
creative process and if we want to be

00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,990
creative we have to get better at

00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:52,740
accepting failure I'm going to tell you

00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:55,320
guys a real quick story from when I was

00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,990
studying art I came in one day and I

00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:01,110
turned in a painting and it wasn't very

00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:03,600
good and my art teacher you could see it

00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,910
on my face right I came in I like didn't

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:12,000
even want to show it to him like this is

00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:15,000
a turd and and you know he told me look

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,860
you gotta adjust your expectations he

00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,320
said I can see that you know you want to

00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,780
really be successful as an artist and

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,660
I'm gonna tell you what that means he

00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:27,800
said what that means is that if you work

00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,780
very very hard and you're very talented

00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,790
that one in every seven of your

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:36,690
paintings is gonna be something that you

00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:39,630
actually feel good about that think

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:43,590
about that that's huge six failures for

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:47,400
every success and and this was you know

00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:50,550
words from a professional artist and so

00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:54,090
this is like the key thing that I think

00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:58,410
we can learn as developers from creative

00:29:54,090 --> 00:30:01,520
fields is that I had to learn how to

00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:05,420
fail and this is a

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,400
huge huge thing for me in being a

00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:10,190
developer right I learned how to fail so

00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,340
failure is not a big deal that allows me

00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:16,790
to call those ideas pretty quickly I can

00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:19,670
I can be ruthless in evaluating my own

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:24,280
ideas because the risk to me isn't as

00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:28,280
great there's a great book about this

00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,800
called art and fear and if you're

00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,350
interested in the topic I definitely

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,620
recommend it it's real short but it

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:40,100
talks about that aspect of how do I deal

00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,050
with my own creative failures and if it

00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:46,610
helps you know you can always cross how

00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:48,590
art and write software so that's all I

00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,600
have I hope for you guys that this was

00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:53,600
helpful and that you feel empowered to

00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,330
go out and be more creative and if

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,820
there's a question or anything that you

00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:03,460
