um so hi I'm Ashley Williams I'm a

00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,290
little horse j/s today because I do a

00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,360
lot of JavaScript and also I was

00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,040
teaching all day I'm gonna be showing

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,580
you off a project that I worked on with

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,800
Steve back there called simple server

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,929
and the reason I wanted to create simple

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,460
server is because I'm a teacher and so I

00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:25,839
invented this program called node

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,569
together and note together as an

00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,849
introduction to node for absolute

00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:32,110
beginners and so it kind of ends up

00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:33,730
looking like this and it's focused on

00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,370
getting underrepresented people in tech

00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,199
up and running in a cool ecosystem and

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,940
so we used to write this program and the

00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:41,649
program is called emergency complement

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,260
which looks a little bit like this you

00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:45,370
get a cat and you get a compliment

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,219
assuming that the Wi-Fi works we might

00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,410
be stuck with just this one and so I

00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,910
wanted to be able to do this in rust and

00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,379
I started doing this in rust and I was

00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,390
using a framework called pencil and then

00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:58,030
unfortunately as sometimes happens the

00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,460
maintainer pieced and it turned out that

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,170
it was no longer in a good spot that we

00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,390
could possibly be able to use it for the

00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,060
program and so I was like hey why don't

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,520
we take a look at what needs to happen

00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,340
to create a node server let's take that

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
exact API throw it into a rust program

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,190
and then build out whatever we have to

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,260
do in the back so that we can have this

00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,540
API because this is an API that I can

00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,070
teach the beginners in one day you'd be

00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,470
surprised how little you can teach in a

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,390
single day so we released this about a

00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,280
week two weeks ago and it got the

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,230
attention of node people which was

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,640
particularly awesome so you can see here

00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,770
guillermo rauch is really big michael

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,210
rogers the former community manager of

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,490
node so that the fact the language

00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,440
aiming to replace C++ is this expressive

00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,320
and concise should make everyone take

00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,760
notice which is super super cool but

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,640
additionally my favorite part is it got

00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,160
beginners excited and so yesterday I was

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,710
hoarse because we was teaching rust rust

00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,190
belt rust rust bridge and so I am going

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:56,440
to show you a small portion of the rust

00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,300
emergency complement app and I am going

00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,200
to do it as fast as I frickin possibly

00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,880
can

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,370
fYI if you're looking for the rest

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,670
bridge website it's right here and

00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:09,039
please check that out and just as an FYI

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,840
the default port for this is seven eight

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,580
seven eight because that's how you spell

00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,310
rust on a telephone and I always have to

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,630
google it

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,550
all right so we're gonna start doing

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,739
some typing now so excellent create

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:25,400
simple server simple server is the name

00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:27,770
of this we're going to use simple server

00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,130
I'm so bad at typing and my hands are

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:33,709
like shaking so this is really fun yeah

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,239
so they won't do a function main all

00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,190
right and so we're gonna set a host

00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,230
there's currently a lot of people on the

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,660
internet who are mad that this is string

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,819
ly typed and I love that the interface

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:48,620
is simple so I don't really care what

00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:50,630
they think so we're just creating a host

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,299
and a port and now we are going to

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:56,480
create our server using the simple

00:02:53,299 --> 00:03:00,230
server server struct and this Struck's

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,720
new takes a closure and that closure

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:06,530
takes a request in a mutable response

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,849
and then we could log that request but

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,950
we're not going to instead we're going

00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:11,480
to make a message and yesterday I

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,690
discovered thanks to the awesome

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,750
students in Russ bridge that the marquee

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:22,989
tag still works so we're gonna do that

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:26,810
oh gosh type type type I can do this

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:32,359
HTML why are you so hard to type hello

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:33,620
rust builds rust alright and so this is

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:35,989
going to be our message that we're gonna

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,019
send if you see missing semicolons

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:41,630
please tell me I love that and so we

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:46,060
were Sallee they passed the message into

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:51,470
our body and we have to do it as bites

00:03:46,060 --> 00:04:00,019
and we return that and then lastly yes

00:03:51,470 --> 00:04:05,060
oh gosh yes danke server dot listen on

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:08,690
our host and our port and we can save

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:13,190
that and cargo run and see if the

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:15,680
compiler is mad at us oh I see what it

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:21,650
is the question mark

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:25,370
here there we go

00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:31,270
it's running and now I can go over here

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,270
and although Russ

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,250
mother slowed the Marquis it's really

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,910
dramatic

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,910
