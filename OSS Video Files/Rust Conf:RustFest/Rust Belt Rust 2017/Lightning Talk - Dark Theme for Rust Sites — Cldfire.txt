hi I'm cold fire without the Oh let me

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,400
start my fire and I like rust and one of

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,370
the projects that I've done in rust is a

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,330
dark theme for various rust websites so

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:21,090
if I can do this this is the github page

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,619
for that and I think one of the really

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,939
interesting things about this is that it

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,160
ties into the talk that we heard earlier

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,630
today about creativity so one of the

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,029
ways that you could be creative is to

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,980
theme and style your dev tools and one

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,420
of the best ways to do that is to theme

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,540
the documentation that you take a look

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,130
at all the time and all day and by the

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,989
way this is based off of a sublime text

00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,600
3 thing that you can see the repple over

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,370
there so this is what it looks like and

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,050
one of the nice things about doing these

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,030
projects is that it's risk-free

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,230
creativity as long as you don't look at

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,450
the CSS behind it so one of the things

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,789
that you'll notice about this theme is

00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,890
that it is a very brightly vibrantly

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,899
colored dark theme and that the inline

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,250
code stands out quite strongly which is

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,560
a feature that I really like because it

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:11,689
makes it easy to read and over here you

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:17,540
can see the documentation for vech vech

00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:20,640
documentation and then we can move on to

00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,080
Docs to our s and Docs letter s I think

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,299
we all know what that is that is a site

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,310
that generates documentation for all

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,490
kinds of crates and you can quickly go

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,780
and access that documentation and

00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,700
another thing that I try to do is really

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,380
care about the details of the theme that

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,360
I'm working on so like you can see here

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,310
the about page for docs that are s I

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,920
tried to make look good as well as the

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,939
releases page so the graph isn't white I

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,930
tried to style that and over here you

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,600
can see crates tayo

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,280
I've teamed crates tayo as well and you

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,920
can see for instance the rammed crate

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,750
here which if we scroll down thanks to

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,130
this tiny resolution you can see a

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,229
little bit of that I haven't fixed the

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,070
syntax highlighting on this page yet but

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:05,520
it's still nice dark theme and then over

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,890
here we have play rustling org so I

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,929
think the code editor and over here you

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,480
can see some code that my friends wrote

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,380
which is full of nice ugly iterator

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,480
goodness because they like iterators

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,860
this is by the way an example of a place

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,590
where you would not want to use

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,350
iterators this is for for loops and then

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,880
over here we have rust by example so

00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,550
steve clad nick who is somewhere here

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,310
recently ported rust by example to the

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,260
md book thing that is used for the rust

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,930
book as well and you can actually go

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,910
over here and click on i you and you'll

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,530
see the IU theme is built into MD book

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,090
now I contributed that a few months back

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,570
and you'll actually be able to use it on

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,530
the rust books next stable and then over

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,530
