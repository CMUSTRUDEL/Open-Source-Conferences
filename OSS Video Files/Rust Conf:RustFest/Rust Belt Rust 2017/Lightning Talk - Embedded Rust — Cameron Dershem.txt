hello I'm Cameron Durham you can find me

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,259
on the Internet's at pink hat beard comm

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,150
that's pink hat beard comm I'm also

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,860
known in the rusk unity now as the man

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,770
of two scarfs as of this morning I'm

00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,009
trying to trying to bring that one back

00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,930
back

00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:24,239
apparently so I'm a software developer

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,399
who a couple years ago a year and a half

00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,980
ago started a hardware company with a

00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,200
couple of friends and that was a really

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,840
really good idea because I don't know

00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,040
anything in C or systems-level things we

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,800
wrote everything in Python because that

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,050
makes sense and eventually we figured

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,480
out something which was the Python might

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,820
not be the answer for everything and so

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,470
I decided I was gonna learn a real a

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,480
real programming language on descripting

00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,770
stuff and I was gonna learn C and I went

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,579
and found a book that everyone

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,579
recommended for C and I found rust and

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,720
so I've been doing rust for a little bit

00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,840
and I have yet to actually write

00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,909
anything that means anything really

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,350
except for a little bit of hardware

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,060
stuff because I don't like to do

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,720
anything the easy way I decide that hey

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,460
I will try to write hardware stuff with

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,729
rust before I've actually written like a

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,720
website or anything with rust I make a

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,780
lot of decisions that are great like

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,150
that so there is a gentleman or a person

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,280
I don't I don't know anything about them

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,260
other than their github handle who's

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,330
written a book recently called discovery

00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:35,820
it is all about making this thing work

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:37,830
which this is a stm32f4 ditz got it's a

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,080
dev board it cost $15 if you order it

00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,000
from China and take a month to get it or

00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,820
it's like $30 if you order off Amazon to

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,380
get it in a week but so what's cool

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,229
about this is this is rust running on

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,909
bare metal so it is running bare metal

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,200
it's blinking some LEDs which is not

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,340
that cool until you find out that it's

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,330
doing that asynchronously

00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,780
so if I type some words here and then I

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:04,619
type them incorrectly we will reset it

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,399
so that we can type them correctly you

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,110
will see that this should start blinking

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,849
the opposite direction and there was no

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,130
delay there which means it's happening

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,310
asynchronously it's beautiful

00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,570
so the reason I'm giving this talk is

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,170
because yesterday I said I was

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:25,980
interested in what oh yeah whatever it's

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,090
it's $15 right so the reason I'm giving

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,380
this talk is because yesterday I

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,550
mentioned I was into embedded things and

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,110
people started coming up to me asking me

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,930
questions as if I were some type of

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,610
authority in rust and embedded things

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,380
and so I decided I would do a lightning

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,130
talk about how I don't know anything

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,480
about rust and embedded because I think

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,950
that that's probably the same as

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,410
everyone else in the world with rust and

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,870
embedded stuff it's being kind of made

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,160
up as we go there are actually so to

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,010
answer a couple questions I kept getting

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,450
there is at least two projects that are

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,430
operating system real-time operating

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,470
systems in rust one of them is made by

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,270
the same guy who did this you can see

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,840
the github handle here I will try to

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:08,870
make that bigger so you can find this

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,840
book also so he has one

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:15,990
rtos called RTFM as in real time for the

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,240
masses not as on the other meanings and

00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,920
so that's one operating system there's

00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,570
also another operating system called Tok

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,980
OS that's being worked on but there's

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,410
also a lot of work working on just

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,710
getting bare metal and there is someone

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,080
here who is working on AVR supports

00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:36,600
which is so you can compile stuff and

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,610
get it on an Arduino but like I said I

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,160
have no idea any of that works and so I

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,860
would really like is if someone wanted

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,260
to help maybe mentor me I think that'd

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,520
be pretty awesome and maybe we could do

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,990
a couple of things for embedded in the

00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,460
imple period because there's currently

00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,650
as far as I can tell no working group

00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,650
for any embedded things we can make some

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,320
magic happen there mainly I really want

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,180
to write an LLVM back-end to get

00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,830
extensive support which would mean that

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,330
you could use a three dollar chip to do

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:09,060
amazing this because cheaper is better

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,650
than $15 yeah so that's pretty much

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,930
everything like I said you can find me

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,930
