so yeah there's this ancient debate

00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,570
between mathematicians and basically

00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:16,599
everybody else whether one equals 0.99

00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,730
etc and I hope to convince you that it

00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,470
actually equals each other in three

00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,029
minutes or less the reason why I'm

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,249
aiming for three minutes or less is that

00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:26,679
maybe need some counseling to do

00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:28,449
afterwards if you have math anxiety so

00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:32,079
if you feel any dizziness or shakiness

00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:34,239
come see me afterwards so the reason or

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,840
the most arms you are is it's almost

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,379
quite one but not quite one it tends to

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,019
be one but not quite one there's a small

00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:46,269
difference at the end of all these nines

00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:49,539
no it's just equal one and let's see why

00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:50,859
so let's talk about fractions does

00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:54,820
anybody know the fraction for this

00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:56,920
number one over two sorry that's one

00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,519
over two correctly but why is that one

00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,920
over two

00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:04,120
cuz I already know I've got still four

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,379
months left I guess let's examine why to

00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,370
look at them different sample so does

00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:09,910
anybody know the fraction for this

00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:12,580
number no okay so why do you know that

00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,650
is two so let's examine that so let's

00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,230
name it name it axe because let's face

00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,970
mathematicians love to call things X if

00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,700
you multiply X with hundred you get

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,920
thirty seven and if you divide that you

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,920
get X and also the fraction for that so

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,050
this is reasonable isn't it yeah so so

00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,400
let's let's get a tougher question for

00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,720
the people who shouted out the last

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,860
fraction what's the fraction for this

00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:40,300
number yeah so so I just told you an

00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,130
algorithm so let's follow the algorithm

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,570
if you call things and axe because let's

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,430
face it mathematicians love to call

00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,290
things axe now you multiply by hunger

00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,060
just by shifting that you see that are

00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,990
still left over if you need to work with

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,060
but remember X was the 37 37 7 so if we

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,980
subtract those on the left side you get

00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,070
99 X and on the right side the till just

00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,290
disappears as you get 99 axis 37

00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,470
so the fraction for that is ladies have

00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,619
99th so let's do this for the other

00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,780
number or interested in 0.99 and a 9 so

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,610
let's call this X because let's face it

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:16,300
mathematics like like to call things X

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,080
if you multiply by 10 the decimal point

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,240
shifts my point

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,280
until left over again you know something

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,800
that this is a till if you subtract

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,260
those things 9 times X is 9 if you

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,490
divide those you get 1 so I hope you all

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,640
agree now that 99 9 equals 1 and thank

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,640
