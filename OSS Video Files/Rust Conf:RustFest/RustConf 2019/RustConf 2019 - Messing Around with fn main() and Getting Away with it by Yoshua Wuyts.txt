	RustConf 2019 - Messing Around with FN Main() and Getting Away with it by Yoshua Wuyts

The introduction of return types in main has made writing binaries a lot nicer. But why stop there? What if we could make main an async fn to support top-level await? Or perhaps allow main to take command line arguments as parameters?

In this talk I’ll show how to make fn main perform party tricks, make boilerplate disappear, and saw code size in half. And by the end of the show you’ll have a good picture to take home of what Rust might look like in the future.

[Music]

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,800
hello I'm Yosh this is my talk

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,380
it's called messing around with Maine

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,050
and getting away with it now Who am I I

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,890
am Yosh like I said like Suns already

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,170
said so it's three times I guess I'm a

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:38,270
research engineer which means I guess I

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:40,340
do open source anyway oh yeah background

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,960
I used to do like loads of JavaScript I

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,379
did I look for like five years published

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,960
like things on NPM a lot and then I

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:50,809
moved to rust like two years ago

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,920
I like economics I guess it's the is the

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:54,199
main thing that I want to share there

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,229
anyway introducing the main characters

00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:59,750
of today's talk because it's not me it's

00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:04,519
not function man it's actually this guy

00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:07,520
over here name's Joshua another cat it's

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,750
naughty and because this is a rest talk

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,940
you know we need to introduce some

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:15,770
concurrency some parallelism so here

00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:18,740
they are together all right okay cool so

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:21,800
why are we giving this talk well first

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,410
off my refseq of my proposal got

00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,820
accepted which means that no organisers

00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:30,350
were like okay we think you can give a

00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:35,120
talk but I was surprised though it's

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:36,320
like I like function main and in

00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,810
JavaScript you don't really have

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,400
function man you just add a pragmatic to

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,810
the top of a file and you execute that

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,150
file and it's like oh cool that works

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,100
but you know a roast wavefunction man

00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,510
it's like a clear defined entry point

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,210
into your program I think that's very

00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:53,120
cool I think when we added the result to

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,680
it that was a nice addition um I was

00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,210
like thinking hey what other things can

00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,370
we like - I like your wax I like it you

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,460
know people also call this urban onyx or

00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,980
like developer experience I think that's

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,509
nice I think if if we provide a nice way

00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,280
for people to use things then they'll

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:12,260
tend to use it and fewer mistakes are

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,800
made and we all have a little bit more

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,750
fun oh yeah third one is sharing ideas I

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,610
have a bunch of ideas I've got a stage

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,959
so sharing ideas that's what I'm getting

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:25,579
this stuff cool so let's pretend we're

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,150
all like time travelers I'm gonna fast

00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:32,120
forward to the year 2021 we have a new

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,640
addition out and we're gonna write

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,200
function main for a little HTTP server

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,840
that we're building so well we started

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,849
off with a function main you know you

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,650
know this one because we're building an

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:47,690
HTTP server and with some concurrency

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,310
it's gonna be a async function main you

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,739
can't call a wait without a sync so you

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,120
know it's a sing function man also we

00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,370
need to handle errors we're not sure

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,290
quite what kind of errors so we just say

00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,069
hey this thing throws if you're familiar

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,310
with Java

00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,780
it's like checked up session exceptions

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,850
sweet a little common because we're like

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,760
good citizens we say started HTTP server

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,830
then you know we need input to our

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,590
applications or going to find some input

00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,709
arguments args of type args which we're

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,390
defining out there you know well it's HP

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:20,420
server so we need a port we need an

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:22,519
address and I always say cool let's turn

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,860
this into CLI so we derive something

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,489
from crates i/o which implements CLI so

00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,049
wait it's cool

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:32,239
then we're like hopefully tied still

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:34,459
around I know but yeah we're gonna build

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,880
a low HP server say I create a new tied

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,980
app and I'm on the on the route slash

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,799
for the methods it just be method get

00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,400
we're gonna say hello world man that's

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,920
pretty nice

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,780
and then we say start this thing on the

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,730
address and the port and we await it

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,090
which is fallible and then this thing

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,690
goes

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,630
that's a HTTP server in ten lines it's

00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:00,260
pretty good for a scene competitor might

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,790
say oh I forgot about this one but you

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,319
know we need to start logging so you

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,389
know let's let's add some logging to

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,359
this thing wait okay cool let's run this

00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:10,700
with a little help output and we'll

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:12,680
probably look something like this pretty

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,420
basic but pretty good it's kind of what

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,769
you want I don't feel like run a itself

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,660
we say listen on port 8080 localhost

00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:24,440
you get listening on localhost 8080 and

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,030
the things now running sweet alright so

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,250
for today what we're gonna do is we're

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,740
gonna go over how do you get to async

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,610
function main how do you get main arcs

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,910
like args amen

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,440
and finally improving errors in main or

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,240
as I like to say we have three main

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,800
courses

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,660
no joke they're happy Oh laughs all

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:53,100
right let's write function man likes

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:56,610
2021 in 2019 sorta and also we're using

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,710
proc macros procedural macros if you're

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,350
familiar with the word you might be like

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,290
oh yeah so I'm sorry I'm sorry through

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,980
everyone who knows what this means all

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,790
right

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:11,010
act 1 async all right so how do you do

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,260
this today the async function main well

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,330
you don't but you define a function main

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:19,070
Oh under server I should preface this on

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:22,440
this server which is native or whatever

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,030
you get a little executor in this case

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,420
we're using async stood which came out

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,460
last week let me say block on and inside

00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,220
of it would put a sink closure so what

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,100
happens here is you need something to

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,560
execute the async code all the futures

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,210
and stuff and at the top level you know

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,530
you mess it all the way down but top

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,080
levels something needs to be running

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,990
this in this case block on it runs all

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,510
that async code until it's done at

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,310
blocks until it's done inside of it

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,290
we're gonna say hello Joshua

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,200
which we met a bit earlier we're gonna

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:58,320
sleep the sleep to task for one second

00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,780
we'll wait it and under it I'm gonna say

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,910
hello naughty now I want you to just

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,350
take a split second here to be like okay

00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,020
what's what's the ordering in which

00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:09,960
these things get printed cool let's

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,150
write C so we run this thing we say

00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,040
first comes hello Joshua then comes

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,400
hello naughty so this one came first

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,020
this one came second cool all right now

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,130
let's let's do the same thing for the

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,280
browser all right

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,410
so we have a function main we can't use

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,060
a 6th ed quite yet so we use a wise and

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,490
bunch and futures and their spawn local

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,410
I would say spawn local we give it a

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,380
sync closure we say hello Joshua

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:37,170
we sleep the task for like one second

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,980
again and then we say hello naughty now

00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:43,740
again like what's the ordering here

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,330
that's C well hey oh hey I forgot about

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,710
this alright in order to like make this

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,730
make this work you actually need to do a

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,650
pub function main

00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,920
and likewise invitin start there's an

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,640
actual code that will

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:57,040
actually work if you use this I hope so

00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,670
to run this you know awesome example

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,290
hello naughty hello Joshua yeah that's

00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,790
not super because it means that this

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,600
one's running first and this one's

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,730
running second

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,830
and the reason for that is because we're

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,240
not in control of the executor in the

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,030
browser because we're hooking into

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,980
JavaScript promises and promises are

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,570
invocate immediately which means that

00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,670
spawn local essentially kicks off a

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,740
background task as queued for a next

00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:23,560
take on the event loop and print line

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,660
nor or hello naughty is printed

00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,370
immediately right sirs differences

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,830
between how it works in the browser and

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,420
how it works on servers were difference

00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,620
in control and there's like more

00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:37,140
environments where these differences

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:40,180
exist so a solution to this would be

00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,010
where you can't get it wrong is if we

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,440
had something like async function main

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:46,870
in which we can just say hey sleep for

00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,720
one sec then we say hello Joshua hello

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,020
naughty there's no more a question of

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:56,110
ordering and a way we can make this

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,470
happen today is using runtime which is

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm not sure if you should be using this

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,460
but it works you can add a little

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,650
attribute to the top which just says

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,360
like it is async function main and we

00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,490
have a PR out we're not smart to forget

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,140
that actually makes this work on both

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,880
the server and in the browser

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,250
removing the differences which is kind

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,160
of cool so yeah that's that's the first

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,380
one I was second one right go chapter

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,260
two arguments how do we get arguments in

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,630
main well um little primer on what

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:28,090
arguments are I like to think of them as

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,250
input to your application right so you

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,530
boot up your app and like it gets

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,420
arguments it gets input from somewhere

00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,860
so a classic one is for command line

00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,110
apps you have your command line

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,060
arguments but also if you're running

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,740
stuff again in a browser what you might

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,320
actually have is URLs like query

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,810
parameter like stuff on window navigator

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,550
that is like initial state but you need

00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,920
to read out before you can boot up your

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:54,210
application or someone's inlining JSON

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,980
and your HTML header and like whatever

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,730
but you know there's an initial status

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,720
thing another one's like serverless apps

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,180
which might have an incoming request

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,710
that's the thing that's like given to it

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,140
my boot

00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:10,290
up and has like some form of output at

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,060
the end again so arguments today how

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,590
would you go about writing a little

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,410
command line app probably something like

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,720
this little function man let me say stay

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,600
down you know the N marks so we get the

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,740
arguments and I only say for Argan args

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,910
let's print the Arg cool sweet well not

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,920
really that's not really how you do

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,290
things that's that's the the pretty

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,260
example the actual example with probably

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,330
you know look a bit more like this you

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,520
know it's a function man we got sedan

00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,650
mugs again you know and instead of like

00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,360
iterating over it nicely oops it needs

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,830
to be mutable also we need to skip the

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,560
first one because those are self you

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,960
know then we get the next one oh we're

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,660
building HTP server again by the way we

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,940
get the address out Oh unwrapped or

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,490
Hanalei or somehow cool let's get the

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,150
port that is next on the wrap parse

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,440
unwrapped alright that's not that great

00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,630
so in practice people don't really do

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,960
that they tend to use struct opt more

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,280
likely or clap which is similar sorry

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,590
you know you define a little struct you

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,660
say like hey I want to port you 16 I

00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,540
want to address which is string then we

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,810
derive struct opt on it and then we say

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,390
4 - P or - - port is that one instead of

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:25,830
like positional - a or - - address is

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:27,060
the other one you know I really like

00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:32,430
that can just like click to the next

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:34,680
line yeah and then like the way we

00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,840
instantiate this and we say like we get

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,820
the struct which now implements a from

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,520
args argument that you need to know

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,860
about there's a few others which I've

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,410
never used then you say Argos remarks

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,070
and then we get that which means in

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,840
either instantiates or panics you know

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:54,170
is they like the questionnaire is like

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,880
is it clear that we are instantiating

00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:00,390
application input I don't think so

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,430
so arguments of tomorrow a better way of

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,440
doing this I think would be if we

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,590
followed what oh I have a double slider

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,050
if we follow what C does with Arg C and

00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,550
argue but instead of like doing those

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,740
which is only for iterating we could

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,910
just put arbitrary like structs in it as

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,620
long as they implement some sort of

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,330
trait into the main position

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,970
can do the parsing for us so in this

00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:27,010
case we would be able to define args and

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:29,350
args like and it if as long as it parses

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,850
we get the actual instantiation so it's

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,230
cool from from there on out we can look

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,630
assume that the states correctly be

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,960
initialized wait so how can we make this

00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:41,500
happen today is using a little attribute

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,330
called pas main from a critical path I

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,870
would not recommend you use this in

00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,970
production but definitely try it out so

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,270
you have like parrot-like async code

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:54,790
things go horribly wrong tried to fix

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:56,860
they can fix it anyway yeah this is

00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,160
pretty fun like try it out it actually

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:03,250
works works like this you able to see it

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:10,750
which I think's putting this yeah so

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:12,430
arguments of tomorrow is for service you

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,620
know we were talking about like a server

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,640
list how would this work so it is a

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,810
function main

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,120
let's async we get an incoming event so

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,040
this this app is like boot like

00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,290
triggered started whenever there's an

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,870
event incoming in this case its type

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,820
string then we say cool we're gonna

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,010
print it out and like return it it's

00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,100
like a little fallible signature there

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:40,480
we say okay event then we add a lambda

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,120
lambda in the case of AWS so this is not

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,000
even too far out because actually

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,560
there's OPR under arrest lens at runtime

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,240
and they were like oh paw is pretty

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,850
sweet like we want this for our thing

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,420
and you know it's pretty cool so yeah

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,420
it's definitely possible

00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:04,030
yes great okay cool let's ignore that

00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:06,730
let's get to earth all right Eris cool

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:12,670
so a quick little primer again for what

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:14,260
are errors there's a there's two kinds

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,620
of errors I like to think about

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,570
there's the errors you can handle which

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,190
I like to refer to as exceptions they're

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,230
the result or type

00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,360
and there's the errors you can't really

00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:28,210
handle which are the panic types which

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,820
are invoked through panic and they they

00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,860
tend to crash your app there's some edge

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,090
cases around threads and whether or not

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,830
that should like crush your app but

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,870
let's just assume it crashes your app

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:41,610
right cool

00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:44,800
so today there's a little thing about oh

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,190
is this okay mess up my slides I'm not

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:53,050
sure I think I messed up my slides here

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:55,500
alright so okay rapping I think this is

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,150
supposed to be catch-all but whatever

00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,580
alright so we start off with async

00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:03,430
function main which returns a results

00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,020
and it's gonna return some form of some

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,910
form of error which we're going to find

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,800
it a bit we just say is type exception

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,200
all right the inside of it we're gonna

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,750
do two things we have a get cat method

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,200
which queries an API somewhere to get a

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:19,960
cat we wrapped it in debug before I

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,760
forget why and we have another method

00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,130
called process cat which may or may not

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,500
do some sort of like I owe my do

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,390
Sabretooth database I'm not sure right

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,190
we we don't really know we're just

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,110
looking at this at this method we have

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,470
these two these two methods that were

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:38,200
like trying to do something with they're

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,640
both async they're both fallible and we

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,590
don't really know what the what the

00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,110
error type here is right we just see

00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,000
like oh it returns a result of something

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,440
and the other one probably returns a

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,180
different result so what we actually

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,970
want to have is we're going to have an

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,340
error type in our top level that can

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,050
like abstract over both of them where we

00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,240
don't need to choose one but we just you

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:01,150
know like it's an error sweet let's

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,620
propagate it so the way we would define

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:07,250
this today is by oh and we're missing a

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,329
little little okay of

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:13,129
unit at the end which is very common so

00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:15,610
the way we would define us today is we

00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:20,269
would define a little arrow type up top

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:21,529
with which is din error then stood error

00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,759
error I didn't want to type it out it

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,769
didn't fail in the slide so just in

00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,680
there we need to box it so I'm going to

00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:30,529
turn into a pointer because it's async

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,720
code we need to add a send bound we also

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,629
need to add a sync bound unfortunately

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,579
and we need to make sure it doesn't

00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:40,160
borrow so it needs to be a static

00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:41,750
lifetime all right that's pretty verbose

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,279
and if you're new to rust or need to

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,629
async rest you're like whoa I need to

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,720
type that out every single time it's

00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:50,899
like yeah or reuse it somehow but it's

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:54,259
not built-in so that's not great so

00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:55,910
challenges yes okay fix the slide catch

00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:57,529
all exceptions that's that's that's one

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:03,230
challenge right next challenge

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:05,180
okay wrapping alright so yeah like I

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,819
said earlier as we need we need this

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,579
little this little thing here at the end

00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:15,649
okay of type unit and that's not great

00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:17,769
when we're like writing like infallible

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:21,139
code code that doesn't return results

00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:22,819
the the return type is always unit and I

00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,990
was like assume that is unit so we don't

00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:25,519
need to write it out we don't need to

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,079
write it out signature we don't need to

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,420
add to the end of the line it's just

00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,519
like a it's unit whatever but if it

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,309
becomes fallible right then we need to

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,980
write a result type like you can see up

00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:39,920
there and also like write it into into

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,870
our return type so you know a one-liner

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,360
might become like a two liner for sure

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,769
and like in this case we have a method

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,230
that's actually supposed to be like two

00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:51,949
lines but we need to add that okay of

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:54,079
that thing at the end it's not super and

00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:55,279
so another one is okay wrapping that's

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,100
that's a bit of a challenge these days

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:04,730
it's it's a little work there so finally

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:07,220
is exception contacts so in this case if

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,689
we have a panic Kotick and panic you

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,280
know for example a function man just

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,429
panics with oops and when you run this

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,110
it will look something like this you

00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:19,539
know it says thread man panic that oops

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:23,350
source may in our ass

00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:25,329
line six in there or whatever the sides

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:27,100
I don't know what it's called and then

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,260
then we get a back-trace a list of

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,179
reasons how we got there it's not so

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,760
it's not always like the nicest to look

00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:35,679
at but definitely if you're like digging

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,690
in you're like okay I can find what

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,730
actually went wrong here so you got

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,909
location which is important and you get

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:45,690
a list of reasons now if we were to like

00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:46,899
run a previous code an error occurred

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,760
right

00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:53,159
it doesn't panic it might look something

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,960
like this it's like oh we got an error

00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:58,149
socket hang out cool did this happen

00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,740
when we had like an incoming request did

00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:02,289
this happen when we had like an outgoing

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:07,450
requests where is this happening right

00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:10,389
so yeah it's not super so that's not a

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,539
challenge era context so in the errors

00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:16,510
of tomorrow what would be nice is if we

00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:19,899
could get rid of this if we can also

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:22,720
like get rid of this a way to do this

00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:25,059
might be to have a type of stood error

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,840
exception but we don't instead what

00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:30,669
we're proposing is throws right so we

00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,169
add a little keyword which removes the

00:18:30,669 --> 00:18:34,240
need for okay wrapping which allows you

00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:35,980
to use throw which we're not showing

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,809
here inside the function body to

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,700
propagate errors question mark keeps on

00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:43,059
working but we get rid of the okay

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,419
wrapping also after throws you could do

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:48,309
an error type to specify like a it

00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:49,929
throws this error but if you omit it it

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:54,580
just says like cool it's a boxed in

00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:56,440
error send saying static you know that's

00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,990
kind of nice also what we would want

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,480
probably is if instead of like that

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,220
little error socket hang-up we could get

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,090
something a little bit closer like this

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,230
it says like hey the socket hung up

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:11,110
because while we were performing a get

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,870
request while we were getting a cat from

00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:16,179
the API and starting our HTTP server so

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,130
you're like oh sweet I kind of get where

00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:19,870
this arrow came from and like you can

00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,370
also see a location there's a little

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,080
macro in the standard lit to just

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:26,500
statically inject the location of where

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,690
something is so surf one-off cool we're

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,399
using surf fair and then like I went

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,870
into Maine alright sweet I know I know

00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:33,580
where this error came from and like I

00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,430
can start figuring out

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,220
why it is this happening so you get

00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:41,560
location and you lists the reasons right

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,860
so how can we make this this happened

00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:48,940
today whoops

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:51,610
you can't well you really would want is

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,450
if this was possible and we have a

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,190
little gist

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,650
somewhere I hacked something together

00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,390
with like try functions in the block and

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,960
like proc macros to make this work

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:06,220
it's not usable this really someone

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,050
someone should just like build that so

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,050
yeah if you're looking for side projects

00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:13,000
please do anyway

00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,520
what we can do so we come to the throws

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,520
thing what we can do today is using

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,410
arrow contacts so the in failure there's

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,720
a thing called result X which allows you

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:25,630
to add context to an error which looks

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,870
kind of like this so say our error dot

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:31,420
context whew wait did that mess around a

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,310
wait and question mark no turfy

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,020
orderings exactly right here but the

00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:38,410
idea is you say doc context on your

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,820
result type and I new add a little

00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,490
message like hey we're trying to get a

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:46,030
cat from the API but what we're doing

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:49,060
here is we're using it at the time of

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,740
our what do we call it but but but at

00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,720
the time that we're calling it what we

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,400
really want is like sorta inside of the

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,330
function definition inside the function

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,950
body so yeah it should actually part of

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,410
Kali it'd be nicer if that was like

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,260
there yeah anyway

00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:08,770
Eric context tomorrow what can we do

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:11,350
here is now imagine the little get cat

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,700
function we would probably define it

00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,800
something like this where you say hey it

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,200
returns a string it's called get cat

00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,330
it's an async function inside of it

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,190
we're gonna call an HTTP client this

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,540
case we're using Cerf give it a little

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:26,890
URL we say get something from the API

00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,930
gives us back a cat's truck that we're

00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,790
like destructuring into just the name

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,100
value because that's the only thing we

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,870
care about and we await it now look at

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,150
this function it's like if we're

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,400
wondering like what does this do then

00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,590
actually it's pretty easy to see because

00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,360
we have a little comment up there that

00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,670
says hey this thing gets a cat from the

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,620
API so it would be really nice if we

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,870
could do

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,150
would be if we could just define it like

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,400
this where you say like hey what's the

00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,990
context for dysfunction it's just the DA

00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:00,179
comment up there which says get a cat

00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:02,220
from the API this works today so instead

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,100
of like writing all that all that dot

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,169
context code with failure and whatnot

00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,190
you can use this thing which will have

00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:11,520
that for you

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,870
using just comments yeah it's called

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,270
context attribute you can get from

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:20,120
Crites io I think this one's reasonably

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:20,120
solid it will not break your code I hope

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:28,980
anyway in conclusion rounding out this

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:32,820
talk is you can write this function main

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:35,659
that we saw here easily just by doing

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,100
this today

00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:41,460
please don't also tries doesn't work but

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,950
I know please like something to look

00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,539
forward to if you're interested in how

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,100
we made all these things work they're

00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,450
all like available and crates i/o and

00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,490
the codes open so you can like look

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,470
through them but most importantly if you

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,179
want to define your own proc macros and

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,970
play around with stuff check out the

00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:00,120
sink rate the quote crate that work

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:05,010
together and ace the Explorer done that

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:07,950
which has a wasm version of the parser

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,690
and a ste Walker for Russ which is super

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,070
nice because you just put your rest code

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,990
in there like shows you the AC

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,370
definition for your rest code which is

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,500
super useful if you're like getting into

00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,330
this so yeah all right

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,649
final note from Cheshire naughty we said

00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,659
they were two main characters they kind

00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:24,570
of took a backseat sorry but they're

00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:27,059
back here so you know just just got a

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,630
gonna have them say hi was Joshua

00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:29,630
skateboard

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:42,049
and here's a here's a here's an OT going

00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:45,870
down the slide alright thanks so much

00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:46,280
you can find me here on Twitter get up

00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,040
whatever

00:23:46,280 --> 00:24:00,339
[Applause]
