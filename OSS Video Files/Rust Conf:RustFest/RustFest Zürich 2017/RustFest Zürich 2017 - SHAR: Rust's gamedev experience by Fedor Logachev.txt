Description: 
	SHAR is the 3d multiplayer action game. I am going to talk about its internal implementation details and about problems and challenges met during development.

I’ll give a quick overview of all components SHAR is using - GUI, animations, FXses, networking, data serialization, modding.

I’ll show some code and will describe why decisions were made and to what consequences they led to.
