Publication date: 2017-10-21
Playlist: RustFest Zürich 2017
Description: 
	A real-time stream processing and distributed computation system written completely in Rust designed to out-storm storm and is heavily influenced by the Twitter Heron paper. Antimony addresses all the architectural and efficiency issues of storm just like Heron does however implemented in a much safer language and is not bound to be backward compatible with storm. we will explore the implementation of a cross-platform high performance / lightweight stream processing and distributed computation system in Rust backed by the full power of Tokio.rs
