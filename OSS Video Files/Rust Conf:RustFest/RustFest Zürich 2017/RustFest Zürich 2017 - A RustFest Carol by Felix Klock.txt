Title: RustFest Zürich 2017 - A RustFest Carol by Felix Klock
Publication date: 2017-10-21
Playlist: RustFest Zürich 2017
Description: 
	Is Rust doomed to stagnate under the yoke of stability guarantees? Is change an inevitable force that will invalidate all your existing code? Is there a reasonable medium between these extremes? We explore these questions, under the guise of a modern day fable.

Felix “Scrooge” Klock remembers the early days when Rust development was fast and loose, an untamed beast. As a result, today he fears changes to the language definition.

Gather round as this “Scrooge” is visited by a series of spirits (manifesting themselves as Rust crates), including:

- The Ghost of Rust Epochs Past (code circa the 1.0 release),
- The Ghost of Rust Epochs Present (code today), and
- The Ghost of Rust Epochs Yet To Come (code as envisaged by the host of RFC’s as we head into the 2017 impl Period).
