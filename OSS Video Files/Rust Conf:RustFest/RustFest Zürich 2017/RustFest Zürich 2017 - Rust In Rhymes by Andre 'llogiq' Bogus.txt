Title: RustFest Zürich 2017 - Rust In Rhymes by Andre 'llogiq' Bogus
Publication date: 2017-10-21
Playlist: RustFest Zürich 2017
Description: 
	This talk will take on a rather diverse set of topics, each outlined in limerick form. For each topic, a short explanation, also in rhymes (though not limerick meter), will follow where applicable. Slides will vary between code examples, rustdoc screenshots and memes.

For example:
With unimplemented!() confess;
to your users the method is less
than done–you can now
add a message of how
to deal with the unfinished mess.

To delve a bit more into what’s new
PR 42155 brought to you
the way to get your message through
for things that you still intend to do.
