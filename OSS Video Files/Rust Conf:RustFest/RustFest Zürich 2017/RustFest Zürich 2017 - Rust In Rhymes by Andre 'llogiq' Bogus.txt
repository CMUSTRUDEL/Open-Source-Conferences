Title: RustFest Zürich 2017 - Rust In Rhymes by Andre 'llogiq' Bogus
Publication date: 2017-10-21
Playlist: RustFest Zürich 2017
Description: 
	This talk will take on a rather diverse set of topics, each outlined in limerick form. For each topic, a short explanation, also in rhymes (though not limerick meter), will follow where applicable. Slides will vary between code examples, rustdoc screenshots and memes.

For example:
With unimplemented!() confess;
to your users the method is less
than done–you can now
add a message of how
to deal with the unfinished mess.

To delve a bit more into what’s new
PR 42155 brought to you
the way to get your message through
for things that you still intend to do.

About Andre Bogus:
The quintessential Rust bard Musician by heart, programmer by trade, Rustacean, Lint maven, Rust Tools peer, nags weekly on rust-users and reddit.

some folks call me a rust part but I

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,110
don't think this stuff is too hard so if

00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:22,810
you want to join in

00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:26,410
suit yourself for the win without

00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:29,559
further ado let us start today I'm

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:32,980
discussing in Rhymes a language that

00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:36,370
goes with the times of course I mean

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:46,510
rust and I'll come up with just enough

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:50,530
stuff to talk till the bell chimes I'm

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,489
coding in Java by day sometimes it gets

00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,239
in my way

00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:58,179
we're in rust I abstract I need to

00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:07,150
counteract runaway patterns joining the

00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:11,310
fray rust land is a very strange place

00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:15,250
without now the ref nor they tell race

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,410
it has its own styles but once it

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:22,870
compiles it will never blow up in your

00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:30,610
face now the next one's for Steve rust

00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:36,250
land it's a rust land is a commie utopia

00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:39,310
a zero cost cornucopia for may freely

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:46,510
loan things that others must own as if

00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:50,590
own ships causing myopia rust ations

00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:55,090
will usually track their heap usage

00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:58,630
forwards and back so no allocation lead

00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:01,890
to altercation one could say that we're

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,890
coding full stack

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:11,490
now I see rust-eze implicit drop so your

00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:14,580
data will silently flop out of memory as

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:23,760
one unless you're holding on to it until

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:28,860
your program will stop I was expecting

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:36,630
laughs now with box you put stuff on the

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:40,170
heap it is surprisingly cheap and unlike

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,940
on stack things stay if you go back from

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,940
a function or otherwise sleep

00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:58,970
if in rust coat you need to store one

00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:03,680
item of some type or more you say what

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:11,420
the heck let's simply use vac the name

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:15,910
is emitting at or as many arrests newbie

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,910
feared a while Perot checker appeared

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,650
it's super effective a reference

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:30,250
detective so your code becomes

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,250
well-engineered

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:41,269
when in rust coat you user for it will

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:45,280
loop and each time ask for more if it

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:50,709
does get a none iteration is done

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,709
otherwise there's some value in store

00:03:52,690 --> 00:04:01,160
rust used to just iterate but soon we

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:06,100
too may generate yield a sequence of

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:10,060
stuff then resume that's no bluff

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,060
lookout pipe before it's too late

00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:21,620
don't panic

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,320
in rust code for sport only do it as a

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:28,220
last resort

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:32,919
give resolved back and even arrows on

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:36,650
hand you can handle it without a port

00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:40,310
speaking of which result is a return

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:45,110
type tailored to functions that either

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:48,650
do fail or return on success to the

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,490
calling process so a rust is quite

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,490
candid on failure

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:03,990
can someone guess with that about with

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:07,349
Aaron you can lay back assume that your

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,800
coat is on track to handle our faults

00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:20,490
with nice saying defaults and rap it's a

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:24,060
lazy a sec you want rust to parse

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:27,690
you may choose numb combine Chum

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,539
lollipop peruse pump eel or another

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:39,080
there are many other now you still don't

00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:43,080
know which one it with unimplemented

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:47,550
confess to your users the method is less

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:53,150
than done you can now add a message of

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,150
how to deal with the unfinished Ness to

00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:03,539
develop it more into what is new PR 42

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:06,389
145 brought to you the way to get your

00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:15,449
message through four things that you

00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:18,120
still intend to do more cats rust

00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:23,430
newbies get hang on a thing what is it

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:26,550
with ant STR and string the former is

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:31,370
loaned while the letter is owned and

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,370
thus memory ll kept in

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,550
Nate to safe memory and don't know how

00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,630
you may want to consider a cow so

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,920
instead of a clone

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:13,640
you can borrow or own so use it in all

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:18,710
your coat now let X be a mutable slice

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:22,520
of T where T has a size then we can

00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:31,490
memory place it in various ways I think

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:33,530
that is awesomely nice whenever you

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:41,630
write code like this you may hum

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:43,670
indianajones tune because you do the

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:52,100
same switch or trick he employed in the

00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:55,130
Temple of Doom crates IO has 10 K crates

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,530
in store and everyday is getting more so

00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:03,160
in this secret layer looks relatively

00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:03,160
bare yet no crate to melt Nazis here or

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:18,430
any closure will if it can implement a

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:22,610
trade we call F n also be FN moot and

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:27,700
that stuff looks good and perhaps F and

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:29,830
once once again note that F n once

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,960
consumes the self

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,050
whereas FM mode and if and borrow so

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:40,090
reach not for that effing one's shelf

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:40,090
unless you can consume without sorrow

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:50,220
rust maps to have entries in store don't

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,519
need double takes anymore they are

00:08:50,220 --> 00:09:00,329
awakened or not anyway pretty hot if you

00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:04,139
know what to employ them for if you

00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:08,429
implement from T for fou rust will

00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,850
freely deliver into so use from if it

00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:11,819
fits

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:19,079
and they often rule permits and the rest

00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:21,600
the compiler will do Russ default trade

00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:24,749
gets more hype the more you use it for a

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,049
type for you may want a strive to use

00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:37,980
Auto derive result you have less code to

00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:41,939
type surprise by default rust does read

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:46,170
and write without buffer but speed is

00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:49,189
less than fast so newbies may blast the

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,189
wait for hour to complete

00:09:54,169 --> 00:10:02,879
Austin Hicks did a stellar job reducing

00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:06,059
rust memory slop by teaching rust see to

00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:10,829
reorder feels free unless rep receipt

00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:13,439
tells it to stop and one thing with that

00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:17,519
stuff which is cool with optimization

00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:20,339
fuel we can test where this change leads

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:26,819
to things weird or strange that's a

00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:29,519
really great debugging tool ref young

00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:31,619
and his merrie recitations performed

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,639
some great verifications

00:10:31,619 --> 00:10:40,069
of unsafe things rust so we can all

00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,069
trust it is solid for all applications

00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:54,699
burnt sushi when asked to rewrite rip

00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:58,449
crap in C++ said he might but he'd like

00:10:54,699 --> 00:11:02,970
to refrain from the need to maintain it

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,970
at that would be hell of a fight

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,879
shower is that right a game built in

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,289
rust got greenlit on Steam so we just

00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,479
send congratulations

00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:26,259
amid great celebrations soon will say

00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:30,160
tower rust game dev lost I have to bring

00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:34,589
this one obviously our Clippy will warn

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,269
us on code that may add Sunday corrode

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:40,179
through our source and about it will

00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:50,949
gladly look out for patterns that do not

00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:53,319
well boat he used rusts type system to

00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:56,949
restrict how your API is used and be

00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:58,720
strict here will of compiled tests to

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:01,649
put your fears to rest if the wrong

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,649
restrictions you picked

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:15,790
rust coding is one of the best if you

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:20,740
want to easily test your code when given

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:24,029
stuff performs correct enough cargo fuss

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,029
will take care of the rest

00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:37,810
our rust will help you conserve the

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:42,150
battery charge you reserve for the code

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:46,350
that you run for your work of a fun

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,350
oh.what from your service you serve

00:12:51,800 --> 00:13:01,399
hands up who knows that one quite a few

00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:05,690
rust coat with a value and break may

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:09,200
lead to a certain mistake if you try to

00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:12,850
break rust try it out if you must in the

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,850
rust Easter egg hunt partake

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:24,920
who knows what rust in six weeks give us

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:27,649
new features and tweaks will it blend

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:38,630
will it slice and be awesome and nice oh

00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:41,870
now I sound like a total geek in me rust

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:44,810
will be three years old you know we all

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:49,399
call me from one zero the changes have

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:54,170
been pretty bold every six weeks it grew

00:13:49,399 --> 00:14:02,690
out the old and in you yet the stability

00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:07,459
promise will hold looking into my

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:11,540
crystal ball I see much awesome progress

00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:16,570
this fall with implementations by many

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,570
recitations it's the period after all

00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:27,890
with rust more folks get access to

00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:32,540
systems programming's with less fearful

00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:36,040
foot guns and stuff C++ has enough so

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,040
here's to its enduring success

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:45,160
[Applause]

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:52,509
if into you rust you want to enter there

00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,389
may be a few who haven't yet join a

00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:57,600
project and find you a mentor who will

00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:02,220
help you for free so you can easily

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,220
become a great rust implementer

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:13,959
recitations don't need to code rust we

00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:16,660
document T block and dust of some or

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:20,129
other tests they are very stressed that

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,129
our code may not do what it must

00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:32,970
I had to bring this one really let's

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:37,029
bring some elucidation rust owes its

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:40,029
denomination to a fungus that has three

00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:47,740
life stages alas many mistake it for

00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:51,130
oxidation let some be arcs into it or

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,839
fold zero old PP pars unread plus old

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:57,579
print alone times

00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:07,269
vada bun 0u 64 plus sons left left

00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:10,089
this one's Limerick old thanks for

00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:13,390
listening while I wax poetically on

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:16,360
multiple stacks and I hope that you walk

00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,850
happy out of this talk otherwise

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:36,809
there'll be no moneybags

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:36,809
