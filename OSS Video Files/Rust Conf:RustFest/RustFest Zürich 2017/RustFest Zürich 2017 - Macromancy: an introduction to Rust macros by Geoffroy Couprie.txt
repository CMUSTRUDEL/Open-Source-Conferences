Title: RustFest Zürich 2017 - Macromancy: an introduction to Rust macros by Geoffroy Couprie
Publication date: 2017-10-21
Playlist: RustFest Zürich 2017
Description: 
	Many times you must reuse code
And your generics aren’t commode
Can you deal in the macro dark arts
Recompose code of similar parts
Or would the compiler explode?

Rejoice! Follow now our ways
Unlock the compiler’s high praise
Listen here to this initiation
Each eldritch arcane incantation
Summons help ‘gainst the terrors we face.
