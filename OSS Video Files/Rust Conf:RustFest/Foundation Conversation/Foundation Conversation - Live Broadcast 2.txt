 behind a lot of the things that we                                that we were doing with this foundation                                um i wanted to be                                on this the last event but my internet                                disagreed and failed the moment we went                                live                                so i'm happy to be here for the second                                try and hopefully                                it all holds                                nico yeah so i'm niko                                uh i introduced

time mark kind of prompted me                                about to make sure i pointed that out                                but i'm also a member of the core team

you know really                                involved in this                                foundation planning and everything else                                and super excited to see that work                                coming to fruition                                there you have it ashley                                hi i'm ashley i'm really excited to have                                a really in-depth conversation about                                editor preferences                                um it's going to be great i use vim                                highlighting have you                                yeah no um uh it's really early and this                                coffee is not complete                                uh but i'm ashley i'm on the core team                                i've been doing a lot of work on this                                foundation                                situation which i guess is another name                                for it uh yeah                                and i'm very sleep dependent i'll leave                                it at that                                all right see florian you said it's not                                that early but                                given when you respond to my pings like                                on a regular basis                                i kind of suspect that this is actually                                quite early for you personally                                if not europe in general am i wrong                                currently yes for the reason that um                                due to us having to sink a lot of uh                                having to spend a lot of swing time                                and the evenings being better my current                                work life is a little shifted towards                                more the afternoon towards the evening                                um                                to uh to spend the                                high intense time on the foundation on                                the foundation in the evenings but in                                in general um i've got a normal                                rather normal sleep schedule so coming                                back in january                                but i'm glad to hear that because i                                often send messages and i'm like                                i'm sure flynn will get to this when he                                wakes up and then you answer right away                                and i'm like what have i done                                [Laughter]                                so yeah let's get started um                                so before we head into live questions                                which i i'm not seeing any yet so you                                know                                keep asking keep tweeting um but let's                                start with this                                uh sort of question for each of you um                                 so what excites you in particular                                 about the foundation and sort of if                                 there's some problems you're interested                                 in solving or                                 um you know thing you want to tackle                                 first thing or have the foundation                                 tackle as the case may be                                 and let's start with florian                                 so what excites me the most about the                                 foundation um                                 a certain kind of independence in that                                 the foundation is                                 a part and the tool of the project to uh                                 to grow                                 and work on its own                                 and set its own workflows                                 around all the things that were                                 previously handled                                 by externally particularly                                 by mozilla very greatly and                                 the other thing i'm                                 enjoying a ton is the ability to                                 collaborate with                                 organizations that's a my my huge                                 thing that excites me                                 or you kind of stole my answer                                 i was just gonna riff on on                                 organizations because we were                                 we ended up using the word corporate                                 persons yesterday and we're having quite                                 fun with it                                 um sorry sorry                                 yeah um all right nico has already                                 cursed on the broadcast so                                 it's been a success um amazing did you                                 call on me mark for what excites me most                                 about the foundation                                 sure oh i wasn't trying to like jump in                                 live                                 nico said that foreign to think                                 um i think the thing that excites me the                                 most about the foundation                                 is that i don't know i've been doing                                 open source                                 for a long time at this point which is                                 weird because i                                 used to say it was a short time and time                                 passed                                 uh and sometimes it's been my job and                                 sometimes it's been as a volunteer but                                 i don't know it it's been i've been                                 really frustrated with the                                 general like economic and organizational                                 model of it                                 and to continue to try to do the same                                 thing                                 and expect different results is uh kind                                 of a                                 very silly thing to do and to a certain                                 extent when                                 i was participating in open source i                                 feel like that's what i was doing                                 in my attempt to avoid burnout and so it                                 feels really                                 exciting and powerful and energizing                                 to feel like we might be trying to move                                 that needle                                 and come up with structures that                                 that that can help change that that                                 situation where like maybe you know                                 burning out isn't isn't just the natural                                 like                                 path um and that that we can really come                                 up with                                 with ways to like establish                                 sustainability for both individuals and                                 projects                                 so i feel like that's maybe a little a                                 little heady for me                                 at                                                                     excites me because                                 i don't know i've many times over the                                 last couple years i've been like                                 should i keep doing this stuff like is                                 this a good idea                                 um and sometimes it feels like the                                 answer is                                 like no and also don't recommend other                                 people do this either                                 so uh i don't know i'm excited to                                 to try and try and turn turn that page                                 nico do you have an answer now                                 well so for i won't deny having asked                                 myself that question                                 but i'm happy to say the answer is yes                                 still but uh                                 it is it is tricky but uh the thing i                                 i wanted to say the thing i was going                                 the answer i was going to give which i                                 think is similar to what                                 florian said but different maybe is that                                 what excites me the most about                                 rust is collaboration i guess about rust                                 and                                 open source and i feel like rust has                                 done a really                                 good job uh i mean we have our problems                                 but we've done a really good job at                                 enabling                                 collaboration but mostly at an                                 individual level and                                 um i feel like the foundation gives us a                                 chance to take that up to an                                 organizational level and i'm pretty                                 excited                                 to see what comes out of that and i                                 think there's going to be like a                                 feedback loop like i think if you've                                 been listening to what we've been saying                                 about supporting the maintainers and                                 and the mission of the foundation the                                 whole the sort of goal                                 of this organizational collaboration is                                 to come back and support                                 the individuals and the individual                                 collaboration that has worked so well                                 that it's begun to                                 suffer problems of scale um and                                 i think that's a really exciting                                 feedback loop and i like                                 one of the challenges that i think comes                                 out of open source is that                                 there's a kind of tragedy of the commons                                 where it                                 the great part about it is it belongs to                                 no organization no single organization                                 the bad part is that means no single                                 organization is tending                                 to it and tending to like all of the                                 managerial and organizational needs that                                 come up in it                                 uh i think i think actually it was                                 ashley and florian who first pointed out                                 to me that like we have                                     individual contributors and zero                                 managers in the rest project                                 uh and i was like oh that is not a                                 direct quote                                 some of you are managers                                 yeah yeah it's true and and i mean i see                                 myself as playing a managerial role in                                 other things at least at times but like                                 it's true that we have a lot of people                                 working and that's really awesome but it                                 is true that like                                 there's a need to to strengthen the                                 structure that they're working in                                 and i think it's really cool and i'm                                 excited to see if we can do that                                 um i have a                                 i have a question there for you niko um                                 the words that formed in my head in in                                 what you were talking is um do you think                                 the foundation will bring bring a                                 certain simplicity                                 to two things that were more complex                                 before                                 i hope so speaking of hidden complexity                                 in that questions                                 i do think so yeah i think by making                                 some things first class that we're                                 like not first class like i mean if                                 nothing else having                                 like it's definitely true that having a                                 legal entity that can                                 sign contracts and take actions uh on                                 behalf of the project will                                 simplify a lot of things                                 operationally i don't think that's not                                 sure if that's what you were going for                                 but i think that's obviously true                                 yeah those were the things i was was                                 kind of getting at because that's                                 what i try to um to express like this                                 this is what it means to be in the                                 the the value of independence for me                                 like making it easier                                 um to actually have all on the                                 roof um and these concerns under under                                 one roof                                 um together with the project and making                                 sure that there's a                                 constant it's easier to have constant                                 conversations                                 um under with the same mission and under                                 the same                                 same roof so um for me the                                 i was just gonna say with that ease                                 though like we're saying that that adds                                 simplicity                                 but like i'd potentially argue that us                                 being independent also adds like                                 a significant amount of complexity                                 because things that were like                                 just kind of given to us before that                                 we didn't have control to change now is                                 potentially                                 like under our purview which means like                                 the space of things to design                                 has grown dramatically which is exciting                                 but certainly is a type of complexity                                 there will probably be questions we                                 cannot sidestep as easily anymore that's                                 for sure i think right but                                 uh that's what this whole process is                                 about                                 conversation                                 i had a thought about this something                                 that you were saying oh well                                 what you're just saying both of you just                                 kind of sparked another                                 another thing that i'm excited about in                                 the foundation actually                                 which is that i think it's it's opening                                 up                                 uh kind of another avenue for us to                                 bring                                 and promote like more leadership from                                 within the rest organization                                 different kinds of leadership uh and                                 maybe that's just on my mind after like                                 the blog post i was just working on and                                 so on but i                                 but i think i think that's going to be                                 a really cool theme and i think that's                                 going to help with this problem that                                 actually was raising like yeah we have                                 new questions but we're going to have                                 like new venues and more leaders and                                 more ways for people to tackle those                                 questions                                 that's going to be great                                 yeah i think that's particularly                                 exciting like                                 i don't know i've always been against                                 designing things from first principles                                 and one of the best ways to avoid                                 that situation is to make sure that                                 people who have experience doing these                                 types of things and like                                 have done them before are like in the                                 room uh                                 and it's just been hard to i think it's                                 always been in the spirit of russ to                                 invite folks                                 to that room but we've just kind of                                 lacked the                                 the overhead and the scaffolding to like                                 make being in that room with that set of                                 skills like                                 pleasant and so i'm i i think that                                 that the opportunity there is is going                                 to be really great                                 i i definitely agree on the not                                 inventing some first principles                                 uh design um i definitely                                 enjoyed a lot of the things that around                                 looking at what                                 other foundations do and see like where                                 does our plan                                 uh like fit what others do or                                 con consciously choosing uh between                                 their standard solutions for this let's                                 pick a standard solution and                                 um spend time on things where                                 what we feel we can                                 [Music]                                 find improvements like                                 i guess one question sort of that has                                 sparked in my mind                                 um from sort of what you've talked about                                 is sort of we've talked about how                                 you know there's new problems to tackle                                 maybe new venues to tackle them in                                 but to some extent i think one of the                                 things we've been sort of aiming for                                 with the foundation                                 is that while we sort of create these                                 new venues the                                 sort of inflow of information and and                                 people into the project uh is still                                 going to be                                 fairly unified uh we're not going to be                                 trying to split things apart and i'm                                 wondering if any of you want to talk                                 about that a little bit                                 yeah yes i                                 i was trying to bail you out because i                                 knew you were have still working on your                                 coffee                                 but uh if you if you were just like that                                 now i i mean i drank                                 all the coffee in this cup and the other                                 coffee is like over there                                 and i'm just i know it's a huge mess                                 but no i mean i i think that that the                                 point mark is bringing up is really                                 important                                 so i think there's like an interesting                                 balance here to strike about                                 how the foundation and the project                                 potentially relate                                 but as it as it comes to like folks                                 participating                                 like i don't think we want to have a                                 sense of project volunteers                                 and foundation volunteers i mean i would                                 even                                 go so far as to say like i don't know                                 project staff versus volunteer                                 this is like they're they're it's rust                                 people                                 like rust volunteers um and i think it's                                 really critical to keep that unified                                 um yeah                                 the foundation is                                 the project is the foundation uh or                                 we're together                                 no i think that was not supposed to say                                 those words because they can sound a                                 little frightening                                 but yeah that's what                                 that's precisely where i have this model                                 in my head of under one roof                                 um i think it's a it's a huge problem if                                 those things are                                 seen as as um is different and there's                                 an                                 artificial barrier a barrier between it                                 between the foundation people and the                                 um and the the project people                                 and the the thing that i um                                 enjoyed most is working in organizations                                 um                                 where the plane doesn't matter because                                 we're we're working towards the same                                 goal making rust better                                 in many different ways and with um                                 slightly different focus and that's like                                 just like because of the work you can do                                 um in certain spaces and we                                 agreeing with what actually was                                 mentioning that                                 this gives us the ability to do                                 more kinds of work which also makes                                 things more complex but i'm                                 very much looking forward to that                                 because it's enabling                                 to even be able to do that kind of work                                 i mean                                 i think when so when i said the                                 foundation is the project and the                                 project is the foundation i think the                                 really interesting question is what is                                 what does the word project even actually                                 mean right i think                                 what a lot of us have in our heads or at                                 least what i                                 i think when we use that word we are                                 often meaning the rust teams                                 existing west teams and those are not                                 equal to the foundation any sense                                 those teams are they exist and the                                 foundation is like                                 there to enable them and help them work                                 uh that is its mission                                 and or enable the people on them i think                                 and support those maintainers who are                                 members of them                                 uh but but at the same time                                 like you know we've talked on the in the                                 frequently asked questions about some of                                 the structure and we'll we'll be going                                 more into that in                                 the coming weeks and so on but like they                                 have                                 we're you know the foundation board will                                 include a number of members from the                                 teams and there's representation going                                 there and there we are kind of working                                 all together                                 towards the same goal right and i think                                 that's pretty cool                                 right yeah i think i i kind of want to                                 riff on this idea that you said like the                                 foundation is the project the project is                                 a foundation and like that's scary                                 and i think one of the reasons that can                                 be scary is just                                 the foundation is a new entity                                 and it can be really weird to feel like                                 there's a new entity that's like                                 put into potentially a position of like                                 power                                 and control and one of the things that                                 we talked about a lot with the                                 the project group as we're thinking                                 about the foundation and kind of how it                                 plays into like                                 just the whole kind of like ecosystem of                                 rust and i do think ecosystem almost                                 makes more sense than project                                 since there's a lot of little projects                                 inside of rust                                 is that like the the foundation is is a                                 player within that ecosystem                                 and and while it's it's going to be                                 like a governance body because that's                                 what a foundation is                                 i i think it's it's also really                                 important to just like say out loud that                                 we know that                                 there's going to be a period of trust                                 earning uh                                 that has to happen and like the the no                                 matter what we say                                 today or you know in the faq like                                 the foundation is going to need to be                                 like a                                 a part of the community and we're going                                 to have to see how those types of things                                 play out um and i i think that's really                                 important but i                                 i do think it's it's it's critical to                                 call out that like                                 it's not the goal of the foundation to                                 to like consume and subsume the entirety                                 of the project so much as like be a                                 player within that ecosystem                                 but i i also think there's a chance in                                 this so                                 the foundation is a little bit of a                                 blank sheet of paper currently                                 and um i think this is what some some of                                 the unease may come                                 just from that because um and this is                                 why we're having this conversation and                                 talking about our plans for what's right                                 on that piece of paper                                 but there's also a lot of chances in                                 this because we can open up new                                 conversations we can open up new                                 new ways of conversations new ways of                                 engagement new ways of working                                 in our project new ways off transforming                                 the project um growing growing over the                                 next years ensuring that growth                                 so um i                                 like i'm super happy about starting to                                 write on that piece of paper                                 so uh and let's hope it ends up being                                 not i'm sure that it's going to be a                                 good story um                                 and i'm very much looking forward to                                 that                                 yeah so along these sort of                                 lines of writing on the piece of paper i                                 think lauren you're not quite right                                 about the blank piece of paper it's like                                 graph paper or something we have sort of                                 structure there                                 that was good mark that was good i also                                 love graph paper                                 can i steal that can can can i steal the                                 mc role and pivot to a                                 to a question uh there was this question                                 that was raised in the fact                                 of like what was one of the hardest                                 parts of designing the foundation and                                 what i was going to say was                                 i think the question of what to define                                 and what to leave for the future                                 actually is one of the more subtle and                                 hard questions uh                                 that's what i thought about when i heard                                 the blank paper reference because                                 you know i think we've tried to be we                                 first of all we were operating we were                                 trying to move quickly and                                 and that poses some like constraints but                                 i think also just                                 it was really important to us to leave                                 space for the foundation to                                 like for us to explore and iterate and                                 learn from what's working and what's not                                 and we don't want to try to do                                 everything upfront that doesn't make                                 sense                                 but at the same time to set up a                                 structure that will                                 like guide that iteration down the path                                 we think is going to be most successful                                 um and i think that was a fun balancing                                 act to try to strike                                 yeah and i think one one thing i'll note                                 uh nico's                                 sort of i'm not part of the like                                 foundation group though lately i've been                                 doing a lot more there                                 you basically are mark i don't think you                                 should say that you're i mean                                 what even is it                                 the question                                 mark is like stop talking                                 the thing i was going to bring up is                                 that uh sort of as we sort of one of the                                 reasons we want to provide this                                 initial like structure and framework for                                 like the foundation and to some extent                                 uh sort of more broadly um sort of these                                 interactions with the teams and so forth                                 is to sort of design intentionally not                                 just for like the next year of the                                 foundation                                 but also for like the next                                                                                                            can grow into you know that shape and                                 fill that structure without having to                                 like                                 you know break new ground or whatever                                 every year as we um grow as a project                                 and community                                 yes yes what i found                                 really the hardest the hardest part in                                 this process was also staying focused on                                 having all the important conversations                                 on                                 what is what is the goal of this instead                                 of we're just setting up a legal                                 structure thinking like                                 we had a lot of conversations around                                 what are the goals what are                                 um things we probably better not do                                 what have we seen fail especially in our                                 own experiences                                 a lot of the people in the foundation                                 working group have done this                                 before in other communities um i've been                                 part of                                 a a ruby non-profit over here in berlin                                 or                                 actually you still am so um taking all                                 those experiences                                 and um                                 and critically investigate on                                 what can we do to make this like                                 something for                                      and not for                                                            that                                 um was was an enjoyable path                                 it was hard you were thinking on a                                 really big time scale                                 uh the language for the next                                             it                                 trust i heard                                                           really long time                                 uh but i hope russ is still in use                                 you're like                                                       um empowering people to write stable and                                 future-proof software                                 i think that's a really good point                                 though actually yeah                                 i mean i don't know i'm gonna dodge the                                 question for a second and talk about                                 like future proofing because as a group                                 of engineers here we all want to write                                 code that will be                                 like maintainable and changeable                                 and like but we also all know that                                 that's like kind of a lie                                 like you can't really like when you                                 write software you're like oh this is                                 going to be like a really good                                 abstraction for like the next                                 like year and like you are cursing                                 yourself like within two days                                 about like the decisions that you've                                 made so like                                 the the words that i've been saying a                                 lot this process which i'm sure these                                 other three are like so                                 sick of hearing me say is like systems                                 of affordances                                 so like one oh yeah there we go nico's                                 laughing at me perfect                                 um one of the things i think that we                                 like don't                                 pay as much attention to that i wish we                                 did is like                                 kind of like the this the way we set up                                 incentives that have like these like                                 chronic effects over long periods of                                 time                                 and they are like by far the hardest                                 things to see                                 but they are the things that over long                                 periods of time really shape                                 like what your organization and group                                 can do and                                 i think as an open source project rust                                 actually got a lot                                 of these incentives right                                 and so when i think about like designing                                 the foundation like there's bylaws                                 i expect the bylaws to change even                                 though like                                 every foundation is like afraid of                                 having to change their bylaws like so                                 much                                 um they're gonna change i actually think                                 the more agile we can be about changing                                 those the better                                 not to use like people are grumpy about                                 agile right i don't know i shouldn't                                 have said that                                 anyways i just meant flexible um                                 but uh but but coming up with like like                                 really understanding what the like                                 key vision and values are like is kind                                 of what sets up those like                                 affordances and incentives that like                                 drives things forward                                 so that's that's been something i've                                 been like really                                 excited about um i'm not going to answer                                 what the hardest part is until                                 mark really forces me to which is fine                                 i think i'll note that it was me who                                 injected that whole thing and not                                 poor mark was like don't don't but i                                 think uh florian's uh                                 i think florian's answer gets at that                                 right like there was definitely i will                                 confess                                 on my part a desire to like or at least                                 a                                 tendency let's say sometimes to just                                 drop in at the lowest level and we've                                 all seen that                                 whenever you're doing design that can                                 happen right you're just like here's how                                 the code should look                                 instead of dialing back or whatever it                                 is here's how the by-laws should                                 instead of dialing back to be sort of                                 what are the big picture                                 what is the goal not just how kind of                                 majority do you need to make a decision                                 but like                                 uh you know what are they trying to                                 decide and why                                 um and that                                 that is really useful to have someone                                 remind you to pull back and look at that                                 it's i mean it's a it's a process of                                 actually like what do we push off                                 because we've already also had the                                 conversation of                                 uh can we as this small group decide                                 certain things that should                                 should be decided later so the                                 conversation of                                 we actually think that should be decided                                 for the uh that should be a decision for                                 the people doing the work later and                                 implementing that has been                                 a constant thing and like separating                                 things into                                 into goal setting and also oh no this is                                 this would be a detailed decision where                                 we would actually take away                                 um take that away from from the person                                 that would actually do                                 do that later and what we don't think um                                 it's                                 it's it's good to make this decision                                 now so and that is a that has been an                                 effort to                                 separate these these things strongly                                 um i enjoyed that for effort a lot                                 because it also means                                 um thinking about how the organization                                 may work later                                 yeah it i don't know i've been sort of                                 increasingly involved as ashley will                                 tell me i've always been involved but                                 you know                                 it's been in the last like three weeks                                 or so but                                 uh as sort of we've been getting that                                 involvement ramping up                                 sort of from just a project group to a                                 wider set of folks on the core team                                 it's been really interesting to see sort                                 of this transition i think from                                 um sort of diving into ideas and sort of                                 working out all these sort of details                                 that we need for                                 the um foundation to even like exist                                 to sort of shifting a little bit to                                 these sort of                                 broader ideas of like why do we exist or                                 sort of why                                 you know do we what goals are we trying                                 to solve or what problems can we tackle                                 and                                 to some extent like how we can tackle                                 those problems to design in                                 the sort of like as ashley always says                                 systems of affordances                                 to be able to tackle those problems                                 right from the sort of                                 foundation nico what was that                                 it                                 i have heard the words a lot lately but                                 i they're important                                 yeah anyways okay before we move on to                                 other questions because we actually have                                 some questions                                 in the comments which is awesome uh                                 the the thing that i want to say about                                 the hardest part of this is is to kind                                 of like pull out of                                 the heady answers and just go                                 to a certain extent when we announced                                 that we were going to do this in                                 august right like basically what we were                                 proposing                                 is that as a hobby we were going to                                 speed run                                 starting a new company um that's that's                                 what we said that we were gonna do and                                 if i think about what's the hardest part                                 of it                                 um it's just the thing that we did was                                 the hardest part                                 like the idea that we thought that we                                 could pull that off at all                                 um i have been i'll say like                                 every morning i wake up and kind of go                                 like oh what if we like                                 don't do this like what if this like                                 doesn't happen and like the                                 the difference between this happening                                 and it not happening is like                                 me doing stuff today and like every day                                 there is stuff that if i don't do it                                 like this doesn't happen                                 um that that was the hardest part                                 and it's not over yet um we're still                                 going                                 so yeah uh i think                                 my friend luis via when he was when we                                 announced the uh                                 the faq on twitter he was like we're                                 watching like a                                                                                                         yeah like most people don't like                                 endeavor to try and do this in like                                 a couple months um very very bold choice                                 this one first of all i want to                                 apologize i decided i was going way too                                 far with my systems of affordances jokes                                 but                                 uh i'm all into it but uh secondly i                                 think you nailed it with that                                 by the way that is totally true and on                                 on the speed run figure it's also not an                                 any percent speed run                                 i want to share one thing uh talking                                 about                                 about that um i i got a couple of um                                 feedback sessions with                                 with some people actually outside of the                                 russ community before we started this                                 endeavor or at the beginning                                 and one quote that stuck out to me from                                 someone was                                 the thing i always find interesting when                                 seeing the rust project from the outside                                 is that you take theory like as you say                                 the heady stuff and you put it into                                 action like you you pick what you want                                 and then you put it into                                 um then you actually actually build it                                 and that was i think that that that's                                 the thing that has connected me to this                                 process a lot of                                 this is actually an idea i had my head                                 with all of my experience and whatever                                 but what can we do                                 out of it like how can we actually make                                 that uh make that thing happening                                 um and yeah so                                 yeah yeah and it i mean it's                                 exhilarating to make it happen                                 but it's also like terrifying                                 i've definitely just been very nervous                                 but i am excited it feels like it feels                                 like it's actually happening                                 [Laughter]                                 okay should we address the question yeah                                 that's the question                                 um what was the question                                 uh will there be changes in teams and                                 community projects structurally                                 i just totally took your job mark i'm                                 the worst                                 oh you can read it again if you want                                 no no it's it's good uh so i guess i                                 don't know are we splitting the question                                 apart                                 are we i guess we can just answer it as                                 a whole i don't know let's go with                                 uh florian since you're most awake of                                 any of us                                 you can uh take a stab at the question                                 i'll i'll not split                                 the the question uh no um                                 i think one one thing that sets the                                 worst project apart and that's also                                 feedback i got                                 a lot is that the rest project has                                 always and that's                                 particularly the reason why i am in the                                 ros project always seen things like                                 community interaction                                 and all the things you need to do around                                 the code                                 as a core function of this project you                                 can see that in                                 our yearly surveying in that we have a                                 community team from the beginning                                 and and um that a lot of the teams also                                 it's not just the community team that a                                 lot of the teams are very community                                 minded and are taking community feedback                                 um i said a lot um all of them                                 sorry all of them and um                                 then and we have substantial projects                                 outside                                 uh outside of the project and outside                                 like the boundary is floating there                                 um some people for example are                                 individually part of the rust project                                 but they do also have something                                 on the side and that where they're                                 running a meet up or something like that                                 and i think that system works well and                                 it i it would be oh                                 um we will make that better                                 i'm sure and um we will find ways to                                 make that better in the next years but i                                 i think it's a strong point so                                 i'd be um very cautious with                                 choices that don't come out of                                 this system already so                                 long story short changes always happen                                 but not out of                                 this conversation i have the feeling                                 nico you just stole my answer                                 the thing i was going to say is yes                                 there will be changes in teams and                                 community projects but not directly as a                                 result of creating the foundation                                 like because the project is always                                 evolving and we                                 like are going to make changes because                                 we're going to do things better                                 but creating the foundation itself is                                 not                                 um it's not res it's not like we're also                                 adjusting a bunch of team changes at the                                 same time                                 i i said directly because i think that                                 the foundation is going to have                                 unforeseen and wonderful                                 impacts over time i was about to jump in                                 and say that                                 which is like i i do think that this                                 foundation                                 conversation and like the conversation                                 doesn't stop once the foundation gets                                 kicked off right it will continue to be                                 a dialogue                                 um but uh like the i                                 what i am excited about is i think i                                 don't know nico also is probably                                 irritated with me saying like i'm so                                 excited about the opportunity to look at                                  like                                  data and stuff um because i am                                  but i i okay                                  i'll have to like keep a list of which                                  ones nico likes um                                  but uh like our series of of of teams                                  and projects is just huge and i don't                                  think we have great                                  visibility into it and so the project                                  is always growing and changing but                                  i mean i think i think we might agree                                  that like it doesn't                                  grow and change like quickly maybe is                                  not the right word but like                                  it we're not as efficient about growing                                  and changing based on                                  our like changing needs as as we might                                  want to be and i i see the foundation as                                  an opportunity                                  to like get better at that                                  and like to be able to again like bring                                  support and resources into thinking                                  about                                  how we do those types of things um so                                  yeah no the foundation isn't going to be                                  like                                  we declare that there is a space                                  communism team now just a suggestion                                  just throwing that one out there                                  um but like if the foundation said that                                  like                                  everyone would be like no foundation                                  that's like not your job                                  um but uh i think there's an opportunity                                  to go like man                                  like we have so many space communism                                  initiatives it would be really great if                                  we could create some scaffolding                                  around that portion of the project and                                  be able to support it                                  that might be more of the shape that we                                  would see that happen in                                  anyways i i feel like folks are now                                  maybe excited about this in the chat                                  that's cool                                  completely random idea has nothing to do                                  with anything i promise                                  there's also an an effect to be aware of                                  um                                  well that was particularly the reason                                  why i've                                  actively searched for people from pretty                                  much outside even outside of the                                  community or who are a little bit more                                  more distant from um for                                  for getting feedback that um                                  being in the thick of it for now                                  roughly five years um means that you see                                  a lot of the problems                                  very dominantly and people from the                                  outside can give you feedback on the                                  things that                                  work and seeing that particularly                                  that people highlight oh the interaction                                  between the project                                  and the community like that has a wide                                  to it like particularly that that that                                  has a wife that radiates                                  also points to well this white must                                  continue to exist                                  and um because it's a good thing it's                                  it's a strong point um so                                  thinking so my thinking has turned a lot                                  towards                                  how can we make this in                                  increase and um and ride that wave                                  essentially                                  yeah so i think we've talked sort of a                                  little bit about how the foundation is                                  going to interact with the community but                                  sort of this question i think brings us                                  sort of closer to that and i'm wondering                                  florian if you want to talk a little bit                                  about                                  sort of if there's you know we said that                                  there's probably structural changes that                                  are going to happen just as a result of                                  rust growth not really                                  foundation directly um but i think                                  people are probably also interested in                                  this question of like well what is the                                  foundation                                  you know going to change in the                                  community or maybe you know it's nothing                                  or                                  sort of that general area                                  so what it's going to change is a good                                  question for for something that doesn't                                  exist yet                                  like it's going to exist um                                  it will be um like i still see it as it                                  will be a                                  an additional component to the project                                  to make uh                                  to enable um                                  new kinds of interactions and for                                  example work together with teams like                                  the community team to come up                                  with um with actions and programs and                                  and and support them so this will uh                                  this will always be                                  i don't even want to say joint effort                                  this will be an effort under the same                                  same roof um with um                                  with new approaches that we that we can                                  take um                                  that weren't i don't want to say                                  possibly before                                  that weren't as easy before and we have                                  had a                                  community interaction we had a community                                  ground programs and all of these um                                  as the project all the time and the                                  foundation                                  will be and we have this with together                                  with partners always and the foundation                                  will be um will help us                                  um that will help us making                                  um programs happen                                  what just happened there some stuff i                                  know i'm sorry                                  i learned a new thing about stream yard                                  by accident                                  in the middle of florian's answer which                                  is i can take questions from the                                  comments and                                  if i accidentally click them they will                                  just show up on the screen which is like                                  really useful um this is a very                                  complicated way of just saying                                  there's a new question                                  i'm sorry florian you're answering no                                  problem                                  ashley do you want to like do that again                                  or something because i actually did not                                  okay ooh it's a it's kind of a big one                                  but it's                                  i i think it's a great question uh we                                  have like                                                                                                            we answer a question like this in                                     minutes will be hard but                                  i'm excited to address it                                  yeah i guess let's let's start with this                                  sort of how teams and foundation                                  will be in sync um i think so i guess                                  one of the things we can talk about                                  there                                  is this idea of sort of                                  relationships and and sort of how the                                  you know teams will                                  be able to or you know uh willing to                                  talk to                                  people on the foundation and vice versa                                  um                                  nico do you want to take us off there                                  yeah um i mean i think so                                  i mentioned already that the project has                                  some representatives and things that                                  will be part of the foundation but i                                  think the question of how teams will                                  will talk to the foundation i mean the                                  way we've been thinking of it is mostly                                  that                                  to start the simplest answer is if teams                                  have ideas you know                                  for what they would like to see done                                  they should take them to the core team                                  uh and the core team has representatives                                  on the foundation board that can kind of                                  think about those ideas and bring them                                  up uh                                  and that's kind of a natural flow and                                  the nice thing about that information is                                  that                                  it may be that the team has an idea of                                  something they want to do                                  you may not actually need to like it may                                  not actually require the foundation                                  right or maybe there's another way to go                                  about it that                                  that that someone uh and the core team                                  has an idea and so                                  we kind of wanted to keep that flow                                  going up through the                                  uh through the existing teams and then                                  to the foundation and not so much like                                  everybody's talking to everybody and it                                  gets a little overwhelming uh but                                  you know i think that's the primary flow                                  we have in mind                                  um for that although i imagine people                                  will                                  there will be other channels that arise                                  over time                                  well i was gonna say i i don't disagree                                  with you nico but i might                                  i might give like a different priority                                  to how i answer                                  okay yeah so i i do think                                  one of the ways that the project uh and                                  like the teams will interact with the                                  foundation is proposing                                  initiatives um but i i think one of the                                  critical first things to say                                  is that the teams and the foundation are                                  not                                  entirely separate at all um like the                                  the foundation board is it has is                                  is going to have oh my gosh sorry my dog                                  just woke up                                  there he goes he feels strongly about                                  this the foundation and the project are                                  gone                                  um                                  um the foundation board has                                  representatives from the project                                  on it and so the way that they will stay                                  in sync                                  and communicate is that there are people                                  there                                  to make sure like people who will be in                                  both rooms                                  who will be able to have shared context                                  across                                  those different organizational bodies                                  so it's it's not like there's two black                                  boxes                                  and we need to like create some sort of                                  channel                                  um yes uh one of the key uh directors                                  for the project on the board will be my                                  dog                                  um he has some serious collaboration                                  issues though                                  that are concerning uh but                                  uh as we talk about like an overseeing                                  structure                                  like i definitely like this second word                                  you use which is                                  meld i definitely think that it's it's                                  more that the foundation                                  extension is the wrong word but it's                                  part of one                                  large organization not two separate ones                                  that are kind of chatting                                  um and so of course with my dog stopping                                  barking i will uh                                  let other folks talk down gosh                                  yeah that's uh there's this one part of                                  that i want to address is like                                  the the part overseeing the foundation                                  will not i don't see them as like                                  overseeing the project but again this                                  thinking of                                  will be a resource to the project an                                  additional thing that we                                  plug on and um participate in                                  the collaborative structure that the the                                  rust project has                                  but be responsible for for tasks that we                                  didn't have before and the rust project                                  already has a                                  strong tasking of teams                                  so for example things that the release                                  team doesn't sign off on                                  all of the other teams can complain as                                  much as they want to if the release team                                  says this is not a sufficient high                                  quality it doesn't get too stable                                  and in that level the foundation will                                  also play some                                  of these critical roles where it has to                                  oversee for example                                  it will definitely oversee a budget                                  because that's what uh                                  what part of that structure is there for                                  um                                  so that will be the thing that it brings                                  but also and this is one thing that i'm                                  very happy about in the rust project is                                  that we have a lot of                                  upstanding self-confident teams and                                  that is a good way on how these teams                                  can because they're already                                  self-confident can                                  interact with the new part that we plug                                  on                                  and the foundation in that case will be                                  part of this yeah system of performances                                  groups of self-confident teams whatever                                  um you you may want to have and i think                                  this is like how we should                                  um how we need to to approach this as                                  like this is a this is a chance this is                                  these are people that want to do that                                  particular piece of work                                  um and um they                                  have their needs the things they can                                  bring                                  and um and the resources they can they                                  can add to the project so                                  the melding is i think that's the                                  um that's i i'll pick the melt from that                                  question yeah                                  i i do think so maybe one thing that i                                  might touch on is that sort of we've                                  talked about this melding but i think                                  a critical element here is that the                                  foundation                                  i don't know sort of how you see melding                                  exactly but there's not going to be like                                  a                                  foundation person sitting on every team                                  or anything like that it's sort of                                  melding in the org chart sense not in                                  the like                                  uh team people sense i don't know                                  i think that makes sense this metal                                  smithing situation is like extremely on                                  brand though just like for rust stuff so                                  we should we should come up with more                                  more metaphors here around that                                  one one thing we've toured around with                                  but i found it a helpful way of thinking                                  about things even though it's not                                  exactly right is sort of                                  the foundation as another team uh i                                  don't think they are exactly a team but                                  i think there is like a                                  because i know you're not gonna lie but                                  i do think there's like there are things                                  that are                                  kind of in the domain and decisions that                                  they make and they cooperate with the                                  other teams                                  in that sense of a player in the milieu                                  i was gonna say i don't think it's fair                                  to say that i don't like that nico                                  because i think                                  that i pitched that idea yesterday to                                  you if you like it even better you just                                  made it                                  the reason i made it face is that like                                  in one spirit                                  it's absolutely true and then in another                                  spirit it's                                  not which is just it the foundation is                                  another team                                  but it's also accepting all legal and                                  financial liability for the entire                                  organization which is like                                  a little different like just a                                  particularly prominent role                                  so like that's that's kind of like worth                                  calling out and so i guess                                  to a certain extent like i i really                                  think the spirit of it is that                                  they will meld but like if there's a                                  team that wants to like                                  do crimes like the foundation is gonna                                  probably oversee that um                                  so like maybe not so much with the doing                                  crimes but                                  uh and like you know if you're gonna try                                  and do something that might potentially                                  like financially bankrupt the                                  organization                                  like i think that's where you'll start                                  seeing stuff step in but like otherwise                                  there's like such a strong culture of                                  delegation                                  within the rust organization like i                                  don't know i've sat on foundation boards                                  before                                  uh they don't want to                                  to be like you know deciding what the                                  new cargo                                  command is like that's not like                                  we don't there's no worry there that                                  like they're gonna be supervising                                  something like that but i think that i                                  get like what florian said about the                                  release team for example right like that                                  we i agree the foundation has a special                                  role but i also think it's not unique to                                  the foundation that the teams have                                  sort of checks and balances amongst each                                  other and some amount of authority over                                  one another                                  right and that's kind of cool and makes                                  sense yeah                                  that was kind of where he was getting it                                  people always see like this this kind of                                  research                                  allocation and and budgeting as a bad                                  thing which will                                  certainly be something that the                                  foundation will be part of but                                  i actually like that that's a core part                                  of for example what i'm trying to teach                                  conferences                                  um that their budgeting is very                                  important and that their budgeting in                                  the end says what they'll be able to do                                  uh the reason why a lot of the                                  conferences in the rust world are able                                  to like it's common that                                  our conferences pay speakers uh which is                                  a huge debate in other communities and                                  now as it is and for the reason                                  um that a lot of the conferences and we                                  have a already have good ties that these                                  conversations                                  that these conversations happen that                                  conferences talk about                                  by the way the first thing you need to                                  have is budget and need to be clear uh                                  clear about money and um                                  the reason why i'm pulling that                                  experience in that strongly is because                                  um while there's a lot of projects in                                  the open source space that don't think a                                  lot about money                                  conferences actually do because                                  otherwise they're breaking bank very                                  hard                                  and um and that might have impact                                  like and this is why i'm talking to a                                  lot of these people um                                  because that might have impact to                                  volunteer organizers                                  if if they didn't make their budget                                  right but you can make a lot of things                                  happening with careful planning and this                                  is the                                  this is the role that i see there um and                                  of of making sure that we that we use                                  our resources effectively because they                                  fit it                                  that's like that's the they will always                                  be in some way definite                                  well i mean i would i would argue though                                  like you're you're right that                                  the economics of a conference are like                                  really obvious and like you can quickly                                  like break bank very easily to use your                                  words but um                                  i think that's true of building software                                  also                                  like we're just like breaking bank in                                  like way more insidious ways yes i'm                                  still going off                                  about the economics of open source i                                  feel like mark is rolling his eyes at me                                  but yes i am and i think that that's                                  really important and so having a                                  foundation means that instead of like                                  implicitly like participating                                  in this kind of open source economy we                                  can start trying to like                                  actively uh participate in it and like                                  be a lot more deliberate about that                                  stuff which i think is really important                                  yeah we do have                                  i mean i love this topic and go go off                                  forever but we have                                  a question from the comments that i                                  think might be cool to address                                  does anyone mind if i pop it up on the                                  screen i won't read it this time mark                                  all right let's see oh that's                                  it interesting okay it's different this                                  time                                  okay yeah and i'm glad it didn't like                                  cover you all up                                  sorry about that okay so let's see                                  any new or more complete learning                                  resources for rust                                  so actually this is something we talked                                  about uh quite a bit sort of before the                                  stream started                                  sort of on this idea of sort of                                  providing educational programs                                  uh so i'm wondering ashley if you want                                  to kick that off                                  oh gosh um yeah so                                  i do not think it is it would be the                                  scope of the foundation to necessarily                                  declare that there is a set of learning                                  resources that should exist and then                                  like                                  generate them on their own um this kind                                  of goes back to like the                                  there's not a difference from the                                  foundation in the project but i                                  i do know that the project has always                                  like really cared about                                  learning resources but we have kind of                                  sometimes struggled with those                                  uh because creating really good learning                                  learning resources can often take a lot                                  of resources and support                                  and so i i do think that the foundation                                  would be                                  like very eager to help support                                  maintainers create those                                  um and in particular it's interesting                                  here because when we talk about learning                                  there's so many different dimensions of                                  what learning can possibly mean within                                  the rust project and ecosystem like                                  learning could be like how do i learn                                  rust                                  and that's kind of the like kind of                                  first kind of sense of it                                  but there's also like how do i learn to                                  contribute to rust how do i learn                                  how to run a rust conference how do i                                  learn                                  how to advocate for my company to give                                  me open source time to work on rust                                  um there's so many different levels of                                  learning there                                  and i am excited to kind of infuse                                  this kind of area with some resources                                  because i think                                  i i think that there's a lot of really                                  neat opportunity for the rust project to                                  start generating some of those resources                                  so uh i guess there's like a yes                                  answer in here um but again with that                                  sense of mediation                                  where like the foundation isn't like                                  gonna write a book the foundation's                                  gonna help                                  the project right once                                  yeah so one thing that that popped up in                                  my head when you were                                  like covering all those subjects is um                                  these are a lot of high context things                                  where                                  for example we have the compiler dev                                  guide and how you hack on the compiler                                  it's a book                                  and this can only be written by people                                  that have deep knowledge of the compiler                                  how it works how the build process works                                  and                                  and what the flaws are currently so um                                  it would be very hard for                                  just saying like say we hire a person                                  who does this this is                                  just not possible because the person you                                  won't find a person that has                                  all these contacts and has all these                                  knowledges and that                                  comes back to the idea of supporting                                  maintainers how can we make sure                                  that maintainers can work on these                                  resources especially as we have a lot of                                  people that are very eager                                  to write these kind of things and                                  there's a culture of it but                                  for example i have never learned                                  technical writing or i had like a                                  weekend seminar on technical writing                                  before i                                  wrote my master thesis uh there's still                                  always people that ask me like could you                                  write this down like this is so                                  like this is a hard thing for me and i                                  think improving the situation where                                  people think about                                  do i want to write a book on this oh no                                  um                                  like i'm making to say do i want to                                  write a book about it yes i can do that                                  and i have support for that i know how                                  it works and this                                  and there's help for this um that's um                                  i think that will improve that situation                                  and um organizing these kind of things                                  like                                  i think that um oregon                                  that was one of the feedbacks that i                                  also got is like there's a lot of things                                  around                                  um and there's so much produced                                  every day that organization of this is                                  becoming an                                  effort like the constant of organization                                  and these are my rough thoughts when i                                  when i when i hear that                                  question uh about uh like especially                                  more complete what is complete                                  is complete you can find them all i                                  don't know                                  i yeah i don't know if we want to go to                                  another question or or                                  stay on this because i could go either                                  way but i have some thoughts                                  they're not super uh long                                  i think we should we should stay on this                                  so we should say this but we're getting                                  everybody's asking questions at the last                                  minute so i feel like we need to stay on                                  and like agree because someone actually                                  used our hashtag and i want to thank                                  them for doing so                                  longer i i was going to say two things                                  about                                  learning resources the first one is like                                  about the rusty dev guide                                  that florian was mentioning and                                  organization one of the really                                  interesting things we tried to do there                                  was                                  having sort of people who know that area                                  of the compiler will get sort of                                  interviewed by other people                                  who are going to work on the rusty dev                                  guide and we would record that interview                                  or do it like over text so that the                                  interview itself is a resource that you                                  can learn from immediately                                  and then it provides the raw material                                  that people                                  who uh who want to learn can use to like                                  write the text                                  and that but but making that kind of                                  thing happen is                                  is a lot of organizational work you have                                  to like schedule that you got to find                                  the people who are excited and really                                  you need to edit the content that's                                  coming out of it                                  uh and that that might be a place where                                  like there might be a role for the                                  foundation to help enable that                                  organizational work                                  um and and i think it's super exciting                                  and i love that idea because it just                                  worked like it just helps everybody in                                  so many different ways um                                  but the other thing i would say is that                                  i want to see some of that learning                                  going the other way i i've mentioned                                  this a few times but                                  i think it's pretty exciting for my                                  wearing my laying team hat to                                  uh think about learning from                                  people who teach rust uh and that's an                                  example where                                  again there's sort of organizational                                  relationships and organization                                  needed to bring that knowledge in but i                                  you know i'd like a much more                                  detailed look at what are the kinds of                                  things that people find really hard to                                  learn and how can we address them and                                  i get that by doing one-on-one mentoring                                  from time to time but there are people                                  who do that all the time                                  and they they have probably a much                                  better picture not to mention like                                  developing pedagogy                                  all that so forth i just                                  i i have to like be on air                                  enthusiastically                                  like supporting that idea i think                                  bringing teachers into                                  the language design room is like super                                  useful and i advocated for this when                                  i was uh an invited guest on on tc                                    um but i i think particularly for a                                  language right                                  like rust which has this kind of like                                  notorious learning curve                                  um i mean the other nice thing about                                  having                                  a like teachers committee or something                                  is that i as someone who used to be a                                  teacher we don't have a culture                                  of like rewarding and like lifting                                  teachers up into leadership positions                                  and like saying your experience is                                  important                                  so important that we think it is                                  critical                                  to like elevate your position and like                                  this like                                  one of the most important core                                  conversations in in a programming                                  language i think is                                  super useful there's only so many ways                                  to say thank you but like                                  saying thank you by like actually                                  empowering people to participate                                  i think is like i don't know i feel like                                  it's right on tone for                                  us and it's just something i wish i saw                                  more in the world                                  so i can definitely agree                                  um teaching rest my uh myself on                                  for example workshops um this the                                  one of the one of the things is that                                  there's there not many places where you                                  can exchange what other                                  teachers on uh what is hard for you                                  what's hard for me there's some things                                  that                                  are really really hard for me to explain                                  in rust                                  and then i talk to someone else and                                  they're like i got a five-minute                                  explanation                                  here this is this is how i do it and                                  then it sticks                                  and um so that will                                  um i'm trying to work around the word                                  multiplier                                  here                                  making sure that the this knowledge                                  travels                                  um will improve that situation that                                  situation a lot                                  well i was gonna say you missed it in                                  the last broadcast but nico absolutely                                  used the word                                  multiplier and i think we went into like                                                                       nonsense so it's cool                                                                                            teachers are already                                                  what a teacher is that                                                 it's                                                                      for okay                                  so thanks for all the teachers currently                                  we're working                                  yes shout out to teachers                                  um so we got a question on the hashtag                                  and i know we're a little over time but                                  it is a question that i actually haven't                                  heard                                  anybody ask us yet and it gives us an                                  opportunity to talk about an aspect of                                  the foundation                                  i've wanted to talk about um it's really                                  long which means i think                                  if i put it on the screen it's gonna                                  like mask                                  but let's see it's not gonna match past                                  me actually go ahead do it                                  okay that actually wasn't too bad                                  um so                                  i don't know mark if you want to intro                                  the question yeah so                                  uh sure uh has been sort of under                                  maintained for a while                                  while folks are free to fork it without                                  official backing forking might just make                                  matters worse                                  any thoughts on that so actually you                                  clearly have thoughts                                  well i always have thoughts it's true                                  um so the thing i want to say is                                  i i don't want to give any sort of                                  definitive or non-definitive answer                                  about the maintenance status of surday                                  uh but what i i can call out is i have                                  rust crates that have                                  extremely questionable maintenance and                                  we can use those to talk about it                                  instead of                                  potentially calling out on surveys so we                                  can talk about ashley's crates and how                                  completely under-maintained they are um                                  and i think what this talks about is so                                  a thing we haven't said                                  about the russ foundation is that the                                  rust foundation is going to kind of have                                  the rust project and the rust project                                  contains multitudes                                  and one of those multitudes is craze io                                  and cargo uh                                  and i love package management i'm                                  gonna retire and become a ups driver                                  probably uh                                  but uh like that one of the key                                  decisions with releasing rust was that                                  we're gonna have a first class package                                  manager                                  and that what a first class package                                  manager really means                                  is that your ecosystem of packages is                                  also                                  a first-class feature of the language                                  which means you                                  if you're not trying to figure out how                                  to better support your ecosystem authors                                  and like focusing                                  not just on the project sustainability                                  but like understanding                                  that the ecosystem sustainability is                                  part of your project sustainability                                  like if you're not doing that you're                                  making a huge mistake so                                  for the very first like when we open the                                  doors to the                                  not physical foundation uh in in january                                  um this will not be fully established                                  but                                  i                                                                 focus on supporting ecosystem authors                                  here                                  uh in the foundation is is going to be a                                  really critical thing there's some                                  models out there that exist                                  like one of the things that i think                                  would be a huge mistake and completely                                  not in the spirit of rust would be to                                  have                                  our ecosystem packages have to compete                                  with the rust                                  like language itself for resources that                                  is                                  not an alignment of incentives that i am                                  interested in and i don't want that to                                  happen because                                  these things work together they don't                                  work without the other                                  and so i think that we need to create an                                  affordance of supporting these things                                  that's aligned                                  how you pull this off is is always very                                  interesting                                  i think um and we want to be able to                                  maintain obviously the independence of                                  ecosystem authors and things like that                                  uh but it's something i'm                                  really excited to to kind of work with                                  the foundation to figure out how to                                  design                                  just because i think it's really                                  important and the last thing i'll say is                                  here it says                                  you're free to fork it but that just                                  might might make matters worse                                  um yeah i uh i talked about space                                  communism                                  but uh earlier but like yes you can                                  always fork and forking is not always                                  this like huge evil thing that i think a                                  lot of people talk about                                  but it's always been the                                  vibe of rust at least in my opinion that                                  in situations where we can work together                                  we would prefer to work together um                                  and it just turns out that sometimes                                  working together it takes a lot of                                  effort                                  like i know i have some crates for                                  example where they are under maintained                                  and folks                                  there's folks who want to help and it's                                  it actually takes a lot of work to try                                  and set up a system where                                  folks can work to help together um and                                  it's also that type of support that i                                  could imagine the foundation could help                                  off                                  uh like offer maintainers but i think                                  there's a lot of stuff here but                                  just to say like yes like this is a key                                  thing at least top of my mind                                  so i'll pick up the ball and talk about                                  my own crates as well                                  because i i actually have a own a crate                                  that is the seventh fork um where                                  someone dropped out of maintenance and                                  it's it's in the exec ecosystem so it                                  had to be forward port edge due to new                                  things um until finally in                                       that that whole thing called down and                                  was possible to write stable crates                                  in any case and                                  i've tried to research ways on how this                                  project evolution goes and how the                                  handover goes and                                  found that there's not a lot of                                  structure in open source project                                  currently and not a lot of public                                  writing or support writing                                  around how do you evolve a project                                  up on to yourself leaving the project a                                  lot of there's a lot of writing on how                                  do you enter open source there's not a                                  lot of writing on how you evolve and how                                  you                                  for example move personally out of it                                  and one of the big problems why i'm                                  currently not handing over                                  maintainership                                  is for the reason that i don't want the                                  next person to fall into the same trap                                  um and that's my that's my main fear is                                  like                                  will i just be out and the next person                                  just being the person that doesn't have                                  that does not have enough time for                                  for this grade um so there's a lot of                                  subtlety around this                                  issue but i also think there's a lot of                                  opportunity                                  um to to fix that and there have been a                                  number of studies recently that                                  uh that exactly talk to what the exact                                  problem there is and um                                  um project reference are actually                                  one of the big problems um these are                                  things                                  that um currently people basically have                                  to solve by themselves without a lot of                                  uh without a lot of reference to be had                                  so um also again without                                  talking uh um talking about any                                  uh specific things we're also seeing                                  this um                                  within uh within the rus project a                                  little in                                  where um i think                                  talking about um about support                                  structures                                  how do we support people in the whole                                  travel through the rust project                                  and and yeah and help them making sure                                  that for example they compare                                  their components they maintained um when                                  they move out and that there's a                                  conscious process around all of these                                  things                                  and um that will both give                                  the project resilience and people safety                                  yeah shout out to emily dunham's blog                                  post that i reread yesterday and was                                  like man this is such a good pose                                  um about consciously stepping back from                                  things i was gonna say you gotta say                                  what it is                                  um maybe i'll try and post it up on the                                  screen because it is amazing                                  i remember the name is the problem so                                  yeah if you can find it that'd be                                  awesome but                                  i have just one thing to add which is i                                  think you guys pretty much nailed it but                                  i wanted to add that this is like the                                  this is a good example i think of                                  something that we did not                                  try to solve now but that we wanted to                                  create                                  we totally think is in scope and we want                                  to have a structure that is                                  able to address it but there's no way we                                  could have                                  done it up front right and some of the                                  things that ashley was talking about                                  about you know supporting maintainers                                  and we definitely think the foundation                                  has a role there but it's                                  it's going to be up to the foundation to                                  and uh                                  project you know to work together and                                  figure out what that is                                  and the best way to do that is                                  okay so um let's close out wait                                  i just wanted to quickly say this is the                                  blog post                                  emily dunham uh the title                                  is thoughts on retiring from a team                                  i would say this is like one of the                                  healthiest open source                                  perspectives i have read in a while it's                                  from                                                                      today so i think anybody who's tuning in                                  give it a read shout out to eden                                  which is great all right                                  i'm done interrupting i'm sorry okay uh                                  so to close this out uh since we're a                                  little overtime already and                                  you know probably some of us need to                                  get started with our day which is sort                                  of awkward but you know it's                                  it's only been an hour um                                  let's see okay so what does success look                                  like for the foundation                                  joyful happy maintainers                                  i need to say that with more enthusiasm                                  niko                                  joyful happy maintainers oh okay someone                                  is gonna remix that                                  into yeah you're gonna get auto-tuned i                                  mean i'm excited for it honestly                                  gonna be on one of the artist sets in                                  one of the conferences                                  and the javascript conferences would                                  always take sound bites from                                  my conference socks and like put them                                  into songs uh but not tell me so it'd be                                  like a surprise like when the conference                                  kicks off anyways                                  so for me success of the rest foundation                                  would actually                                  look like that at some point in the near                                  to mid future                                  people will be able to see our practices                                  check them and adopt them as much as                                  we're adopting other practices the worst                                  project has always adopted a lot of                                  practices from our background                                  and for me a successful foundation and                                  like the the checking point for this is                                  successful                                  is other projects looking at what we do                                  taking that                                  and take putting it into their own                                  structures like not                                  carbon copy but be like this is good i                                  really want that i think this is a                                  this is a good thing um and that's for                                  me                                  like i think the most approachable way                                  to check a                                  is the successful                                  yeah i classically i feel like i'm maybe                                  too                                  on theme but one of the things i'm                                  particularly excited about                                  is                                  like i i want there to be a future where                                  where people who are interested in                                  contributing to open source                                  end up wanting to contribute to the rust                                  project in particular                                  uh be because                                  being a contributor is like potentially                                  a career it's it's so well resourced                                  it's like why you might you know                                  pick one airline over another which is                                  just like the the rust project like                                  being a contributor to there is just                                  like                                  it's nice um i want i want it to feel                                  really good and i think that to a                                  certain extent like we kind of already                                  have that i mean there's a lot of like                                  understanding that the attitude that our                                  our leaders and our our maintainers have                                  is really positive                                  um but i i see so much more room for                                  growth there                                  uh and so yeah i mean this is the                                  just very long version of nico's soon to                                  be auto-tuned response about happy                                  joyful maintainers but like also                                  yes happy joyful maintainers uh in a way                                  that like                                  people want to be doing it i                                  i forget exactly what it was and this is                                  like a quote                                  me quoting florian quoting nadia engball                                  but the idea that                                  most maintainers maintain their open                                  source out of guilt                                  like i know i said this in the last room                                  too but like i feel this                                  so hard i talked about my unmaintained                                  crates                                  um it's like a constant source of                                  anxiety i guess i've                                  said this a lot i have an anxiety                                  problem um but                                  uh like i i want there to be a different                                  future there and i think that the rust                                  foundation gets to be                                  a player in building that and so the                                  closer we get to that future like the                                  more it feels like success to me                                  i yeah that all sounds great to me                                  anyway                                  um i guess i don't know how are we                                  closing this out                                  uh officially we don't have like a next                                  session so i can't reference anything                                  i guess you can uh ashley can we get the                                  like faq link on the screen so that                                  people can                                  read more background information                                  from like closing out music                                  you up the final countdown or whatever                                  uh the final content is not the closing                                  of music                                  the final countdown is actually the                                  video that needs to be posted five                                  minutes before the community meeting                                  i was explaining this to nico the other                                  day that we used to do that before every                                  community team meeting we'd do a little                                  countdown and everyone would post                                  not just the final countdown but like                                  weird covers of the final i like i feel                                  like i learned                                  like we sat solved that song like all                                  the different                                  possible permutations of presenting the                                  final countdown                                  uh that's a good good thing so                                  um i mean i guess we can say a couple                                  things about what's coming in the future                                  right                                  my dog it's like i'm like i will say                                  something meaningful now and i                                  was like no you won't or i'll make it                                  difficult uh                                  so we have at least uh maybe                                  a few blog posts that we're gonna come                                  out with                                  next week and then uh we kind of hit                                  this                                  golf of holiday season but                                  we're gonna kick off and we're gonna be
