                 conversation so                               first off i want to kick off by thanking                               everyone for                               being here and

our thinking                                as we sort of announce all of this and                                the first thing i want to do is talk                                about sort of where you can find all of                                the                                details here uh so we have the project                                uh                                sort

rust for a long                                time now going since                                     so been a while                                and and what is your involvement in the

helping to set up the foundation i'm                                in the foundation project group in                                particular                                uh maybe that's what you're looking for                                and i uh                                and um yeah that's that's what i'm                                doing                                um hi i'm ashley williams i                                i'm on the ros core team i've been a                                member of                                many teams over the years um but                                at this point my role on core takes up                                almost all of my time and i've also been                                working on the                                at the rust foundation project group                                doing all sorts of things                                okay well um i don't know i guess we can                                get started um                                so the first thing i want to do is ask                                ashley                                so a lot of people have been sort of                                interested in this what is the                                foundation for                                what are we doing uh why are we even you                                know setting up a foundation                                uh who are we doing it for uh so i                                you know and let's uh talk about that um                                i guess let's start off with sort of                                this                                more broad question of why are we                                setting up a foundation                                why are we setting up a foundation um                                well there's there's a lot of answers to                                that that involve                                uh many strange things that happened                                over the course of                                     um but i i think that the the really                                positive answer here                                is rust is growing                                really really rapidly and uh we've kind                                of                                gotten to the point where it's it's time                                for us to kind of own our own                                independent kind of structure uh and and                                this is                                this is partially because um you know                                we're seeing a lot of attention from a                                lot of folks wanting to                                to use rust and we're because of our                                team structure we're like incredibly                                large and distributed set of teams that                                kind of management and operations                                necessary for the type of project like                                for us                                is just incredibly huge um and so                                i i don't know if this is perhaps what                                 you're getting at but                                 from this you might gather that we are                                 not setting up a foundation to drive                                 adoption of rust um we we have the                                 really lucky problem that                                 rust is getting adopted completely on                                 its own and so                                 the real goal of the foundation is to                                 help the project cope uh                                 with that exponential growth and                                 adoption                                 nico do you have anything to add on that                                 point                                 yes i think i do i would say i think one                                 of the things i'm really excited about                                 with the foundation                                 is we've seen a lot of adoption of rust                                 and what i'm really excited to see is                                 have us go from a phase                                 of companies using rust the companies                                 getting involved                                 in us at a deeper level right and that's                                 been happening kind of                                 slowly slowly slowly and i think we're                                 going to see it pick up a lot with the                                 foundation and i'm pretty excited i                                 think that's going to bring a lot of                                 [Music]                                 you know a lot of lots of things a lot                                 of resources but a lot of people and a                                 lot of                                 interaction and uh more collaboration                                 and i think it's gonna be good for us                                 yeah so to lead up on uh sort of follow                                 up on that um                                 sort of a lot of us have been on the                                 project and i know myself                                 thinking sort of how is this you know                                 big effort going to                                 touch on my work in the project um and                                 i'm wondering ashley if you can                                 sort of talk a little bit about how sort                                 of the individual people working in rust                                 and sort of making                                 pull requests or translating or                                 moderating and sort of all the great                                 work those teams do                                 uh what what what can they expect                                 yeah um well i think it's interesting                                 it's definitely not going to be like the                                 flick of a light switch right like it's                                 not going to be                                 like we've incorporated a foundation and                                 then like everyone goes oh                                 and it's like suddenly i don't know                                 everything that we type                                 is covered in glitter or something i                                 mean that's not that's not a bad idea                                 actually i'll i'll pose that to the                                 foundation                                 um                                 [Laughter]                                 yeah we just got to send glitter bombs                                 to all of the the two maintainers um                                 uh but i i would say and i i think                                 to any of the maintainers out here                                 listening um                                 i think i think over the particularly                                 the last two to three years                                 uh as as rust's community has grown                                 tremendously                                 uh these like the true like openness                                 of rust uh which is a value that                                 everyone                                 really really loves about rust um                                 the cost of that value is something that                                 we've been feeling pretty hard                                 uh and it's it's tough because it's hard                                 when something that you                                 like really love so much uh kind of ends                                 up hurting you                                 uh and and so i think what we've seen                                 with our maintainers is                                 that they're really feeling this really                                 classic kind of asymmetrical power                                 structure that open source                                 shows up which is that uh to a certain                                 extent                                 uh success uh can lead to like some                                 really intense failure                                 failure moments because uh you can end                                 up with so many more users and you have                                 maintainers                                 and and so what i would say is as you've                                 been working on rust you have almost                                 certainly been feeling                                 some pinches uh as as you've been                                 participating and                                 and i think it's really the goal of the                                 foundation to help us                                 identify those pinches and and try to                                 alleviate them                                 uh this is a a very blunt kind of                                 example but you know i i think we've                                 talked about having                                 rfcs with with                                                          we go oh my goodness                                                                                                 with the way we're seeing russ grow                                 today like                                 we're going to end up with an rfc with                                                                                    we're not we're not ready to handle that                                 um and i don't want our maintainership                                 to have to handle that with no resources                                 on its own                                 and so um i'm i'm really excited because                                 i think                                 figuring out how to scale that                                 open consensus like value                                 in rust is like really going to be one                                 of the biggest charges of the foundation                                 i know i'm excited do you want to                                 talk about uh some of these pinches that                                 you've been feeling and                                 how excited you are about getting them                                 solved                                 yes i do i i'm so i think there's                                 there's a lot of levels                                 right and and one of the things i mean                                 there's kind of some very easy very                                 tangible                                 benefits i think we can expect from                                 having a foundation i think                                 we'll be able to coordinate resources uh                                 one thing that people ask for a lot when                                 they come to contribute to the compiler                                 the first thing they notice                                 is like oh it takes a really long time                                 and stuff like that and they notice                                 uh yeah or or                                 or it takes a lot of memory and things                                 like that and one of the things we've                                 picked around is i wonder if we could                                 set up                                 like some way to help people get bills                                 and i don't know if we'll                                 do that in the foundation or not but it                                 seems like with a foundation we can have                                 that conversation and we can start                                 looking around for maybe you can do                                 cloud builds or something like that                                 right but                                 that kind of thing is like the obvious                                 level and i'm i'm pretty excited about                                 it i think we're going to probably find                                 a lot of those little things we can do                                 with resources that we didn't have that                                 will make a big difference                                 um what's going to be a little bit the                                 next level up let's say                                 is really focusing on the pathway                                 from beginning contributor all the way                                 up                                 to like uh sort of team lead                                 or whatever and and seeing at each point                                 in that step                                 are there kind of organizational things                                 we can do or blockers we can remove                                 um that were that were limiting us                                 before and it's something we've we've                                 put energy into but                                 i think we found it hard to keep that                                 sustained focus                                 and i think the foundation will help us                                 do that and i'm pretty excited i think                                 that's gonna be                                 like uh i                                 i keep having the feeling that with all                                 the excitement and all the people who                                 are                                 coming in to rust we                                 if we can find ways to kind of capture                                 more of that and take advantage of more                                 of that we're going to be able to do                                 a lot of stuff and that that's sometimes                                 i feel like we lose some of it on the                                 side so we just can't get it                                 organizationally uh together to                                 take advantage of people and they wind                                 up getting frustrated they go off and                                 watch netflix                                 whatever they do instead of                                 is that what you do to go                                 no comment                                 nothing wrong with watching netflix                                 the compiler builds are very long so i                                 don't know like netflix is sometimes a                                 valid strategy for you know                                 as you wait for that build i i have had                                 the                                 compiler in the streaming thing                                 parallel definitely more than once                                 so ashley one thing i'm wondering sort                                 of nico has talked about how we can sort                                 of utilize this infrastructure                                 and i think we sort of have talked a                                 little bit about sort of the                                 i don't know more mundane infrastructure                                 but one thing we haven't really touched                                 on is sort of                                 the more human side of like can we                                 expect mentoring or maybe                                 some resources for moderation team or                                 you know even                                 you know parachuting in people with                                 skills that maybe we don't really know                                 about especially for our volunteers                                 i'm just imagining like a parachute that                                 has the rust logo on it                                 and it's like really good like a maybe                                 even a ferro-shaped parachute that                                 sounds                                 awesome um someone who's a balloon maker                                 get on that                                 uh but yeah i mean the the metaphor the                                 core team often uses in their rust comp                                 keynote is like uh                                 like people systems like we're people                                 systems programmers to a certain extent                                 and uh i think to the same way that we                                 can we can look forward to the                                 foundation being able to                                 to to be able to you know support and                                 and produce um                                 some some infrastructure that is sorely                                 needed for maintainers i                                 i also when i think about the sk the                                 sheer scale of the people we have                                 um there's also a fair amount of people                                 infrastructure that i think would really                                 benefit from                                 and so one of the effects of the                                 extremely distributed team structure                                 that we have that i think a lot of                                 people don't think about a lot is                                 because we have                                 so many independent teams that means                                 that the rust organizational structure                                 actually demands significantly more                                 contributors that are                                 managers than ever like in in many open                                 source projects                                 uh and uh being a manager is a real                                 skill                                 um you can't just kind of like wake up                                 one day and do it i feel like management                                 is kind of like                                 uh design and teaching where like kind                                 of at first glance you're like oh i                                 could probably do that                                 and then you start doing it and you're                                 like oh my goodness there's a lot of                                 subtlety                                 here and so uh as as we continue to                                 think about having to                                 to scale the growing rust project um                                 i i we see a lot of people stepping up                                 into leadership roles and                                 they kind of step up into like a void uh                                 and i i think that it would be really                                 helpful                                 if there was more of a like a guided                                 moment where we could offer leadership                                 training                                 management training and and like also                                 just resources for                                 for helping manage these things from                                 basic things like project management to                                 i think potentially more interesting                                 things if you think about like product                                 management                                 management and like even design work                                 like there's there's a lot of really                                 fascinating organizational                                 research out there about how to do that                                 and uh well russ doesn't                                 do a lot of inventing technology from                                 first principles                                 i do think just because of a lack of                                 resources we've invented a fair amount                                 of management from first principles and                                 with the foundation i i look forward to                                 one being able to bring in                                 sponsors who have like a depth of                                 knowledge there that we'll be able to                                 learn from                                 uh but also just to be able to gain                                 resources and and help to                                 distribute those to to the folks that                                 are uh                                 kind of find themselves as the leader uh                                 in a way that they might not have                                 expected                                 yeah i'll chime in and say one of the                                 things                                 that you made me think of there actually                                 is in the compiler team you know we've                                 set up a bunch of                                 uh working groups and so on and one of                                 the observations we made                                 kind of coming at the i don't remember                                 when this was                                 last time we we had like a retro or                                 something we were discussing                                 what the uh what was our experience and                                 and one of the biggest problems was                                 yeah basically being the lead of a                                 working group is really hard                                 and that there was just you know it                                 takes a lot of energy                                 of course and and keeping on top of                                 things but also that there's a need                                 to kind of guide people and give them                                 more structure                                 of how to do it of how you know help                                 maybe help to break down                                 well this is the task you want to                                 achieve let's sharpen that let's figure                                 out the steps we can actually use                                 and we've talked a lot about how to                                 achieve it and i'm not sure exactly                                 you know it's still going to be an open                                 problem we'll be iterating on for a                                 while but i feel pretty confident that                                 like                                 we will find that the foundation helps                                 us                                 here and offers us some some                                 tools that we were lacking um another                                 thing that                                 i was just thinking about is that i                                 think would be great                                 uh is getting you know this this product                                 management that you mentioned getting                                 help in                                 kind of assessing people's needs um and                                 making sure we're doing a really good                                 thorough job of that                                 so we can figure out what to prioritize                                 i don't know                                 i think that's been a challenge for us                                 sometimes so there's so many wonderful                                 things to do                                 when you say people's needs are you                                 talking about maintainers there or                                 sort of the general rust community or                                 which constituency i know i'm the worst                                 i know                                 i'm i'm talking about so what am i                                 talking about                                 i'm talking about all the needs i think                                 we should assess everyone's                                 uh i'm talking about um i think                                 maintainers                                 could use help in assessing users is                                 actually what i'm saying so there is a                                 maintainer's need at the root here                                 um but uh                                 it is related to end users and things                                 like that as well                                 so i think we we do things like                                 we use the survey and well anyway we                                 have                                 we make a lot of attempts and we do                                 really work at it but it's a tricky                                 topic                                 so along those lines of sort of survey                                 work and and others                                 um sort of figuring out how do end users                                 fit into the                                 foundation and and there's this question                                 to some extent of                                 sort of we're focusing so much on                                 maintainers                                 um and and maintainers definitely want                                 to focus on end users too                                 but i think at least for me one of the                                 questions i've had is sort of                                 how do we fit this structure of                                 maintainers focusing on                                 end users and foundation and sort of                                 what is the relationship we're looking                                 there for um                                 especially as we think about sort of our                                 purpose being maintainers but then                                 sort of feels like why are we focusing                                 on maintainers and users right we want                                 to drive                                 uh people to be enthusiastic about rust                                 not not about                                 rust development so much                                 yeah it it definitely could seem maybe                                 somewhat                                 backwards to have a foundation that is                                 is focused on the maintainers like                                 maybe not even backwards maybe even                                 worse like maybe selfish like                                 oh the rust project wants to create a                                 foundation                                 for itself um                                 and i i know at least for me like part                                 of this is motivated by                                 what i've seen as as trends kind of                                 in what i'd call like the economics of                                 open source                                 uh where there there's these                                 these affordances for expectations where                                 in in many circumstances like especially                                 i'd say like                                 commercial software uh like the users                                 are                                 are often the the least well-served                                 constituency they're given the                                 the least power the least visibility and                                 i i would say in open source uh                                 open source maintainers don't really hit                                 the top of the list                                 for any of those things either and and                                 part of that's because many people have                                 kind of aliased open source to be free                                 um                                 and uh there's there's like just an                                 expectation that                                 the project is there and it's there for                                 the taking and that those people's time                                 um uh they they owe you uh                                 like they owe their users stuff and so                                 there there's that kind of in the                                 background there's been some                                 some really interesting writing on it i                                 think nadia engball uh kind of bringing                                 about like the                                 the un unspoken infrastructure of open                                 source but                                 i don't know there's some stat about                                 like most people maintain open source                                 out of guilt                                 and i think that that's like just really                                 really sad                                 um and i gotta be honest i have                                 absolutely felt that way before                                 uh and and what i realized is that with                                 foundations if                                 if the goal of the foundation is is to                                 to support adoption and support end                                 users                                 um there's there's a weird distrust                                 there whereas we need an organization                                 uh to center the users and tell the                                 developers what to do and                                 that i i think that's just not really                                 aligned with rust values at all                                 i think that uh i think that if we keep                                 the folks who are working on rust well                                 resourced                                 well supported and happy they're gonna                                 build the best rust for end users that's                                 possible                                 and i don't think a separate                                 organization                                 uh is is is going to to really be able                                 to move the needle on that i think the                                 folks that are                                 are working on the projects really                                 understand the problems and are                                 incredibly motivated to build something                                 that's powerful and ergonomic and                                 that what's really just getting in their                                 way is is                                 are these systems that that uh                                 i mean these systems that that make                                 their job incredibly difficult to do                                 because they are but one person and                                 there is an intensely                                 large growing number of people using                                 rust so to kind of balance that equation                                 i think having the foundation on those                                 folks side is                                 is going to be how we end up with with                                 the absolute best trust                                 yeah so as as you've you know referenced                                 economics here i think the obvious                                 question to everyone is                                 sort of can maintainers expect to be                                 paid by the foundation is that what                                 we're going for here or                                 what's the story for maintainers like                                 i've i've been talking a lot i don't                                 know you should                                 talk about this curious                                 the answer is uh largely no but                                 we're not the the role of foundation is                                 not to directly hire                                 people let's say to hire everyone who                                 works on rust and                                 and we there's a lot of reasons for this                                 i mean i think a big part of it is                                 we we just couldn't do a very good job                                 like there's a lot of people working on                                 rust and it would take a lot of                                 managerial infrastructure and                                 it's it's a hard thing to uh to hire and                                 really maintain someone very well                                 right and what we would do a much better                                 job                                 of doing is incentivizing people who                                 work like companies that rely on rust                                 and helping them                                 and getting them to hire developers and                                 support those developers which they're                                 already geared up to do right                                 and i think that has a side benefit                                 which is that                                 where rust how rust will work best how                                 open source works best                                 in my opinion is when you have kind of a                                 lot of companies coming                                 not just companies really a lot of                                 people and contributors from different                                 backgrounds which may include companies                                 coming together to work uh and solve                                 you know common problems right and i                                 think that's                                 that's what like when we made things                                 like the rfc process with russ we did                                 that because we knew that                                 uh we needed input from all kinds of                                 people if we're going to make these                                 designs good or else they're just going                                 to be tailored to like                                 the side of the problem that you see you                                 the                                 youth designer and not the other                                 constraints that you're not aware of                                 um and i think if we tried to just                                 pay everyone from one central source                                 that                                 would step right into that trap not to                                 mention that it just wouldn't work                                 it's not to say we can't pay anyone i                                 think there's definitely a role for                                 for hiring people and but we would be                                 looking for                                 you know critical roles that enable                                 kind of enabling roles                                 uh like infrastructure based is the most                                 obvious one i think                                 i was gonna say multipliers and then i                                 was gonna make a joke about                                     programmers                                 i was looking i was debating whether yes                                 but we're all multipliers anyone who                                 works on rust is a multiplier right                                 yeah i agree with that building a tool                                 that everyone uses                                 um but yes we will be picking and                                 choosing very carefully the rules                                 i think that make the most sense for the                                 foundation to do specifically                                 yeah i want to go back to the thing that                                 you touched on about                                 um incentivizing companies to to hire                                 folks who are working on rust so one of                                 the things that you see a lot when an                                 open source technology starts getting                                 really popular                                 uh is so you start out you've got a                                 programming language there's kind of the                                 early adopters the early hackers that                                 are like getting really into it working                                 directly on it                                 and slowly that becomes something that                                 that folks are really excited about                                 and companies start going i want to                                 write my software in this                                 and they go who better to write this                                 software                                 than the person who wrote this language                                 that would be a really great idea                                 and it is a really amazing idea but what                                 can happen if you're not careful                                 is that then all the people who are                                 working on the language                                 suddenly head on out to all of these                                 companies to work on that product                                 and there's nobody left working on the                                 language                                 you kind of see this moment when this                                 adoption happens and you have this kind                                 of brain drain                                 and so i think one of the critical                                 things for the rust foundation to be                                 doing                                 in particular is to be creating a system                                 of affordances                                 that that really incentivizes folks to                                 invest                                 in keeping engineers working on                                 the rust programming language and i                                 think some of the old models                                 of just assuming that those folks will                                 want to do that                                 like purely on a volunteer basis when                                 say a company might want to offer them                                 like a very high salary to                                 to say work on the product instead um i                                 think that that's really difficult and                                 so i                                 i think it is the the russ foundation's                                 responsibility and and the folks who are                                 participating in it                                 to make sure that we're able to keep                                 working on rust itself                                 not working in rust um                                 and a really attractive option because                                 i what you'll often see is you you have                                 that                                 that language everybody leaves to go                                 work in that language                                 and then eventually that language starts                                 kind of losing                                 that awesome value uh that made                                 everybody want to write stuff in it in                                 the first place and so                                 this is really a critical moment to like                                 make us like                                 that we're we're to pass like we're                                 really gonna need to figure out how to                                 do that                                 uh retention um and i think it's really                                 interesting but                                 like i see it as one of the the most                                 important roles for the foundation to                                 really                                 focus on making sure that's the case and                                 and if it's not we're going to fix it                                 i think it's even maybe a little more                                 than just incentivizing but but also                                 guiding                                 and like helping people understand what                                 the right way to                                 to interact with the project and so                                 forth is                                 um that requires a lot of engagement                                 but yeah i i                                 i it's speaking to the rust community                                 out there i                                 i don't think you know how intimidating                                 to a certain extent you are                                 you're like the the values driven like                                 community that we've built                                 um i folks really respect it and                                 they are they are they're                                 they're they're cautious about making                                 sure they participate they really want                                 to make sure that we preserve it as we                                 go through this kind of like                                 next moment for rust                                 now so we've talked quite a bit about                                 sort of the more concrete benefits in                                 some sense but we haven't really talked                                 or                                 a lot about the sort of shape of how the                                 foundation is going to                                 maybe influence decisions or sort of                                 make changes in the project                                 um and sort of the systems like if i'm a                                 maintainer                                 who do i go to uh how do i make this you                                 know proposal or whatever                                 um nico do you want to                                 talk a little bit about this there's not                                 that much to say                                 uh uh i mean i think                                 the foundation is there to support this                                 teams that we have built not to sort of                                 replace them                                 or change the way that they work right                                 it's not going to change the way the rfc                                 process works                                 so the board isn't the board isn't gonna                                 make async a postfix                                 operate now                                 uh no i don't think so                                 [Music]                                 i i think yeah like certainly like                                 technical decision making but not just                                 technical just the decision making the                                 teams have been doing stays with the                                 teams                                 uh but what they now have that they                                 didn't have before                                 is kind of uh more more resources that                                 they can                                 draw on right and they have a new a new                                 kind of                                 way to enable them and i think                                 that you know exactly how much and how                                 we lean on it will depend team to team                                 and                                 it's something we're going to be                                 figuring out but that's the way to think                                 about it                                 ashley do you do you want to elaborate                                 on that or do you think that covered it                                 is there more to say i mean                                 i i definitely think like russ has built                                 out a really fantastic                                 set of governance and honestly with my                                 experience with foundations and boards                                 like a a single board on a foundation                                 wouldn't be able to make all the                                 decisions that the rust project's able                                 to make like                                 if it meets like say once a month even                                 like the number of decisions that our                                 our governance is making due today um                                 even if we were to somehow decide that                                 we wanted that to happen                                 i i think it would be impossible so um                                 but that's that's                                 really not the the type of decision                                 making that that                                 that the foundation uh will be making i                                 think instead it's gonna be                                 a lot more about thinking about how can                                 we make strategic                                 investments in in the organization so                                 that that                                 that folks can feel like that                                 contributing to rust is                                 is improving and is is like a joy i                                 think as nico                                 likes to say i do like the word joy                                 joyful contribution yeah um                                 i think that's right yeah i mean i guess                                 one thing                                 i feel like nico and mark can be like                                 ashley why are you doing this                                 um here okay i'll do i'll just do it                                 yeah i know right so one of the really                                 interesting things about our                                 extremely distributed governance system                                 is that decision making                                 is a is is again distributed to a large                                 number                                 of teams um and and the strength of rust                                 is in the strength of those teams and                                 and as we scale                                 and as we see adoption of rust uh                                 i i think that we've already been                                 feeling pressure on that governance                                 and so i think if you want to be worried                                 i think the thing to be worried about is                                 not necessarily that the foundation is                                 going to take things over                                 but that uh rus governance is not                                 going to have the support and the                                 resources it needs to be able to                                 scale to the amount of people that are                                 are coming in                                 like one of the things that open source                                 projects usually like to see is like oh                                 my gosh like let's get more and more                                 contributors let's see that contributor                                 graph go up um and i have to assume that                                 if i were to show a graph like that                                 there would be a not insignificant                                 number of our maintainers who would go                                 oh my goodness                                 and that's really too bad because i                                 think in our hearts we really want                                 contributing to recipes something that                                 everybody can do um                                 but our current governance structures                                 and management structures are                                 are really not ready to be able to like                                 handle that influx yet                                 and so what i'm really looking forward                                 to                                 is getting to a place where we can beef                                 up is a horrible                                 metaphor for someone who is vegetarian                                 to say and but i feel like we've been                                 using a lot in the core team lately i                                 don't know                                 who started that but anyways like really                                 looking to                                 to mature our our governance process um                                 two to one here just saying what                                 i said we outnumber the either the                                 carnivores in this call if i'm not                                 mistaken                                 but are you just trying to say that mark                                 eats me no no meat shaming                                 into the live broadcast nico we didn't                                 talk about this                                 oh my goodness um anyways                                 what i'm trying to say is that uh                                 the the the chronic problem that we                                 should be worried about when we think                                 about decision making in the rust                                 project                                 is i or the thing that we should be                                 worried about is not the idea that the                                 foundation                                 is going to decide to introduce a new                                 keyword it's that                                 our our governance structures are not                                 going to scale at the rate that they                                 need to and                                 mature in a way that will be able to                                 maintain our values                                 um and so i feel like everyone's going                                 to be like ashley are you like a cloud                                 ceo                                 now because you said scale like                                     times somebody make the meme about like                                 is rust web scale please                                 um it's a this is a bad idea anyways                                 uh like that's the thing that keeps me                                 up at night is like how are we gonna                                 how are we gonna keep these teams                                 operating um                                 and and give them the capacity that they                                 need for like the next five years of                                 rest                                 and so that's why when i think about                                 decision making the foundation                                 doesn't make me as scared uh because i                                 see it as a way to                                 help us uh solve the other problem i'm                                 worried about                                 yeah that is definitely a rising and                                 growing challenge i think it is                                 something                                 i mean it's a place we put a lot of                                 energy and we will continue to do so                                 and i think we're making a lot of                                 progress uh at adapting our processes to                                 the                                 to the sort of both                                 it's not just about more and more people                                 coming in right it's about                                 sort of having to juggle more and more                                 complex constraints and                                 i don't know it seems like as rust is                                 getting maybe it's just my                                 my perspective where i'm coming from but                                 i like the part of russ that i'm working                                 on the most but i feel like                                 you know for one thing as                                 the margin as rust is getting more and                                 more used in production                                 uh we have to kind of ensure we keep the                                 quality higher on a constant basis                                 and we have                                 we have to meet we have to make sure                                 we're considering as we are designing                                 these newer features and so on                                 like taking into account all the                                 different ways people might use them i                                 think the async design is a good example                                 it just had                                 an enormous number of constraints trying                                 to be met                                 it was very complicated uh a long time                                 and had a lot of                                 uh back and forth and                                 that that was a big challenge um that                                 really                                 that i think we we met very well but                                 that                                 was harder than other kinds of designs                                 we've had to do where we were smaller                                 and had                                 been able to move more nimbly                                 yeah i think that makes sense as as we                                 think about like                                 making rust ergonomic uh                                 like i always say like ergonomics is                                 familiarity and so as the                                 user base of rust grows and diversifies                                 and the types of things that people are                                 using rust for grows                                 the number of constraints on designs                                 like that are going to become more and                                 more complex                                 and so managing stuff that's more                                  complex with even more humans                                  yeah well definitely an interesting area                                  i guess                                  one thing that i'm sort of wondering as                                  you say sort of this async problem                                  and and sort of going in that direction                                  uh i know that we have sort of a number                                  of sort of features in the language                                  pipeline                                  but there's also this aspect of sort of                                  rust community at large                                  and sort of how we're thinking about                                  sort of conferences and                                  all of these people who are forming                                  meetups and and so forth i'm wondering                                  actually if you want to talk about                                  uh sort of how we're thinking the                                  foundation is going to                                  interact with you know a community                                  that's literally                                  and probably at this point every country                                  in the world you know                                  thinking about rust or even meeting and                                  and so forth                                  my first thought was is antarctica a                                  country um                                  anyways if someone has brought russ to                                  antarctica please                                  tweet at me um but uh                                  yeah so i think something that's really                                  exciting about rust                                  is like as as a project                                  kind of without its own legal entity it                                  it has already built out the                                  functionality that                                  is is often kind of like the first task                                  of like a                                  early open source software foundation so                                  um i i think this kind of comes from the                                  fact that                                  from early on i don't know the origin of                                  this maybe nico you do but                                  there's always been this thought that                                  like we treat rust like a product                                  and so unlike maybe other                                  groups of engineers like marketing was                                  less of a bad term for us and it's                                  something that we kind of actively                                  leaned into and i think those kind of                                  early attitudes helped                                  shape uh like i would just i'd say like                                  a really                                  mature particularly events ecosystem                                  that like i guess the foundation                                  could events but                                  we really don't need that i mean i russ                                  fest just announced                                  um it's its own organization to help                                  incubate and run events um i                                  i won't summarize that more because i                                  don't want to get it wrong but uh                                  check out check out the new russ fest                                  initiative that they're doing                                  but we we've seen so so many independent                                  conferences pop                                  up and i mean even some of the meetups                                  that we have that call themselves                                  meetups like probably shouldn't because                                  they're on the scale of like more than                                                                                                       these are basically mini conferences                                  that people are calling meetups                                  um and i think                                  i think trying to make a foundation the                                  the center of everything that owns                                  everything                                  would be really a mistake uh the                                  foundation                                  at least the way i would hope to see it                                  would be                                  a player in the community right like                                  there's a large ecosystem of rust and                                  like the foundation is                                  is but a part and so                                  when i look to how how the the                                  foundation might                                  might support a community like i i i'm                                  recalling                                  i i don't know if it was an all hands or                                  an impul days but yeah i remember being                                  in                                  in the mozilla office in paris uh and                                  folks from the event team were running                                  kind of like a teach the teachers event                                  except it was for event organizers and i                                  i think things like that are really                                  critical i know as a teacher myself like                                  teach the teacher events                                  are are such you know force multipliers                                  and so i think                                  instead of necessarily seeing the                                  foundation spin up its own events                                  potentially                                  um i i definitely see it doing more of                                  the facilitation like                                  treating our community members like the                                  maintainers they are                                  and helping facilitate their ability to                                  to do the knowledge sharing that they've                                  been doing over the past couple of years                                  yeah so to follow up on that i know                                  we've sort of talked a little bit about                                  this                                  um before but one of the things that                                  we've sort of been thinking about                                  especially this year i know um we didn't                                  manage to run a                                  all hands and and sort of there's lots                                  of reasons for that and                                  in some sense it was actually good                                  because you know it was scheduled for                                  when the pandemic was already sort of in                                  in high flight                                  so that would have been complicated but                                  a lot between                                  december and march                                  a lot a lot of things yes                                  [Laughter]                                  uh but one of the things that sort of                                  i'm wondering is how is the foundation                                  going to you know help                                  uh guide us as maintainers to sort of                                  also have our own events maybe or                                  sort of interact better at sort of maybe                                  community run events                                  uh like what's the story there                                  oh i i'm kind of excited about this                                  i have to say because one of the things                                  that came out from the all hands the                                  fact                                  when it didn't happen was disappointing                                  but it was also                                  a moment where we we spent a little time                                  thinking about like                                  you know next year we should think about                                  what the all hands                                  like ought to look like actually uh                                  because as uh you know as ashley was                                  saying like rust has been growing and                                  growing                                  and it's not clear whether the all hands                                  as it was is exactly the right structure                                  as we get larger and larger maybe we                                  want to have more targeted ones maybe we                                  want to                                  do different formats um no no i'm                                  excited to see us                                  experiment here a little bit and try                                  different things i think it's really                                  critical                                  that we introduce                                  let's say more in high bandwidth sync                                  modes of interaction for the teams                                  um and i don't know at what point                                  like whether that's going to be flying                                  to the same place or you know i don't                                  know that                                  there's a lot of question marks but i'm                                  really excited about doing that                                  um but i think we should look and                                  experiment with exactly what that                                  actually means it may not be all hands                                  that's being good maybe something better                                  ashley so nico touched a little bit on                                  the sort of all hands itself                                  but what are you thinking about sort of                                  sending people to                                  conferences in the world like                                  maintainers you know giving talks or                                  other ways of interacting with the                                  community like is that in scope                                  is is it out of scope                                  um so i want to avoid being too                                  prescriptive because                                  we're going to have a board full of                                  i i don't know who they all will be yet                                  but some of the people that i think                                  might be like are really awesome humans                                  who i                                  think have some really great ideas uh                                  but like when i think about if                                  if i got to decide what the board did in                                  some                                  magical world where that might happen                                  like when i was evaluating a proposal                                  like i would just continue to ask myself                                  the question like                                  how does this help maintainers do their                                  job better                                  um and so                                  i i definitely think something that                                  could would definitely help maintainers                                  is like                                  being able to help support them                                  particularly like                                  i think that the high bandwidth like                                  high sync communication                                  as someone who has probably been like i                                  like working remote forever                                  uh it's so critical and i think                                  especially over this year                                  like we we've really felt felt that pain                                  of just like                                  missing that like social touch from                                  folks and the                                  these teams are are solving really high                                  problems                                  uh hard problems and i think it's                                  important that that folks have like a                                  social connection                                  um so i i could imagine that                                  those things would be in scope like                                  really just if you ask yourself like                                  does this help                                  maintainers get their their work done um                                  that would be that's at least the first                                  bar in my mind                                  yeah i think i'm thinking about how                                  i don't know i think something like i                                  think we've talked about doing things                                  like supporting                                  maybe helping conferences to organize                                  adjacent events and things like that                                  that might be an interesting way to go i                                  don't                                  i i when we've done that i think it's                                  always been really great                                  um so it's something i mean i think                                  that's partially because whenever                                  anyone's at a rest conference they're                                  like why isn't this a whole week we just                                  want to hang out forever                                  um which is true and i agree with that                                  um so that's that's always                                  nice i was just thinking about a lot of                                  the                                  great people in the community that i                                  first met at those kind of events so                                  they're definitely a great place to like                                  bring people in and get them you know i                                  think                                  can i say that we were talking earlier                                  about that conversion up the ladder and                                  so forth and                                  i think what sometimes that is it is                                  easier                                  to help pull someone along when you have                                  just just some face time                                  to get to know them better and like pay                                  them concentrated attention                                  so if we can do more to enable that i                                  think it'll be really helpful                                  yeah i i mean i would love more sync                                  time with                                  all of core at least i know that much um                                  and you know everybody on the rest                                  project is really great to spend time

maintainers uh being                                  empowered to do you know better work or                                  sort of more work in some sense and more

                              and a lot less of the work                                  that no one wants to do you're                                  empowering

sort                                  of                                  if i'm an average rest user maybe i've                                  never contributed a patch                                  um sort of what kind of help are we                                  looking for what are we looking for from                                  uh people in you know this week and in                                  the coming weeks                                  what should they do you know if they                                  want to help out or if they want to give                                  feedback or                                  ask questions where should they go like                                  help with the foundation effort you're                                  saying sure                                  or just help in general i mean i think                                  you're helping the foundation effort                                  like the the thing that                                  there's there's honestly it's not                                  something where we need like                                             volunteering but we do need                                  what is really helpful is kind of people                                  interacting giving us                                  raising questions on the repo and                                  helping us kind of                                  figure out what's on people's minds so                                  that we understand it best and we can                                  explain it better                                  but for helping with the rust project                                  that's a much bigger question                                  and there's a lot of things going on um                                  i don't know i won't just say ping me                                  although it's often always here                                  but are you sure that that's what                                  nico we we decided we're not talking                                  about github                                  [Laughter]                                  i notifications gonna say i think we                                  have                                                                    excited to hear how this is going to                                  work out for you nico                                  but                                  um yeah i mean i when i think about like                                  how how can folks help out with the                                  foundation                                  uh everybody who's been asking really                                  thoughtful questions on the github repo                                  um                                  i think that that's been really helpful                                  like uh                                  because of that we've been able to draft                                  an faq that i think is                                  has turned out much better than if we                                  had sat down to write it with like just                                  a blank page and we're like what do we                                  think people want to know                                  um so i know it sounds like extremely                                  cheesy probably but like                                  keep asking questions like it is                                  actually incredibly helpful                                  um and then yeah like                                  as far as it like helping with the                                  foundation long term goes like i don't i                                  don't think that we                                  we know yet really like what those                                  opportunities might be                                  but what i would expect is that like the                                  foundation is                                  is going to be working on initiatives                                  that are going to be with the project                                  and so just participating in rust                                  and having a desire to make rust better                                  and                                  wanting to show up and invest time like                                  i think that's probably the best way to                                  help like at the end of the day                                  helping the foundation is fine but we're                                  all showing up because we want to build                                  an awesome rust and like that's that's                                  really the                                  i think the best way to get involved                                  also the sun is setting over here can                                  you tell i'm like                                  losing i should have turned lights on                                  before this broadcast                                  can you tell this is the first broadcast                                  we're doing                                  i don't know that i think i like the                                  sunset so you can                                  just stay like that it's fine okay you                                  would prefer if i just went into the                                  shadows and let it just be the sunset                                  right yeah i mean there's like random                                  construction cranes and such too so you                                  know                                  it's a mixed background yeah i have a                                  physical instantiation of crane lifts                                  just like right outside my window that's                                  what's going on there                                  um that's how committed i am no                                  i think this this last point that ashley                                  was raising is really good right and                                  it's                                  like that that we want to have                                  uh kind of the foundation and the                                  project working together                                  and it's not like there are two separate                                  entities um                                  each going their own way so you but you                                  maybe become a contributor to the                                  foundation or something it's like                                  they're working on shared goals like the                                  when the project                                  and so when you want to get involved in                                  rust you come to the ross project and                                  see what's going on                                  and that may you probably won't even                                  know                                  but you're probably interacting with                                  some resources that the foundation has                                  helped to arrange here or there                                  you know but um that's not the way that                                  like i                                  i'm gonna say ideally it shouldn't be it                                  should be supporting                                  right i don't know how visible exactly                                  we'll see                                  but uh that's the way we should think                                  about it                                  i agree                                  well i guess we have eight minutes left                                  we decided not to solicit questions but                                  now i'm kind of like man that would have                                  been maybe interesting                                  yeah i'm i'm still scared of following                                  multiple live chats it's it's                                  complex yeah                                  that that is very true um                                  yeah i don't want us to have necessarily                                  any dead air                                  uh i can ask you mark being rmc                                  uh what are you most excited about for                                  the foundation                                  like personally personally                                  i think honestly with my like infra hat                                  on                                  i think the most exciting thing for me                                  is for people to like actually give us a                                  budget                                  and like hold us to it i know that                                  sounds probably very weird                                  and like it seems weird that like we                                  want limits                                  but i know that a lot of my work has                                  been sort of                                  designing various systems around rust                                  and like especially as we work on like                                  the perf collector                                  um and sort of we need this dedicated                                  hardware being able to sort of figure                                  out like                                  how do we get it and who do we go to to                                  even ask for                                  you know budget or grants or whatever um                                  has has been really difficult um and                                  sort of as a                                  another part of that being able to do                                  things like run surveys more often to                                  sort of figure out like what is actually                                  the thing that users want                                  we run a yearly survey and that's like                                  really amazing data but it is you know                                  once a year                                  um and has steadily been growing for                                  from like maybe                                                      beginning now i think we have probably                                  uh hundreds of questions just across                                  like multiple different instantiations                                  um so not everybody sees every question                                  but it's a lot                                  yeah material is really important that                                  we don't translate the survey into a                                  dog so whoever's who is in charge of                                  that                                  i uh i i'm actually really excited about                                  this kind of                                  data collection resources i think                                  there's one thing i                                  i know on the survey interesting                                  feedback                                  was like basically someone saying that                                  we should uh                                  doing one big survey is really great i'm                                  glad we do it but we should also                                  consider                                  doing more like targeted surveys and i                                  think that is an interesting thing to                                  pursue                                  um for one thing as well as data to                                  crunch but you know just to look like                                  i'd like to follow up on the survey and                                  say oh this was an interesting data                                  point                                  can we what can we do to understand                                  better like why people gave that thing                                    out of                                                  um and that's a that's a really                                  interesting thing and                                  i don't know uh it's been hard to                                  follow up on those kind of ideas i think                                  we'll have more room for that                                  um one thing i do wonder about i don't                                  know if you've ever talked about this                                  but i'm curious                                  is also like studies because we're going                                  off                                  we got the last five minutes we might as                                  well go off script                                  we did not have a script i know                                  we've been on script the whole time                                  people uh user studies                                  like i'm interested in what                                  more we can do to to see                                  sort of people using the language and                                  get                                  kind of a better understanding of the                                  pitfalls and things that they encounter                                  or like what kind of error messages are                                  most confounding                                  um which my dream that would be we would                                  be able to be                                  to see like the                                  i don't know to get more insight into                                  that and just see uh this message seems                                  to always lead people down a                                  a a bad bad chain let's see if we can                                  improve it                                  um that's nice i'm glad to hear you say                                  that                                  i feel like i've been like oh my gosh                                  the data opportunities                                  like today and you're like okay ashley                                  it's interesting i think these are both                                  all these things we're talking about are                                  like                                  now this is exactly that's what we were                                  saying the project and the foundation                                  not being like fully independent but                                  working together                                  they're both going to take work on both                                  sides right                                  so the maintainers designing and                                  thinking about what kind of information                                  they need and the foundation helping to                                  coordinate those resources and store                                  that data in a sensible way with                                  sensible privacy policies or whatever                                  else we need                                  [Music]                                  yeah i know at least i don't know                                  sometimes i think a lot about                                  the work set in front of all of the rust                                  teams and that like                                  i'm i'm excited for the for the                                  foundation because i think the                                  foundation works on like a slightly                                  different                                  time scale than the teams does and that                                  it                                  it's it's well designed to have the time                                  and space to like                                  actually look at like i i really want to                                  dig                                  into like the github api and like you're                                  talking about user studies which i think                                  would be awesome but                                  classically i'm like what's the                                  maintainer like                                  experience like what are the the                                  kinds of things i when i was running                                  some data                                  for for a presentation i had to do                                  gosh i wish i could remember where's pho                                  anyways um we were like trying to figure                                  out how many                                  individual like unique github accounts                                  had                                  had participated on an rfc                                  um it was a big number uh and i think                                  that that's really interesting and i                                  think there's like                                  i don't know probably a lot of like neat                                  research opportunities to like take a                                  look at that data and see                                  like where we could be doing                                  more interesting interventions to make                                  make things easier                                  um but yeah i don't know there's a lot                                  of cool stuff we're doing and                                  the opportunities to get meta about it i                                  think are great                                  yeah that's definitely true so i guess                                  we have like two minutes left so i don't                                  want to close this out too abruptly                                  um but i guess one thing ashley can you                                  actually put up the blog post link                                  so that we can point people at the next                                  session uh                                  times and and so forth uh because i                                  think one of the things that probably                                  a lot of our viewers are thinking is                                  like                                  how can i ask a question you know you've                                  talked about all these things and                                  maybe you have follow-ups or you know                                  want to talk to us about                                  one of these things in more detail and                                  as we've said um                                  it's actually like really interesting                                  we've had these really long zoom calls                                  uh which are both sort of tiring but                                  also um                                  actually really exciting to you know dig                                  into these details and                                  talk to each other and i know at least                                  i've really                                  enjoyed them even if it does mean waking                                  up at like                                  very
