Title: "Rust's Recipes for Code and Community" - E. Dunham (PyCon AU 2019)
Publication date: 2019-08-02
Playlist: Other Conferences 2019
Description: 
	E. Dunham

In some ways, a browser engine seems to have little in common with a web
framework. But both are ambitious software projects, approached by large
groups of diverse people trying and sometimes failing to cooperate,
collaborate, and code together. This talk shares firsthand observations,
collected over 3 years of working within the Rust and Servo teams at Mozilla
as well as volunteering on the Rust Community Team, about what all developers
can learn from Rust's approaches to the universal challenges of code and
community.
