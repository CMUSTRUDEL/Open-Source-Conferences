hi everyone I'm Bridget I am super new

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,580
and part of Academy I'm six weeks in so

00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:16,980
before six weeks ago I couldn't really

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,500
tell you much about coding let alone

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,960
what it was so we were invited to this

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,109
conference thankfully by Carol and Jake

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,660
thank you so much and as I was here and

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,509
you know just learning to code which is

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,309
out of nowhere super super tough right

00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:34,739
at least it was for me and we first

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,230
learned C sharp which did not make any

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,210
sense to me at all we learned it in two

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,839
weeks which also didn't make any sense

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,780
to me um so when we got to Ruby which

00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:47,549
was week three for us it was like such a

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,369
sigh of relief for me because it

00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,470
actually made sense and in our class we

00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,420
developed some people who like love C

00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,489
sharp and would yell at ruby and say why

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,409
Ruby why aren't you c sharp and i was

00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,820
one of those people who would say why

00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:03,150
would you do c sharp when you could do

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,150
Ruby so there became sort of this

00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,710
language versus language but we went

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,780
back to c-sharp actually in the past

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,490
week and through doing Ruby c-sharp

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,649
makes a lot more sense to me now so I

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,329
have come to respect it John will be

00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:19,710
shocked to hear um so um at the start of

00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:22,170
the conference yesterday I went to the

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,460
intro to rust which was taught by Ben I

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,740
believe um and he was over that and he

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,179
was explaining basically how rest is

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,960
different from other languages going

00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:36,479
really quickly through it and with that

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,049
talking about Ruby he would say

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,119
something like to the effect of you know

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,460
in Ruby this is much different because

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,740
like Ruby doesn't care in class John

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,749
often said to us Ruby don't give a

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,520
expletive uh so um I I sort of noticed

00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:57,090
and I actually chatted gene about this I

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,310
noticed that at least my perception was

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,369
that there is a hierarchy among

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,979
languages and being so new and loving

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,820
Ruby which I was learning was perhaps

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:11,950
the simpler of the line

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:14,230
if we want to attribute value to it I I

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,850
felt a little bit less than but I wasn't

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,940
sure if this was stuff i was making up

00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:20,830
in my head which i have been known to do

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,660
so i chatted gene and I said hey I've

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,640
noticed this and when been said in class

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,870
and he was talking about you know Ruby

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,780
does this differently there was this

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,090
giggle and that giggle was with such a

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,880
an indicator to me that there was this

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,040
this hierarchy or as I understood it

00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,530
there was a hierarchy so I asked her

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,560
about it and it facilitated this sort of

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,620
deeper discussion of know each language

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,020
does different things really really well

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,000
but really there is no like known

00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,550
hierarchy like c-sharp isn't ranked

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,250
number one Ruby isn't ranked dead last

00:02:51,550 --> 00:03:00,160
rust isn't like going to save us all so

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,190
I asked her about this and she she

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,350
suggested that I bring it up today

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:09,190
simply because I think that just like

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,290
our class there tends to be people who

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,900
gravitate towards one or the other and

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,310
then start to in the word through

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,640
discussing this with a bunch of people

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,890
here you know in the past 48 hours the

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,079
word tribal kind of came up and

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,739
everybody feels only chance to their

00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:33,549
specific tribe whether that be C sharp

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:37,870
rust or Ruby my real question and my

00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:40,500
real reason to be here is is why like

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,630
what does that do for us as programmers

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,540
and does it ultimately hurt us more than

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,000
it helps us that's really all I have for

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,579
you I don't have the answers in any way

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,620
shape or form as I said I'm six weeks in

00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,290
so you guys have far more answers than I

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,510
do just a bit of background about me of

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,430
why I find this so interesting my

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,200
bachelor degree is in anthropology and

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,959
sociology so this should come as no

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,510
shock to you that and i specialized in

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:12,170
gender and linguistics too so with that

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,010
noticing sort of at

00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:17,419
patience to language and just taking

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,220
meaning through those languages is

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:21,530
something that I kind of do

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,500
subconsciously so I just wanted to throw

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:27,970
it back at you guys and let you think

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,970
about it Mull it over

00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,980
