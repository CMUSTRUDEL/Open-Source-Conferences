	00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,590
so I was actually deliberately told

00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:13,190
several times today I would not be

00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:16,189
giving a lightning talk so so this is

00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:19,669
towed this is really lightning talk this

00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:23,600
is maybe like a thunder talk since I did

00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:26,180
absolutely no preparation so the title

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,369
of the talk is beyond the up arrow so

00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,990
what I see is a lot of people there you

00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:31,490
know working at the command line they

00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,100
want to do something they've done before

00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:36,290
and so a barrow oppo oppo a book for

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,180
what they were doing before but it turns

00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,680
out their act and I apologize you can

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,739
see so my other stuff here I'm going to

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,260
bother getting rid of it nothing secret

00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:46,699
what people may not know there's a lot

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,739
there a lot better ways there's actually

00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:51,500
a whole variety of ways of dealing with

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,210
your command line history so first

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,220
you'll see I actually have a number next

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,530
to my prompt again this is totally you

00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,879
know uh from scratch I otherwise would

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,930
have started at one but we're starting

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,000
at 15,000 397 so one thing you can do is

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,820
if you do the history command it'll tell

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,190
you you know what what did you type you

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,510
know recently so you can see my

00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:16,220
following along yesterday and so again

00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,280
normally what someone might do if they

00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:24,050
wanted to like say rerun a cargo bill to

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,730
go up up up there we go but I can see

00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:31,040
here from running history while that was

00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:36,740
a command 15 391 so I do bang ! 15 391

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,450
and boom I'm in the wrong directory but

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,780
I was able to run it again yah deacon

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,940
you can tell this is like you know very

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,920
unscripted so but you can see I can run

00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,140
that command just by using bang and then

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,960
the number of that command there are

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,360
actually a lot of other sort of bang

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,770
abbreviations that you can use so let's

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,550
start I'm going to do see if there's a

00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,740
file in this directory let me go into a

00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:04,610
directory that has a file here we go

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,310
Kark I want to look at cargo tamil so

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:10,200
cat cargo tamil and then I think oh I

00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,870
want to cat that out again okay cuz acts

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,239
you know uh whatever i'm gonna do this

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,900
command again so you could just do up

00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,580
arrow enter you also can do bang bang

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,470
which does the last command you think

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,790
well that actually does not save me a

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,890
keystroke lagoon why would i do that but

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,900
it actually becomes a more interest more

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,340
interesting you can add things on fits

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,140
almost like its own little programming

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,940
language so let's say you want to see

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,799
what the last thing you type was you

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,410
don't want to actually execute it so you

00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:42,810
can do bang bang colon P which just

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,819
prints out what you did so this can also

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,360
be calm if you want to see something you

00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:51,690
did like a while ago like back 13 951 I

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,120
want to look what was that is that a

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,799
typo there but I replaced be with B

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,590
equals short B plus a for that command

00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:04,680
so with these bangs you can also not

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,970
just do absolute references like that

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,340
you can say all right what did I do

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:14,430
three commands ago bang minus three or

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:17,579
what did I do ten commands ago bang i

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:21,500
pinged google apparently oh it's always

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:26,250
amazing what do i do in my spare time um

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,410
realis I know you're all excited so we

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,720
can also look at things a little bit

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:35,519
more granularly if we want to access

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,250
specific elements of a command that we

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,030
typed in so before i had cat cargo tamil

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,739
right but let's say i want to edit it so

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:49,200
emacs dash and w give me the last

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:51,989
argument from the last command bang

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,090
dollar so this is going to open up well

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:57,239
actually a first can give me a little

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,380
emacs error and then it emacs is the

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,420
latter edits the last the last argument

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,970
of the last command you can actually get

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,739
more into detail let's say instead of

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,280
just bang dollar let's say I'm catting a

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:15,650
bunch of files so cargo tamil cargo lock

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:19,620
okay and I'm like oh I just want to edit

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,390
the the one remember so there's ear the

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,389
first argument is 0 the second is one

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,870
that the

00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:28,960
third is to etc so bang colon one will

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,520
edit the second element of that okay so

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,039
on you can actually combine these two

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:38,560
like let's say I want to edit Emacs thus

00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,330
two commands back the last argument from

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,699
it and I actually don't want to do this

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,699
command I just want to print it out so

00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:47,409
Emacs banging minus two dollar p so it's

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,969
just I would have edited cargo dot lock

00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,080
so there's a whole bunch of these bank

00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:52,029
commands that are actually really useful

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,490
for constructing your history and one

00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:56,379
last thing I wanted to talk about and

00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:00,460
for I know someone said like everyone on

00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:01,599
rust does Emacs soon I was just the core

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,779
team I assume that applies to everyone

00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:09,599
here hey uh I said you could actually

00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:09,599
what's that I don't know about that

00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,889
control our does a reverse search so you

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,839
can just from the command line search i

00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,240
went and it will interactively ser was

00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,819
last time i used cat and then i say

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,129
enter and selected so you can actually

00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:26,139
do that reverse search so we have the

00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:26,990
bang commands history to see the number

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:32,480
and reverse search

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,480
