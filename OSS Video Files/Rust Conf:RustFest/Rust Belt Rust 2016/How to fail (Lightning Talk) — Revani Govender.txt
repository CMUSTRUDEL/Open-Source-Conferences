hi everyone so how appropriate that my

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:17,130
talk on how to fail is number zero on

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,110
the schedule so yeah that's fun so it

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,449
may seem pretty obvious to a lot of

00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,520
people that making mistakes in your code

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,040
or having bugs in your code is common

00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,840
and you shouldn't be afraid of them but

00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:33,719
I'm a chemist by training originally and

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,480
making mistakes in the food industry or

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,640
making mistakes in pharmaceuticals can

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,670
cost a company Millions you can cause

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,290
lawsuits and not to mention every time

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,739
you make a mistake even if it's just

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,290
spelling you have to sign and date and

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,540
then have your manager sign and date and

00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:55,200
if you mess up the date yes you have to

00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:57,000
cross that out sign and date that too so

00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,840
I'm not going to say it was traumatizing

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,690
but it was a little bit traumatizing so

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,079
when I started coding I did most of my

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,479
learning by myself online as I'm sure a

00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,700
lot of you have done most of your

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,679
learning by yourself but missing out on

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,219
a lot of conversations I didn't realize

00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:18,869
that it was okay to make mistakes so one

00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:22,289
of the biggest things that I had to

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,619
learn as a developer was how to make

00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:27,929
mistakes that is really scary because

00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:29,249
one drop in chemistry can be the

00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:31,679
difference between seeing a clear

00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:34,679
solution or seeing something bright pink

00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:37,079
or blue or black and you have to be

00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:39,420
precise within one one-hundredth or one

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,189
one-thousandth at the minimum sometimes

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:47,340
so learning how to make mistakes that

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,759
was an interesting experience when I

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,669
started in the industry I think I made

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,590
my manager pretty frustrated because I

00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:57,630
would rather show him nothing than to

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,659
show him something that what I

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,349
considered wrong or a misunderstanding I

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,060
didn't realize reading forms and such

00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,700
learning on my own that making mistakes

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,700
was okay because often you see comments

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,740
on that say things like well why would

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,570
you make that simple error or it's

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,610
really simple you should do this and

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,670
that kind of discourages somebody like

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,890
me who

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,450
is so afraid to make mistakes and so

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,810
afraid of failing because it could take

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,430
months to correct that mistake it makes

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,130
someone like me really scared to ask

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:34,209
questions because maybe nobody else in

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,850
the room has had that problem what I

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:40,390
learned from taking a workshop this past

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,819
weekend was everybody in the room was

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,950
afraid like had the same mistake but

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,930
everybody in the room was also afraid to

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,489
say that they had received a certain

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,560
error when they tried to run their

00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,650
program and once somebody was brave

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,720
enough to say hey something's wrong here

00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:00,190
and then five other people in the room

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,920
said oh yeah I have that error to my

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,890
main point here is that we need to

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,340
realize and we need to be more welcoming

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,799
to questions and when you're teaching

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,630
somebody how to code maybe the fact that

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,549
they have nothing on their screen maybe

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,489
if you press undo a little bit you would

00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:20,319
see that they had maybe lines and lines

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,750
of code that may be on the right track

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:29,350
they just may have some compiler error

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:32,829
somewhere around along that line I think

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:35,200
that when you are learning learn how to

00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:37,480
test your code and ask questions on how

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,480
to test and learning how to set up test

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,459
environments that was extremely helpful

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,530
I'm still learning how to fail and how

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,470
to fail correctly and how to learn from

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:50,620
my mistakes and I hope that people also

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,500
liked follow that journey and learn how

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,830
to fail correctly thank you

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,830
