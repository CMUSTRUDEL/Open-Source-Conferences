Systems programming often seems scary. To start with, you need to know C. Debugging obscure pointer issues is hard, and nobody will tell you if you're passing the wrong type of flag to a function. I've been doing a bunch of systems programming in Rust recently, and I've found it a lot easier, more accessible, and more fun.
