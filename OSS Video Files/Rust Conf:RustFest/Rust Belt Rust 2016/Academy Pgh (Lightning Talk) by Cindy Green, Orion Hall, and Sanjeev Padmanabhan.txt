so some of you may have noticed that

00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:13,219
there's a clump of people that tend to

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,660
stick together they look a little bit

00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,500
different from the majority of the other

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,359
folks here in that they are super

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,710
confused sort of glossy expressions on

00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,880
your face we're just going to talk to

00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,160
you a little bit about what's our

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,550
experience with starting to learn to

00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,680
code and to develop and we're going to

00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,910
start off with Orion talking about why

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:37,819
we began this journey in the first place

00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:40,789
yeah so I went to school for a

00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:43,729
humanities field basically I was

00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:45,229
studying linguistics but when I got out

00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:48,199
of that I realized there's not much

00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:51,469
application you can basically get into

00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,989
academia or become you know work in an

00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:57,549
office job or something so one day when

00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:00,109
I was working at my job at t-mobile I

00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:01,999
talked to one of my customers and he was

00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:04,580
talking about his job working in

00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:07,250
programming and I talked to him about it

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:11,000
and I realized that it's actually much

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,110
more accessible than it seems and I

00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,630
think there's a perception on the

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,010
outside in the outside world that it's

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,050
something you can only do if you've

00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:21,440
always been really amazing at math and

00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,780
science but it's very accessible and

00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,960
there's so many applications that if

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,520
you're a creative person or whatever

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,690
whatever your interest in you're going

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,450
to be able to find something that you

00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,060
can do with it on top of that I also

00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,950
think it's amazing because the future is

00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,690
just going to be more and more about

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,670
computer science so if you get into it

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,830
now you're doing yourself a really good

00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,930
service for the future so I think that's

00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,420
why we're all pretty excited about it

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,850
and I want to talk to you a little bit

00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,760
about how why I chose a boot camp which

00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:55,520
reflects some other people as you may

00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,170
know there is no one path to learn there

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,050
was no one language to learn there is no

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,460
one way to learn and if you are thinking

00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,800
about learning to become a developer

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,770
it's very difficult to know where even

00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,039
to begin and some of us struggled online

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:13,129
alone for a while we ended up choosing

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,520
to apply to Academy Pittsburgh which is

00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:20,290
brand new we are in the second session

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:24,190
it is run by john lang and josh lucas it

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,680
is free we are learning so much we've

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,950
learned C sharp and Ruby and testing and

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,600
databases and so far it's going really

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,340
well we're located in the Allentown

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,770
neighborhood of Pittsburgh and we are

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:42,010
the second session there are 17 of us so

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:43,840
far and we're really enjoying it alright

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:48,910
my name's on ji forever d Kozma chief

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,560
and so I came from like a more business

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,380
analyst like testing and analysis

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,060
background I've always had my eye

00:02:53,380 --> 00:03:00,250
towards more of a hands-on development

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,100
type of feature or career so when I

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:07,150
heard about Academy ficksburg I jumped

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,920
on the chance and I think though as we

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,270
all face different challenges some of

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,180
the video one of the biggest challenges

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,480
is sort of problem solving that you're

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,220
getting your head around the problem and

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,680
at least for us we are getting so many

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,959
different languages and technologies

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,290
thrown at us sometimes it takes a while

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,200
to figure out what pieces fit we're in

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,450
the puzzle and you know maybe what's

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,360
right to use for one situation what's

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,010
right to use for another and but I

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,080
should get more complex and work on more

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,240
things that kind of hopefully that will

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,080
start to make sense but right now we're

00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,150
just we're just kind of trying I see

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,500
where things going now if we be able to

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:53,200
put i'll put that all together so and

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,240
lastly we wanted to talk about are some

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,130
of our favorite things so far in that

00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,440
we've experienced and for me it would

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,060
definitely be the community there's been

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,000
so many people that we've talked to

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,970
whether online or in person the academy

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,860
or wherever that are extremely helpful

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,400
and

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,020
even if our experience level is very low

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,880
they're willing to guide us through

00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,709
things because everybody in this field

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,440
is really excited about this field so

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,750
they want other people to understand and

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,510
also it's great to see other people's

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,280
thought processes and how they think

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,470
about things because it helps you to

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,920
uncover new problems and new solutions

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,600
to what you're doing one thing I really

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,360
like about it and what I have heard from

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,710
most people I love to learn and this is

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,630
a great environment for people who love

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,250
to learn I know everybody here loves to

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,110
learn because you are working on rust

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,930
which is a brand new language which you

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,550
probably would not have to do so for a

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,169
lot of us who love to learn we love to

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,060
think and this is a great chance for us

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,320
to get into a career where we're know

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,880
we're going to be learning for the rest

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,290
of our lives and I just want to add that

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,400
one of the things I love about this

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:05,220
course is or just in general is learning

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,510
how different people come at a problem

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,040
from different directions because it

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,100
really helps you open your mind and

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,150
maybe figure out you know understand

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,830
something better when you hear other

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,690
people there are perks to it before we

00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,090
get kicked off stage we just wanted to

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,610
thank Jake and Carol for inviting us

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,140
here and also john laing josh lucas and

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,580
everyone else who's been involved with

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,500
Academy Pittsburgh if you could give

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:34,160
them a big round of applause

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,160
