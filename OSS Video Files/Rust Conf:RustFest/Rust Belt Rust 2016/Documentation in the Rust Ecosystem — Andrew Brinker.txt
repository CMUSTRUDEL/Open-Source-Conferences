Title: Documentation in the Rust Ecosystem — Andrew Brinker
Publication date: 2017-10-25
Playlist: Rust Belt Rust 2016
Description: 
	Materials for this talk are available at https://github.com/AndrewBrinker/talks/tree/master/rust-belt-rust-2016

Documentation is important. It lowers the barrier for newcomers to use and understand libraries. It helps train and prepare new contributors. It opens up avenues of contribution that go beyond writing code. It makes open source more open, and makes libraries better by its existence.

Rust has all the makings of a great ecosystem of well-documented libraries: a high-quality and ever-improving documentation generator ships with the compiler, and the language team leads by example with a strong focus on documentation. Yet the quality and availability of documentation for Rust crates remains spotty, with many crates providing incomplete documentation, or relying on the types they expose to describe their use and function. This talk takes an in-depth look at the state of documentation in the Rust ecosystem today—including how many crates provide easily-located documentation, and how complete that documentation is—and then describes ideas for improvement, including improvements to Rust's documentation-related tools and ideas for crate maintainers to both write better docs themselves and to encourage contributions from others via documentation-focused mentorship.

hello so as she said I am Andrew Brinker

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,250
and I'm here today to talk about

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,830
documentation in the rust ecosystem

00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,180
basically why do docks matter what kinds

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,380
of docks we need to consider like which

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,200
is what are the different sort of types

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,239
that are that should be available for a

00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,450
library how our docks in the rust

00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,560
ecosystem looking right now and how what

00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,919
can we do in each of our different

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,720
community roles to make the the

00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,340
documentation as good as it possibly can

00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,780
be

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,429
and I want to say actually just I'm very

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,340
happy that it seems to fit so nicely

00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,840
with the previous talk I think the idea

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,879
of the rust being a productive

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,199
documentation is definitely a part of

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,609
that and so that's nice so first things

00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:53,670
first I think it's important to

00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:54,960
understand what we mean by docks are

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,210
there different types of docks what are

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,489
the goals and characteristics of the

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,109
different types of documentation

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:03,989
basically what does the word docks

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,330
include and I'd like to sort of think of

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,190
them in in three categories we meet-cute

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,070
the black triangle the walkthrough and

00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,540
the reference and I think it's also

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,979
important to note that each of these

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:20,040
types of docks can can be present in in

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,219
different actual documents you may have

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,149
one document that has several of these

00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:27,060
this isn't talking about like a

00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:28,439
particular document you could have for

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,530
example a walkthrough and a reference

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,880
that are both using rust dock so this is

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,350
more about the concept of the

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,430
documentation itself rather than the

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,030
documents that are being used to

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,520
communicate it so the meet-cute is

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,070
answering the most basic questions about

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,950
your library it's what is this thing why

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,030
should I care like is this useful to me

00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,750
usually you'll see this at like the top

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,590
of a readme

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,079
it's your shortest pitch of why does

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,399
this thing exist right because if you if

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,200
you don't have that if you don't you

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,479
can't convince a person when they come

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,950
look at your library that this thing is

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,420
something that they need or if they

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,740
don't even know what you're doing and

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,899
have no idea what your library is no

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,000
one's going to use it and so this is

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,489
sort of the most basic piece of

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,870
documentation

00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:15,269
next you have the black triangle which

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,610
is the the simplest code to do something

00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,930
good so the the name the black triangle

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,090
actually comes from a story by a

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,950
developer at rampant games they were

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,620
developing a new game and had built up

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,299
this whole new asset pipeline and

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,129
graphics rendering system and there's a

00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:30,510
whole bunch of stuff and have been

00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,620
working for several months and hadn't

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,299
really had anything to show that thought

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,010
it was all sort of down in the weeds

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:36,840
work and they hadn't gotten anything to

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,329
go through the whole system and actually

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,159
display and finally they did it was a

00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:44,280
black triangle and everyone in the in

00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,900
the project who was working on that was

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,099
very very excited to see this this

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,150
little black triangle on the screen

00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,859
because they knew that it had gone

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,829
through all this other stuff they'd

00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:54,420
written in it it showed that what they'd

00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,220
already done and showed what they could

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,720
do now now they had all this stuff in

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,079
place they could actually go about

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,180
building the game and so I think yeah

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,010
you want sort of the same response from

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,379
your simplest example your simplest

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,109
thing that shows hey here's how this

00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,920
thing works at a most basic level here's

00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:16,139
what it enables you to do and so that's

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,269
really what the black triangle is it is

00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,220
the simplest code to do something to do

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:23,669
something cool sort of entice people to

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,540
explore more the walk through I would

00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,829
say is probably the hardest part this is

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,750
guiding people through the the design of

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:32,579
whatever it is you've made making sure

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,349
that they they understand it and that at

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,180
the end of it feel like they can go and

00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:37,769
actually build something so for rust

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,599
like AI think that the rust book would

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,160
be sort of an example of this that it's

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,019
and obviously it's a very large

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,699
walkthrough but its explaining all of

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,500
the different little ideas and rests the

00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,900
different parts of the language and at

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,310
the end of reading the rust book person

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,769
should generally feel capable of going

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,239
and making something with rust and so

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,780
you're looking at the the same sort of

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,010
idea for your individual library this is

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,340
this is difficult to write and I will

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,169
get into that and finally you have the

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,209
reference this is your API reference

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:08,099
this is the complete thing it says every

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,260
little component you've got how it works

00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,370
how the things interrelate

00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,629
and it's I think the most important

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,209
thing to remember here is that people

00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:17,639
can come at this documentation from all

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,780
sorts of different directions it's it's

00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,639
not like a walkthrough where it's very

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,949
sort of directed there's a single path

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,389
through the API documentation can come

00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,510
from anywhere and so the biggest thing

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,889
there is providing at any given point

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,990
context for the people who are reading

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:32,430
it making sure that they're you don't

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,169
you know jump into some spot and have no

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,139
idea of what's happening or if they do

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:40,020
that there's some clear way to find out

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:42,030
what they don't know when it comes to

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,680
documentation Doc's are often the first

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,639
thing people see before they actually

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,320
look at your code before they do

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,940
anything with your library people are

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,600
likely to to look at the readme look at

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,520
some examples having that that first

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,010
documentation be good is is really

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,229
important because frankly first

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,650
impressions are important documentation

00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:03,000
is how your library says hello and

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,830
making sure that that that hello making

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,840
sure that that first impression is good

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:11,400
is is very very important and most of

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,180
all good Doc's are really needed for

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,950
productivity with the library people

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,419
aren't going to be able to build things

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,430
do things with your code no one wants to

00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,620
actually go through all the code itself

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,030
to figure out what are you providing to

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,889
them how do the parts work together how

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,820
do you use it people want to have Doc's

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:32,490
so it's just it's important to actually

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,139
make sure you do that and to give a sort

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,820
of case study about this I'm gonna talk

00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,789
a little bit about the creation of the

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,590
rust frequently asked questions page now

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:42,440
how many people here knew that rust had

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,440
a frequently asked questions page ah

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,440
cool

00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:49,449
for those of you who don't know if you

00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:51,399
go to the rust website go to the

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,020
documentation page just the link at the

00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:55,239
top there's a on that page linked to the

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,259
frequently asked questions page right

00:05:55,239 --> 00:06:01,300
now it's got just under 120 questions

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,889
and answers' know how they recommend

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,659
people check that out and if you have

00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:09,129
any problems with it please let me know

00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:11,110
I'm happy to to work on it with you so

00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:13,449
the the process for the frequently asked

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,809
questions page was basically done in

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:18,099
three phases and I think that the this

00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,199
these three phases provide a good

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,809
template for working on documentation in

00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,669
other contexts so the first was

00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:27,339
community outreach about a year ago some

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:29,080
of you all made it may have seen posts

00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,089
on like the rust subreddit or the user

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,869
forum or lobster's record news wherever

00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:37,509
I may be on Twitter asking for feedback

00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:39,849
about common questions people have with

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:42,069
with rust if you remember that that

00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:44,349
those questions were going to eventually

00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:47,769
went into the frequently asked questions

00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:49,809
page in this particular case this

00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:50,979
process was a really nice fit because

00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,689
it's a frequently asked questions page

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,189
and so it's nice to just ask what are

00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:55,599
your questions and then there you go you

00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,379
have them you just need to organize them

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,199
and answer them

00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:00,669
so that's but but the idea of community

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,219
outreach the idea of reaching out to

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:04,539
your users or to potential users who

00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:06,759
maybe looked at the thing you've made

00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:09,519
and said no it's not for me reaching out

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,019
to them and finding out why they didn't

00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,119
use it or what they don't like about it

00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:15,459
what their questions are it's a really

00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:17,619
really valuable thing to get a sense of

00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:19,839
what you're missing

00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:21,459
and the first thing to know is to it's

00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,219
useful to reach as far as humanly

00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:26,469
possible so for this that's just meant

00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:28,719
posting sort of the solicitation for

00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:30,639
questions on as many places as we could

00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:33,279
think of I know the rust Twitter account

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,199
tweeted about it and got some people

00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,699
through that just making sure that

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,759
you're really not if you don't want to

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:42,099
miss people the more input you get it's

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,329
just it's always valuable you're never

00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:45,459
going to be like oh no I'm done I don't

00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:47,749
I don't want any more feedback on this

00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:49,189
it's you just you want as right as why

00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:52,819
to reach as many eyes as many people

00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:55,129
contributing as possible and next is to

00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,239
take all input seriously one of the

00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,709
things I found is like when you've

00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:00,199
worked on a thing you've built a thing

00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:02,419
you are often one of the worst judges of

00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,649
what's easy to understand or hard to

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:05,689
understand about it or like what people

00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,429
are gonna have issues with it's easy to

00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:09,349
forget what it's like to be someone

00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:12,949
who's completely new to something has no

00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:14,239
idea what's going on and it's easy to

00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,369
when people do give that feedback to

00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,779
kind of ignore it or discounted or say

00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:19,909
oh well I think they're overstating how

00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:21,619
hard this is or like you want to take

00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:23,389
your users and people are giving

00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:25,729
feedback you want to take them seriously

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,789
when I really listen to what they're

00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:30,139
telling you and you want to check for

00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:33,529
existing sources one of the nice things

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,120
about being a programmer is that we like

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,979
to ask our questions in the public we

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,750
put stuff on Stack Overflow and that

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,889
provides actually a really nice place

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,389
where you can go and say hey what are

00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:43,759
people asking what are people having

00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:46,160
trouble with and in this particular case

00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,310
the stuff we found on Stack Overflow was

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,839
pretty much the in line with what we

00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,970
were getting from the direct feedback

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,110
but it provided more confidence in ok we

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,730
need we're addressing the right stuff

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,600
and it did fill out a couple of things

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,430
that hadn't been caught in the sort of

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,490
survey so you know if you have

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,449
pre-existing materials that tell you

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,819
what things people are having issues

00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:08,720
with what questions people are having go

00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:10,040
look at them make sure that you're

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,370
actually answering the questions that

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,079
people have already shared so the next

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,110
part and this is really the the hardest

00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:20,180
part is the first draft it's just going

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:24,470
from a blank screen or a blank piece of

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,350
paper to something this part for me took

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,579
me about a month that was like just

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,850
working my free time took me about a

00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:35,509
month on about initially a hundred

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,500
questions and it's just tough because

00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,720
there's that you have this sort of

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,610
pressure to get it right the first time

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,949
this sort of you need to have all that

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,569
the perfect framing the perfect

00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:46,160
contextualization the best examples and

00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:47,420
explanations and you get sort of

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,370
paralyzed because you don't you don't

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,850
know how to how to just get that right

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,529
away

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,699
and so the first thing to really

00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:56,579
remember you don't need to know

00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:57,149
everything I didn't I wrote answers that

00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,999
were wrong

00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:02,459
I wrote answers that were incomplete

00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:04,949
weird answers that were just bad but I

00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:06,989
wrote answers and then people could come

00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:08,309
in and give feedback and say hey this is

00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:11,879
this is bad this is wrong this is

00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:14,369
whatever and so I ended up learning a

00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,589
lot I became I think a better Russ

00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:18,179
programmer from writing the frequently

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,439
asked questions page because people came

00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,639
in and told me when I've gotten

00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:23,039
something wrong or right you know didn't

00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,689
know something and just being able to

00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,019
say hey I don't know something but I'm

00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:29,039
gonna write anyway is is really

00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,699
important just cuz once you have a

00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:34,529
starting point it gets a lot easier and

00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:37,169
it's okay to write poorly we're human

00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:40,919
sometimes we just don't words good it

00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:42,239
just doesn't people you know you can't

00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,859
be expected to get all of the wording

00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:46,679
right have the perfect sentences that

00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:48,600
are crystal clear everything needs

00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,399
revision it is the very rare person who

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,600
doesn't need to edit something that

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,949
they've written so I think letting go of

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,779
this idea that you have to get it right

00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:59,100
the first time make sure all your

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,379
grammar is right and sort of free out of

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,249
it before you show it to anyone

00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:07,139
you don't need to do that really just

00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:09,660
because some Doc's are better than no

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,949
Doc's having a a starting point

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,099
something that can be critiqued and

00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:16,470
approved and worked with is so much

00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:19,619
better than having a blank screen or a

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,939
blank page it just just because I don't

00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:23,069
know about you but I find it's as an

00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:24,179
example a lot easier to critique the

00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:26,189
opinion of someone else than it is to

00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:28,649
come up with your own opinion and it's

00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:30,839
the same sort of idea it's when there's

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,039
something to to take a stance against or

00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,829
to take a stance in favor of like it

00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:37,709
becomes a lot easier than just sort of

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:39,599
inventing something from whole cloth and

00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:41,059
then you get to move on to the next

00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:43,619
stage which is the longest stage

00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:45,359
refinement or editing taking that

00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:48,059
terrible probably thing that you've

00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:50,369
written and making it not terrible so

00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:51,869
for me the initial stage took about two

00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:54,749
months the the refinement stage took

00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:57,899
about three months working it was a good

00:11:54,749 --> 00:12:00,479
part time so it wasn't a job first thing

00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,889
don't fear the Delete key it can be easy

00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:03,749
once you've spent a lot of time on

00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:06,679
something to feel really attached to it

00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:09,209
and not like what not want to give it up

00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:11,549
this is this is gonna make the end

00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:12,749
product worse if people are telling you

00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:14,879
that something isn't clear something

00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:16,829
doesn't work listen to them you need to

00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,479
you know it you can't be completely

00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:19,949
attached to the things you've written or

00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:24,010
like have some sort of sense of of

00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:25,960
self-worth tied up in these things

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,610
and I'll say it's easier said than done

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,020
it's easy when you've spent a lot of

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,000
time in something to get defensive when

00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,220
people come and critique it and letting

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,850
go with that is a really valuable thing

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,990
and next get outside opinions working on

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,090
the frequently asked questions page we

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,890
had a ton of people who came in and and

00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,940
gave really really thorough feedback it

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,130
was actually a pretty cool experience

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,510
because there was a fairly long document

00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,560
that was surprised at the number of

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,830
people that were willing to go through

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,300
like the whole thing multiple times and

00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,910
in critique stuff and participate in

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,500
like discussions about how things that

00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,850
wording could be improved and things

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,310
like people were really generous with

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,130
their time and attention and it's it's

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:07,060
good to recognize that and to value that

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:09,130
people are doing that and finally just

00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,690
to to listen and I'll keep sending this

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:14,950
but it can be difficult to really take

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,830
in the feedback people are giving you to

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,480
really consider it deeply and respect

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,190
that people are coming from different

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,870
perspectives and different circumstances

00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,240
than you so like I remember one of the

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,790
answers I'd use some wording or a

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,140
particular word that was apparently

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,940
difficult for people who for whom

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,680
English wasn't their first language and

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,940
this was obvious for something I've

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,240
never considered English as my first

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,200
language I don't speak anything else and

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,880
writing it was just like yes this seems

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,170
like the right word to use but then

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,690
people come up in a like what does this

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,740
mean what are you saying here and really

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,330
listening to them and saying okay well

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,090
how can we phrase this in a way that

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:53,290
will be clearer to a broader range of

00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:55,540
people is important so in the end it

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,760
took about four months four hundred and

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,000
sixteen comments forty-two commits and

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,550
twenty-nine participants and that was

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,560
all by the way just for the the first

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,390
first version it never been changes and

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,490
improvements since then we've added more

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,870
questions and more answers updated

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,020
answers there are some answers right now

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:16,570
that need need fixing I know there's an

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,480
answer on higher kind of types that is

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:22,120
not great and needs improvement that and

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,190
I there others just you know the things

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,990
I can always be improved you get more

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,670
feedback from people this is really a

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,890
ride getting good documentation is a

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,000
continuous process like it doesn't stop

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,470
when you publish to the thing and you're

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,730
like okay I'm

00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,589
you want to keep getting that feedback

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,870
you want to keep collaborating the

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,670
people when they come up with some new

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,500
way of phrasing some some new idea to

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,110
really incorporate that and make sure

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:49,430
that your documentation is the best that

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:51,500
it can possibly be good Doc's require

00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,180
empathy they require collaboration they

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,579
require time and they don't happen on

00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,860
accident and I think that this is just

00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:59,959
important to remember that your your

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,720
documentation isn't just gonna suddenly

00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,940
get what get good without some real

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,600
effort and attention and time given to

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:12,110
it it's it you really have to to want

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,070
good Doc's for them to happen so given

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,709
all this I want to talk a little bit

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,899
about where documentation is right now

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:20,300
in the the rust ecosystem

00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,899
so first the the rust ecosystem is is

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,140
quite big now

00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:25,310
as of Monday when I made this slide

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,220
there are six thousand six hundred and

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:32,029
thirty nine crates and 79 million seven

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,980
hundred and seventy 1988 downloads so

00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:37,070
this is awesome it's super cool to see

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,949
this many crates to see that a little

00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:42,680
over a year past 1.0 the the ecosystem

00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:45,110
keeps growing and for this basically

00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,449
looked at the the number of like how the

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,920
docks are for the top 100 crates we've

00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:50,959
done more but because this was a sort of

00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,089
a manual process there was only so many

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:57,170
crates I was willing to go and check the

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,820
docks for so looking at the top 100

00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,930
crates basically no docks provided means

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,519
that there's either no links to

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,140
documentation or that the link that's

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,660
given is broken um I think there was

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,760
only one broken link the other ones just

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,260
just weren't there poor quality means

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,540
that there there may be like a couple of

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,730
dot comments but it's for the most part

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,399
there's really not much almost

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,709
everything is undocumented fair quality

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,000
is maybe you've got like half of your

00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,890
stuff that's covered by dot comments but

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,380
there are large portions of the API that

00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,880
aren't documented and then good quality

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,829
is that everything's got documentation

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,870
and all of us by the way is looking just

00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:32,060
at the documentation that's linked from

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,170
crates do once again just like a time of

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,460
thing I couldn't go in and do like a

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:38,430
deep dive with all

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:41,040
100 of the top crates and you know what

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,680
this is this is pretty good we've got

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,690
roughly half of the the top 100 crates

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,690
that really have quality documentation

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,970
this is looking at crates like regex has

00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:53,399
really good documentation lazy static

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,100
byte order things that just are clear

00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,839
documentation says exactly what how to

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,290
use this thing what all the different

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,770
parts are how they work and that's it's

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:08,760
really exciting but there is room for

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,199
improvement not not just in the the API

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,050
Docs not just in the docs linked from

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,579
from crates of i/o but in the rest of

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,650
the sort of docs portfolio that was

00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,120
talking about earlier making sure that

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,510
the the readme is clear making sure that

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,100
there's some sort of walkthrough first

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,990
lots of the docs are incomplete like I

00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,150
said there are some of these poor

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,250
quality and quality docs that don't have

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:35,970
complete documentation coverage of their

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:38,700
API things that just could use some more

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,960
love and then you have Docs that that

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,050
don't explain enough maybe they they

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,840
have comments but they're sort of not

00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,679
not helpful the funny is one I've seen

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,059
and I don't have a particular example

00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,340
from the the Russ community but I've

00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:51,929
seen Doc's before that are just sort of

00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,580
circular like you have the name for

00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:58,580
something and then the documentation is

00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:00,750
just the name set again it's not helpful

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,160
and so it's just sort of that that sort

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,350
of stuff making sure that not only are

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,179
the docs is there but that they're good

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,200
that they're helpful that someone you

00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,080
know coming to your library for the

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,230
first time can actually use them to to

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,429
get up to speed but a good good news

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,490
everyone

00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:19,679
the foundation is already laid one thing

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,090
that I really appreciate in rust is one

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,490
of the things that I I personally love

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,370
about the Russ community is that people

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,510
actually care about documentation I have

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:30,420
seen other programming communities where

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,590
it's it seems to be less of a of a focus

00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,420
at least in like the sort of core

00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,240
language level and that can be really

00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,100
frustrating as a user but the the rust

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,780
team clearly I think cares about

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,360
documentation there's been all the work

00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,630
on the rust book and the new edition of

00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,900
the rust book all this

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:49,090
the API Doc's the the sort of recent

00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,700
formation of the rust Doc's team and

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,350
believe they had like a Doc's day sort

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,820
of focusing contributions on

00:18:53,350 --> 00:19:00,060
documentation it is nice to know that as

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,400
a community we seem to care about

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:06,880
documentation and Russ doc is is super

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,170
cool and getting better it is just

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,710
wonderfully nice to have something that

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,060
is sort of standard everyone uses comes

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,540
with the language integrates with

00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,950
everything nicely and it's just it's

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,940
it's a good tool I don't know about you

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,450
guys but I've been very happy in my

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,280
experiences using Russ doc and then I'm

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,740
happy to know that they're things now

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,140
like doc start RS exist where it's very

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,850
easy to get the the current

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,110
documentation for four different crates

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,000
and it would be

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,360
it's just it'll be nice to see this

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,180
system continue to improve as

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,060
improvements come to - Russ doc so at

00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,590
this point it's really a question of

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,930
focus and planning making sure that

00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,340
we're actually giving our attention to

00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,230
documentation that libraries are

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,690
deciding hey this is something we want

00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:56,020
to work on and then putting in the

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:58,630
resources to make that happen

00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,880
so question now is where do we go from

00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:04,480
here like what are the actual

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,800
substantive next steps to improve a

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,820
documentation from where it is right now

00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,880
and I think the answer is different

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,830
depending on your sort of role in the

00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,380
ecosystem so if you're a great developer

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,450
I think the first thing is to review

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,310
your current Doc's portfolio what do you

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,720
have what do you not have are there

00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:23,050
things that aren't covered or things

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,980
that are covered insufficiently and this

00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,630
is the sort of thing we're talking about

00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,890
the process earlier you want to reach

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,600
out to your users you want to find out

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:32,350
what do you not understand why do you

00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:34,420
not get what's unclear where where can

00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:39,340
we really get the most value out of

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:42,070
focusing our attention and next is to

00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,300
offer mentored Doc's issues so mentored

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,310
issues in general I think are a really

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,950
cool thing and a really nice way to get

00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,970
people into contributing to a library or

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,000
get people into just

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:53,230
standing your library more and I think

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,600
that offering mentored issues on

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,490
documentation where you can sort of pair

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,720
with with someone who knows the

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,070
internals but maybe doesn't want to

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,299
devote all of the time and resources to

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,580
actually writing it and so you get this

00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,230
nice sort of supportive relationship we

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,429
have someone that wants to to get into

00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,559
writing documentation with this thing it

00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:10,270
wants to get into the library and can

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,860
can get knowledge from the more skilled

00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,929
person who then doesn't have to devote

00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,820
quite as much time and attention into

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,860
writing the documentation himself and so

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,890
I think it's it's a really nice solution

00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,990
for everyone and then I also think

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,210
treating Docs contributors like code

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,679
contributors not discounting them I

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,260
think that it's easy when you're in like

00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:32,110
a technical field to discount or

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,610
undervalue non-technical work and to

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,559
assume that like the technical work is

00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,299
the most valuable work and if someone's

00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,620
doing something else it must be because

00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:40,659
they're like not good enough in on the

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,460
skill to do the technical work and

00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:45,220
that's like a judgment or a bad thing

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,900
I think it's important to recognize and

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,539
value any sort of contribution that

00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,909
people make to to the libraries and

00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:53,650
things that you're working on and so

00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:55,030
that can you know be as simple as making

00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,650
sure that people who are contributing to

00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,150
your documentation are getting

00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,350
recognized as contributors to the

00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,179
project like we maintain some sort of

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,620
contributors list making sure that

00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:05,980
people who are writing Doc's are are

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,360
ending up in there and then just sort of

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,030
the the way you interact with people who

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,110
run Docs making sure that it's that you

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,600
are treating them you know with with

00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:16,940
respect and group of professionalism

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,650
and then next can consider doing doc

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,420
days or doc sprints sort of a you know

00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,309
short little period where you really

00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,540
focus contribution to say hey everyone

00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:24,650
we're gonna we're gonna work on

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,840
documentation and then get people

00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,910
together to to make it happen

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,650
it's it's nice to think just because it

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,700
what do you have everyone focused on it

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,770
you can get a lot more done than when

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,590
everyone's sort of haphazardly coming at

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:39,530
it there can be I think a really

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:44,540
valuable way to do direct and focus the

00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:45,650
work now if you are a great user that

00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,480
there also a variety of things you can

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,710
do first report Doc's issues when you

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,760
have them it's really easy like when

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,380
you've come to a library and the

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,750
documentation is missing or something is

00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,610
not clear to just say okay well I'm I'm

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,010
not going to I'm just gonna leave I'm

00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,510
not gonna participate this anymore and

00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,440
that is certainly fine for the the crate

00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,840
user but then it creates this problem

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,950
where the the crate maintainer may not

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,330
you know they don't know that you look

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,160
at this thing and then left because of a

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,770
particular reason they don't hear about

00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,170
you know why did you leave and so it's

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,370
easy then for the maintainer to miss out

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:15,890
on important stuff that they're doing

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:19,309
wrong that's causing people to leave or

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,570
to not start and so I think just if

00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,730
there's a problem if you find something

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,150
that's unclear that's missing just say

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,800
so

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,450
just open up an issue and say hey I

00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,670
don't know that I'm gonna use this thing

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,740
but I found this particular issue and

00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,820
this is kind of a blocker for me I don't

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,370
really understand what's happening here

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,900
and then that that really helps the the

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,760
crate maintainer to understand whether

00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:41,630
deficiencies are and focus their work

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,390
better next to participate in Doc's

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,010
discussions so you don't even have to do

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,770
much it's just sort of showing up and

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,210
giving feedback whether it's feedback on

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,710
on the language that's been used so

00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,960
making sure that the wording is clear

00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,850
like the people who told me that my I

00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,320
used some wording that wasn't clear for

00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,700
people who didn't have English as a

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,200
first language that was really valuable

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,590
and that was stuff that I never would

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,640
have gotten on my own and so

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,370
participating in these discussions

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,400
providing the unique sort of perspective

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,750
from people with the wide variety of

00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,690
technical backgrounds and personal

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,590
backgrounds is really valuable and then

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,900
finally in this probably the most

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,090
obvious one contribute to the docs if

00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,929
something is unclear and you understand

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,149
it write an explanation

00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:26,700
and this is is a really valuable way and

00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:29,940
maybe look for some mentored issues yes

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,500
do that so I think there's a lot of

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,750
things that can be done to improve the

00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,309
Blair documentation is right now and

00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,429
then for for everyone

00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:40,980
let's make rust more welcoming and

00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:43,080
productive together so I'd actually

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:47,899
planned for a question period with the

00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,899
talk rather than after so questions

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,149
comments someone want to yell at me

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,060
sure

00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,550
yeah that's definitely a good idea and I

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,500
know that I've seen Doc's that do stuff

00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,600
like that where you'll have a sort of a

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,510
quick easy way to go straight from the

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,740
documentation to opening an issue I

00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,780
think that's a good idea

00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,340
I think lowering the sort of barrier to

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,960
giving that feedback makes more people

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,320
make makes people more likely to give

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,320
that feedback

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,380
yeah

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,220
mm-hmm yeah absolutely the the more you

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,660
can lower that barrier the the more

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,240
likely you are to really get feedback

00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,590
and think the better off everyone is the

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,180
users better off because they have to do

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,530
less work to tell you about a problem

00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,820
and the maintainer czar better off

00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:12,740
because they're gonna get probably more

00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,940
feedback have fewer people who just

00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,910
decide all this isn't worth the trouble

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,910
and move on yes

00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,350
yeah

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,799
mmm-hmm it is

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,170
mm-hm

00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,090
yeah I agree I think it's easy just

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,080
because like Russ doc is is there for

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,120
everyone that's been there for a while

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,539
to sort of forget that it's really cool

00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,799
that Rostock exists and is there it's

00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:22,120
it's valuable I guess I when you don't

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,120
have it it's something you really miss

00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,490
yeah oh I should I should explain the

00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,170
term meet-cute for anyone is unfamiliar

00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,150
the meet-cute is a term that comes from

00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:43,700
film it's the name for sort of the scene

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,570
where like like two characters happened

00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,640
like who's gonna have some sort of

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,020
romantic interest first meet you calmly

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,510
see it and like romantic comedies and

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:53,110
stuff so it's that first scene where two

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,110
characters meet

00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,659
yeah I think it depends that they're

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,950
sort of as I see it people coming from

00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,830
crates Taiyo there's sort of two ways

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,929
you could consider linking to things

00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:14,580
about the the documentation link and you

00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:16,169
also would have like the repository link

00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,640
and so I think you want to make sure

00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:19,620
that both of those places are

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,840
potentially directing people to a

00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,880
walkthrough I've also seen for for

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,010
smaller crates that you'll sort of put

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,600
the walkthrough in the the crate level

00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,700
documentation so like when you first hit

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,500
the the rust doc Doc's that that has

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,480
sort of a quick Rock walkthrough at the

00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,950
beginning and I think for smaller crates

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,240
that can be a good thing although

00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:40,559
obviously for larger crates that can

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,510
become really unwieldy and awful sorry I

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,710
think that that's a be the way to do it

00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,230
it might be interesting actually to

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:50,700
provide some weight right in in rust

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,809
dock to like have block buttons of some

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,340
sort where you could put like at the top

00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:54,720
of your first page like your crate

00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,610
documentation of link which is very big

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,409
and obvious to say hey if you want to

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,120
walk through go here rather than like a

00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:02,100
smaller text ruling and that may be

00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:06,559
something to do in in rust doc to make

00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,559
directing people that way easier

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,630
it

00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,540
sure I use asking is the the rust

00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:23,400
ecosystem largely English centered and I

00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:28,250
would say I haven't looked at the whole

00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:30,660
thing but yes I would I believe so and

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,870
that's another thing I think to to think

00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:35,160
about is the possibility of providing

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,660
documentation in in other languages

00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,460
although obviously often there you're

00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,110
gonna be relying on other people I need

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,360
to find people essentially who are

00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,010
willing to contribute translations I

00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,170
know this is something that the rust

00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,520
website has been working on fairly

00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:50,730
recently added started adding

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,140
alternative translations and now working

00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,240
on improving those and adding to those

00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,370
making the rust website available in

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,810
other languages it's it's a real process

00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,810
but it's also I think very valuable

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,110
I don't believe so but someone could

00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,830
correct me if I'm wrong

00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,830
okay

00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,940
any whales yes

00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:28,500
yes yes for anyone who's not familiar

00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:30,970
you can use a attribute on your crate to

00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,300
cause a build to fail if you are missing

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,530
documentation on your public API now

00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,270
obviously this can't check that the

00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,520
documentation is good it could just

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,990
check that it's there but but that's it

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,150
that's at least a really solid starting

00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:47,280
point and it's something I think that

00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,280
everyone should do yes

00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,920
okay cool I didn't know about that

00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,420
awesome so if anyone who couldn't hear

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,240
he was saying that there's a a clippie

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,800
lint that does some some sort of

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,680
checking of the the text inside of your

00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,950
comments for certain attributes so

00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:21,280
that's really cool

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:22,130
anyone else okay well thank you very

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:27,859
much

00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:27,859
