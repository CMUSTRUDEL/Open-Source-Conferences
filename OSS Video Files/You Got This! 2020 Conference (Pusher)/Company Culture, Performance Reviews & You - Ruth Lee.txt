Title: Company Culture, Performance Reviews & You - Ruth Lee
Publication date: 2020-02-16
Playlist: You Got This! 2020 Conference
Description: 
	"Culture fit". The dreaded phrase we all love to hear in our rejection letters, but culture's more than just being a cis white dude. In this talk I'll discuss engineering culture, particularly around approaches to risk and maturity of processes in companies of different sizes. This talk is aimed at helping junior engineers understand how this culture impacts performance reviews and how to adapt to flourish in different company environments.

You'll get the low down on engineering team culture from a business perspective. We'll cover what culture is (approach to risk) and isnâ€™t (free snacks). Company and team culture archetypes (startup vs. mature) and suggest which suit different career and comfort levels.

We'll also look at how company culture impacts your career especially the effect on performance reviews and feedback. How you should account for this in your own self assessment, and strategies for assessing stated versus actual culture.

Ruth is an Engineering Manager for the Site Reliability Team at Splunk. She's been a Linux engineer for almost a decade during which time she's developed an unhealthy obsession with the topic of time in computing. Outside of work you can find her on a mountain, the sea, or at the gym powerlifting.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
so I'm here today to talk about company

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,620
culture performance reviews and you and

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,750
I might as well kick it off so I've

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,639
already been introduced but I am a site

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,349
reliability engineering manager at a

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,550
company called spunk and I work on our

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:20,010
cloud product but a sysadmin for nine

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,769
years so if you have Linux questions I

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,060
am unfortunately the person to ask and

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,099
I've been a manager for about a year so

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,619
I do know what it's like to be an

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,630
individual contributor or I see as we

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,830
call them my manager round so this is

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,050
written from the perspective when I was

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,140
still an engineer before I became a

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,030
manager so I do have a confession I've

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,620
just finished the mandalorian and I'm

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,270
back in my obsessed with Star Wars face

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,730
so there's going to be a running theme

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,809
here if you are a Star Trek fan I'm

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,940
really sorry that you're not gonna get

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,730
these analogies but also watch the

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,890
Mandalorian um so you might be wondering

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,620
why I have two pictures of Yoda on the

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,430
screen or for real fans a baby of the

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,079
Yoda species and Yoda himself that's

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,930
because basically in this talk I want to

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,540
take you from the child essentially lost

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,430
and confused in the galaxy to Yoda who

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,210
I'm pretty sure even Star Trek fans

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,490
can't agree knows what's up so this is

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,530
what we're gonna cover today and yeah it

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,090
looks kind of dry so instead of reading

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,159
through every single slot point on this

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,500
slide what I want to talk to you about

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,720
is an experience that I had that's the

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,240
reason that I decided to write and give

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
this talk basically so I was growing a

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,619
company a and Company B but it's kind of

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,450
been spoilered by saying the companies I

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,070
work for so you'd have worked it out in

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,710
any way I'm gonna say nice things so

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,810
I'll use their actual names so I started

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,090
my Linux sis admin career almost a

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,700
decade ago distressing to say that at

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,860
Rackspace I was there for five years and

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,649
I had a great time it was a really good

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,780
environment for me I progressed a lot I

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,250
was promoted a couple of times and one

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,140
of the things I was really conscious to

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,939
do while I was there is take on the

00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,460
feedback that I was given by my managers

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,380
specifically in my performance reviews I

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,210
really spend a lot of time thinking

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,430
about that feedback and working on the

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,020
things that they suggested that I should

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,660
cut to two years ago I decided to switch

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,450
crews and I came in as a senior site

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,360
reliability engineer at Spike and I was

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,850
having a great

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,800
months starting off and then it came to

00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,970
performance review time spunk does

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,950
things a little bit differently they

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,630
actually also ask all of your peers and

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,040
random people you may have spoken to in

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,190
the business for feedback and then give

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,750
all of that to you so I was nervous

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,580
going into the performance review but I

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,140
can't I knew what I was gonna get I knew

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,370
what I should work on from my old job

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,660
and what I was good at from my old job

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,760
and because my manager sat me down and

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,230
started to list things and I went oh god

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,209
it's all the things I was bad at from my

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,620
old job and then he said these are the

00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,150
best things that you do we're so glad

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,060
you're here like what strength Wow

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,610
amazing and and you could imagine that

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,000
that was a little bit disconcerting for

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,040
me I was pretty sure I'd been punked but

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,690
what it did do is it made me go away and

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,209
think that doesn't make any sense how

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,520
can something in one job be pitched as a

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,650
weakness or a hindrance and then in the

00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,290
other job suddenly it's a massive

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,050
benefit so I've spent the last year

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,640
thinking about that as a manager and as

00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,380
a manager I can tell you there's no easy

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,390
answers to any of these questions but

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,130
what I can do is give you a broad set of

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,320
assumptions that we can make about

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,000
different companies and then how you can

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,830
career plan around that to kind of get

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,799
the most out of it and basically do real

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:29,320
well in your performance reviews so when

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,239
the dictionary defines culture as the

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,060
ideas customs and behaviors of a

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,100
particular people or society and in tech

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,110
we love to talk about culture we want to

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,970
talk about drinks after work we want to

00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,450
talk about how my office has scooters

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:45,340
and a slide and we also really like to

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,500
talk about it as a way to keep anyone

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,870
who's not a white sis man out of our

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,220
teens but I'm not talking about a kind

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,989
of culture I'm actually gonna talk about

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,600
business culture so that's how the

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:57,070
culture of the whole organization

00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,630
permeates a team and impacts performance

00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,510
reviews feedback and your career

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,250
opportunities so sometimes it's easier

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,170
to talk about what something isn't to

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,570
give you a better idea and so that's

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,600
what I'm gonna do now everything on this

00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:13,209
list it's not company culture it's a

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,070
compensation package these don't

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,200
indicate anything about company culture

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,930
your company provides to you in order to

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,450
create a competitive package to attract

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,729
employees it's instead of or on top of

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,520
salary and stock compensation these

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,960
perks also tend to be

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,180
thinly-veiled ways to ensure that you

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,979
spend more time at work and if not that

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,560
that the time at work that you do spend

00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:36,990
is mainly spent at your desk so not

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
culture these are other things that are

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,919
often stated as culture on company

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,930
websites you know baseline humanity

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,580
shouldn't have to list these that's not

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,750
culture that's what I expected the human

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,629
from you so what is culture then well

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,190
it's about risk for those of you who are

00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:56,610
young and don't understand this this is

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,770
a the death star so what are we willing

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,289
to gamble in order to get our big payday

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:04,020
or death star explosion if you've not

00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:08,370
seen Star Wars but it was a very risky

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,580
move so culture is about risk right risk

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,520
is the exposure of something to danger

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,680
harm or loss so we're always trading off

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,009
risk with what we gain if we take that

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,110
risk

00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,370
that means that there's two ways that we

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,169
generally think about risk when you

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,560
think about it you say what could I lose

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:27,870
and hey what could I gain and turns out

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,819
that they've done Studies on this and

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,400
humans have something called a cognitive

00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,960
bias that's been named risk aversion so

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,800
basically means that we will always

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,380
choose not to lose what we have over any

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,310
potential gain we will always be more

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,500
prone to preserving what we already have

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,000
TLDR your brain hates losing as someone

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,610
who's been banned from a lot of family

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,979
monopoly games I can confirm that what

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,469
does that have to do with business then

00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:58,349
what else money all business decisions

00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:00,719
involve evolve around risk and risk for

00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:02,219
a business and let me be clear I'm

00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:04,889
talking about capitalist business here

00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:06,719
so like NGOs it doesn't count but for a

00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,880
business most of them are explicitly

00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,949
catalyst so the number one rule they

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,479
have is to make money that means the

00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:16,469
thing they don't want to expose to risk

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,990
money so we can basically boil a

00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:21,000
company's culture all the way down to

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,289
risk management how much risk are they

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,849
willing to take on how much money are

00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,190
they willing to potentially lose in

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:28,110
order to achieve their business goals

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,340
once we kind of understand that and we

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,440
also know they keep a bias for loss

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,449
aversion you can begin to extrapolate

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,120
that into the idea that the larger more

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:37,830
successful a company becomes the more

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,899
risk-averse their naturally going to be

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,230
they have more to lose they have more

00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,450
cuts

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,190
more money and often especially if their

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,650
IP owed they have to report to

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,790
shareholders on top of that in contrast

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,040
if you're a younger company maybe

00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,450
startup with a bunch of VC money you're

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,250
probably gonna be more willing to take

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,940
on a lot of risk because what is VC

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,340
funding it's not just fancy gambling so

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,590
much like the force there must always be

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,440
a balance if we don't want to have risk

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,630
how can we mitigate that risk how can we

00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,460
reduce it well it's achieved through the

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,730
introduction of everyone's most hated

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,830
word process process here I'm using

00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:17,040
really generally so I'm just referring

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,320
to anything that has provides a way of

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,960
creating repeatability and expected

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,270
outcomes so that can range from anything

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,460
from a run book for how to make a change

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,320
it might be automation that means the

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,670
same result always happens or it might

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,280
be something like your onboarding

00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,800
documentation or a structure around how

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,810
you do hiring or reviews it essentially

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,690
means we risk less because we know

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:42,420
exactly what the outcomes should be now

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,040
from a personal engineering level you

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,570
can begin to see that this generally

00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,350
provides us two very different

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,640
environments or cultures that's because

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,780
there's two main ways that engineering

00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,250
teams reduce risk

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,770
one is through limiting the impact of

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,060
individual change to affect large areas

00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,250
you may have heard this referred to as

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,230
blast radius and your managers love to

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,510
say that and the other is through

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,160
providing documentation and training to

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,560
their engineers this minimizes human

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,970
error bad but it also means happy

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,170
employees which means they don't leave

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,180
which means I don't have to spend all

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,400
that money getting someone from 0 to 100

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,990
what will that look like for you and how

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,930
can you think about companies in that

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,820
way to benefit your career growth we're

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,870
saying with this art war theme we're

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,990
gonna start talking about high risk

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,930
right this usually takes the form of

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,670
maybe a startup or a small product team

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,270
in a larger company it's focusing on a

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:35,099
brand new area right these are risk

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,900
heavy teams they're han Solo and Chewie

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,060
right we're good at as you go along

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,490
shoot-from-the-hip he shot first doesn't

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,470
matter he's dead like we said here

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,030
there's always downsides right you you

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,520
might do really well you might end up

00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,860
famous for your real fast ship or you

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,050
might end up frozen in carbonite but in

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,020
this kind of an organization an engineer

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,390
can make a big impact fat

00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,190
however they'll generally spend a lot of

00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,900
time not really knowing what's going on

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,400
the organization could panic react to

00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,890
events a lot and there's generally a lot

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,810
of change so there's almost always going

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,620
to be a large degree of ambiguity and

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,360
just well let's see what happens so this

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,130
is also I'd like to add where you're

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,030
most likely to personally break

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:19,130
production in some catastrophic manner

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,290
so this kind of environment is great for

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,450
someone who might be already pretty

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,220
confident in their technical skills or

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,450
if you're at the start of your career he

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,950
might be the kind of person who just

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,210
loves to throw themselves in the deep

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,150
end if he was that kid in swimming class

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,430
you like dove off the highest high

00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:38,180
boards no that was not me I was in there

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:39,560
like on the second step crying but it

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,300
also generally means there's a lot less

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,910
support in documentation so you'll have

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,500
to figure things out as you go and if

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,820
you're someone who's able to help mentor

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,230
or produce that documentation and

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,780
probably do pretty well in this kind of

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,540
a company so what's the opposite side

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,120
well it's the Jedi so these are very

00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,130
risk-averse cultures they normally take

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,340
the form of more mature organizations so

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,080
we could think of like Dell perhaps so

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,940
these guys have years of established

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,800
wisdom and that results in lots of

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,240
training and mentorship you usually get

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,560
to learn and experiment in a really

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,140
secure environment they generally have

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,390
like good tests and you can't just push

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,890
stuff to prod that will break it and

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,590
they're often built to teach you to grow

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,030
engineers usually that also means that

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,800
you get to do things that have a pretty

00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,350
large scope because they generally have

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,470
a big large infrastructure so that can

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,060
give you a little bit of a foot up into

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,250
thinking about broader architectural

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,320
issues the downside is that the Jedi are

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,540
slow to adapt and they have a lot of

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,540
meetings all of those cancel scenes that

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:41,480
are in the star war zone you understand

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,880
right so they are a good place to learn

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,140
how to make large changes at scale but

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,270
you do need to gain a lot of great

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,770
consensus to do it and you often have to

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,010
go through a long period where you're

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:55,130
earning that influence essentially so

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,810
these can be great companies to start

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,940
out a career in a really strong learning

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,250
environment somewhere that you feel safe

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,900
that if you make an error a test fails

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,240
and someone's gonna come say oh you test

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,500
failed instead of all of the phones in

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,149
the company are suddenly gonna start

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,350
it can also be a really good place to

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:11,940
come to you when you're ready senior

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,810
level and you want to start working on

00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,670
skillsets that involve more more areas

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,319
of getting buy-in from other people how

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,600
do i influence other people to come

00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:23,850
around to my pattern of thinking so

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,009
those sound like pretty extreme signs

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,899
and you probably aren't going to end up

00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:29,730
in one or the other realistically most

00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,670
companies and most of us end up like

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,050
Princess Leia you have Bose on hand for

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,199
the right time in place and hopefully

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:40,350
you do not choose your sibling but for

00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:41,939
the most part we will kind of oscillate

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,339
between these two poles right the

00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:46,019
companies tend to grow in one direction

00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,850
while we as engineers may go back and

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,490
forth depending on how our skill sets

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,290
develop for the most part you'll end up

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,879
working out which kind of culture we

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,009
feel most comfortable in and where our

00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,360
strengths align now you'll notice that

00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,620
I've said strengths a couple of times

00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,910
and I want to be really clear that I'm

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,069
not talking about technical strengths

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:04,740
I'm not talking about whether oh cool

00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:08,490
I'm a kubernetes engineer or I write

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,620
really good PHP in fact I'm talking

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,970
about things like a broader set of

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,639
skills so I'm really good at writing

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,250
clear documentation or I'm a fantastic

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,569
teacher and people really tend to

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,660
understand these when I've explained

00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:23,399
them to them so essentially some of us

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,720
are built to be Yoda and some of us just

00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,139
want to blow stuff up with our blasters

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,769
and some of us don't care so there's one

00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,930
caveat to this which is culture sits at

00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:36,149
many layers so a company can be mature

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,709
and really risk-averse and still have

00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:39,449
smaller teams that are accepting of a

00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:41,040
lot more risk that's normally a

00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:43,139
greenfield project or a company that

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,019
suddenly decided to buy a small start-up

00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,819
and just that's our new product you do

00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,059
need to consider all of these aspects

00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:53,220
when generalizing company culture but

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,980
one thing that is true is that if you're

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,769
at a mature company but in a highly

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,779
risky team they're going to be able to

00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,370
become mature at a much faster rate than

00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,470
a start-up normally will because they

00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,329
just go to the main parent company and

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,709
take all that process so they don't have

00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:10,199
to work it out so it will generally

00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:12,569
become more mature faster then I started

00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,899
up so I said this was going to be about

00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:18,300
performance reviews and I promise it is

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:20,430
so here's how this fits in if you take

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,020
one thing away from today

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,390
what I would like you to take from this

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,940
talk is that performance has nothing to

00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,490
do with how smart you are or how good an

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,560
engineer you are performance reviews are

00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,930
about how effectively your strengths

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,080
assist the business in achieving its

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,730
goals a high performer is an individual

00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,860
whose strengths and working preferences

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,050
align with the culture of the team and

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,520
now there's always growth in any

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,529
feedback right you should always listen

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,910
to it but you should also understand

00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:50,580
that all of that feedback is always

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,140
going to be situationally specific so

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,700
why you should listen to it and take it

00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,440
on board remember to contextualize it

00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,020
within the larger culture of the team

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,850
and the business at the beginning of

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,040
this I said I had a personal example and

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,870
it really is personal these are three

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,240
pieces of feedback that were delivered

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:08,970
to me I want to be clear that this

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,130
feedback was not wrong at either time it

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,500
reflected my performance in the context

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,910
of the company that I was working in so

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,300
there are some things you can probably

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:20,399
guess in this feedback and also by what

00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,950
I've been saying in this talk which is

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,410
essentially that I'm pretty good at

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:27,240
working out inefficiency it's one of the

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,589
things I love to do I find in an

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,660
efficiency whether it's in an

00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:35,700
engineering context or a process context

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,170
and I want to fix it yesterday I also am

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,300
NOT trying to give my opinions in

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,640
meetings I will pretty much say this is

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,730
how I think we should do it feedback no

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,560
great we're doing it another thing I'm

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,540
pretty good at and that I like doing is

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,630
writing technical documentation I like

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,279
documenting a process or basically

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,940
building a path for the person coming

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,560
behind me to follow along so what I'm

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,430
going to do is discuss just a little bit

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:06,390
how this feedback essentially was given

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:09,209
to me so at my first job rocks - it was

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,709
a much more mature company right so when

00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,420
I would turn up and I would see a

00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,209
process that I thought was ineffective

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,770
or frankly dumb I would turn around I

00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:19,200
would say yo this sucks like let's

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,029
change it now and that wasn't great

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,410
because there was a lot of context

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:23,459
behind engineering decisions that had

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,470
happened there there were a lot of

00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:27,240
people involved a lot of different teams

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,459
that relied on a lot of those systems

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,190
and having someone turn up and want to

00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:34,030
just flip it and change how we did it it

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,280
wasn't necessarily great for

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:39,700
risk-averse business that didn't like to

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,500
take too many risks um so that was some

00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,410
feedback that I was given is hey work on

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,000
this build larger consensus you don't

00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:49,600
need to change every single tiny thing

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,820
that's wrong right now similarly it was

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,100
a really mature company so my desire to

00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:57,130
write a lot of documentation to write

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,140
Warren piece and my JIRA updates that

00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,910
was seen as my manager is a bit of a

00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,940
waste of time right we already have

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:07,090
documentation for it so just write I fix

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:11,290
the problem you don't need to write 20

00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:13,930
lines about how you fixed it um so you

00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:16,960
can see how in a more jedi-like

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,310
organization these strengths just didn't

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,430
quite align with what they were looking

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:24,040
for um when I moved to spunk

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,600
we were a much younger organization

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,850
spunk is quite a mature company but the

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,890
cloud department at the time was a

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:33,730
little bit less mature in our processes

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:36,160
so turning up and saying hey see this um

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,110
this thing we have isn't great can I try

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,610
something they would just say yes

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,650
because a lot of the time the context

00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:45,400
for why that decision had been made was

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:48,040
usually it was fastest or I just had

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,870
done it before that way so that suddenly

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,940
became this real strength I was turning

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,860
up and I was fixing problems as they as

00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,080
they popped up and because we were a

00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,520
little bit more happy to have risk it

00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,810
was fine if I wanted to try something

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,370
and if it went wrong I would just revert

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,530
it not a big deal

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,870
similarly we were a young company we

00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,790
didn't have much context pretty much

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:09,130
everything I did in the first six months

00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,900
I had never done before and I could

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,260
never find any evidence of anyone else

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,910
having done before so my own meaning to

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,290
documenting things was suddenly this

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,079
huge strength where people were saying

00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:24,270
oh it's great that you wrote 37 wiki

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:27,280
pages this week that was a really useful

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:30,040
time think for you essentially now we're

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,590
very lucky that um we have technical

00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,060
writers for that so they've taken them

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:38,650
and made them neat and taken out all my

00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:40,660
funny references sadly so here's the

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,780
thing that culture that I just described

00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,670
that's blank well it shifted so much

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,410
from when I started we're now becoming

00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,830
more and more risk-averse which is great

00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,210
because

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,630
we're successful we have stuff to lose

00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,769
now we have customers who would be upset

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,570
so does that mean it's time for me to

00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:59,559
get a new job because all my strengths

00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,690
are useless no there is in fact 20 of

00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:04,059
scopes still for us to bring in new

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,919
process for us to improve efficiencies

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:07,269
and one of the cool things is I can now

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,890
leverage a lot in that process that I

00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:10,570
learned hurt a more mature organization

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:14,169
and I can take the bits that worked and

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,179
I can apply them and seem like a hero so

00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:18,159
I've now found the strengths that I want

00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,809
to develop and focus on and I know that

00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,730
they're particularly beneficial to a

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,470
business that somewhere in the middle

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,510
that's coming from start-up into

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,480
maturity and doesn't really know how to

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,639
do that so I can kind of understand that

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,960
the thing that you need to do is keep an

00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:33,580
eye on your strengths how they're

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,409
changing areas you might want to grow

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,570
into and also your company because

00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:39,580
companies change and a job that you love

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,830
today and is an amazing role for you in

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:45,460
six to twelve months time just might not

00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:48,610
be the right fit so that being said how

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,620
do we work this system well check-ins

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,600
and I've had a couple of whirring

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,690
conversations that imply people are not

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,480
getting regular performance reviews um

00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:59,860
sucks yell at your managers but also if

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,779
your managers not giving you a

00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,360
performance review you should be given

00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:06,490
yourself a performance review a

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,830
self-evaluation essentially keep your

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,809
brad document go through it check that

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,250
you're on on part but instead of just

00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:14,889
having technical skills in there I'd say

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,299
also put in other strengths like turns

00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:19,059
out I'm really good at getting things

00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:20,799
through change approval board or hey

00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,870
I've been mentoring and it's been going

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,200
really well and I really enjoy that so

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,909
periodically evaluate your own growth

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,039
crowdsource it speak to your colleagues

00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:31,419
speak to your managers speak to managers

00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,179
of other teams colleagues on adjacent

00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:37,840
teams and then assess whether what they

00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:38,740
think that cultural alignment is does it

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,840
match what they're actually doing

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,360
because a lot of the time it's not going

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,610
to if they say oh we're very risk-averse

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,200
we don't want to break anything but no

00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:50,139
one ever has to review your PRS before

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,230
you put them into production I'm a

00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:54,760
question that so generally just think

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,940
about the strengths you'd like to foster

00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,889
and how they might be useful to the

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,290
business in its march towards maturity

00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:03,000
and more process and then

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,130
make sure these overlap to hyperspeed

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,450
your career growth how to assess it's

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,640
all well and good that I say assess it

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,890
but I don't tell you how these are a few

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,780
questions that are really useful the

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,250
answers to these questions will help you

00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,290
to judge how much process and

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,490
documentation exists around the engineer

00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,380
and work you're doing day to day

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,750
this can help you judge how risk-averse

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,430
your team is and this goes not just for

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,800
say code that you're writing it also

00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,440
goes for things like hey if we hire a

00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,050
new person do I know what to do with

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,450
them on the first day do I know what to

00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,430
do with them two weeks down the line

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,980
again all of this will tell you where

00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,600
your company is going to eventually

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,820
because everyone marches towards

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,110
maturity and process is going to need to

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,110
put these into place and where your

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,180
strengths can align with this um s ellos

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,460
are also a really nice one because they

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,380
are a literal percentage of how much the

00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,860
business cares about down time so

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,180
they're neat if you can use them so

00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,780
we've asked our questions we brought our

00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:04,020
answers how do we actually leverage this

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:06,270
to our benefits how do we form a plan

00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,500
well if your preferences and strengths

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,330
seem like they're a good fit for the

00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,310
current culture that's great start

00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,540
working with your manager to find out

00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:15,210
where you think they can have the most

00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:18,990
impact and I'm gonna break out a little

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:21,180
bit from our Star Wars analogies for the

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:22,920
next slide basically I've said talk to

00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,440
your managers if your manager is not

00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,450
useful talk to another manager hopefully

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,610
he knows a bit about your team now why

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,140
have I told you not to just find a

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,700
senior engineer or a different mentor

00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,740
well that's because I think that there's

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,530
a very specific thing about a manager

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,180
who manages on your team or near to your

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,860
team that they can offer you and should

00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,050
be offering you so I'm gonna break away

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,540
from Star Wars and go to my number-one

00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,620
obsession women's football I know that

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,800
this is not necessarily a sports

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,890
audience so I will be very clear this is

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,900
Julie Earth's Julie arts is a

00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:57,690
centre-back defender on the u.s.

00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,430
national women's team in 2015 when they

00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,620
won the World Cup for the first of two

00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,020
back-to-back times she played every

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,810
single minute as a defensive center back

00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,780
right she then goes back to Chicago her

00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:12,150
local team and she continues to play

00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,620
send her back the back line there under

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,090
her mentorship becomes really really

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,550
strong

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,470
but what happens in 2016 is that we

00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:22,070
realize our midfield that's the middle

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,540
of the pitch is really lacking we have

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,010
good players but honestly they're tiny

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,630
they're shorter than me and they just

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,170
get bumped off the ball it's distressing

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:32,210
to watch so what our coach decides to do

00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,800
is he says let's take Julie who maybe

00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:36,770
you can't see to scale here but the

00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,730
woman is big like you would run away if

00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,790
she was running towards you on a

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:42,320
football pitch and he says Julie you're

00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,550
going to attacking midfield

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,890
now again you don't need to know much

00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:50,060
about sports but defender attacker the

00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:51,620
same so what the reason that this is

00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,780
important is because basically that's a

00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,300
decision that only a Cutts can make the

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,640
coach understands that the midfield is

00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,160
where the business slashed the football

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,930
team needs to focus and he's taken the

00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,240
strengths that he sees in an individual

00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,740
and moved them into that position now it

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,330
turns out she did great there because

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,460
what we needed was a little bit of brute

00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:14,750
force and she absolutely brought that

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:16,640
and in the 2019 Olympics she once again

00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,080
played almost every minute but in fact

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,850
most of that was in an attacking

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,820
midfield role and sometimes dropping

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:25,970
back into defense so that entire story

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,190
is basically about how if you and your

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,540
coach or your manager are aligned you

00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,970
can work out how to make yourself

00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,010
indispensable right a good center back

00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,930
is always gonna be decent but one who

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,090
can suddenly switch to attack and then

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:41,150
drop back when they need to that was a

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:43,610
great example of aligning a player's

00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,440
development with what the team needed

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:48,170
and there we can see how that really

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,160
just shoots your career up to the next

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,660
level essentially so use your manager

00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,160
another engineer is not gonna be seeing

00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,570
the bigger picture of who they're gonna

00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,770
draft next season and what their

00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,810
opponent's weaknesses are

00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,630
it really does sit with your manager to

00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:05,030
be able to give you that perspective

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,740
perfect so the takeaway from this there

00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,210
is no wrong place I don't want anyone to

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,890
feel like I'm in the wrong place for the

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,260
wrong stage of my career there's many

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,230
areas that can help you focus on

00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,940
different strengths and skill sets

00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,440
ideally you want to be in a place where

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,210
what you view as your strengths are the

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,280
same thing that's what your boss and

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,380
your teammates view as your strengths so

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,880
know what areas you're strong in or

00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,970
areas that you might like to grow into

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,060
and then think about the company

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:33,120
and kind of use a a bit of a yardstick

00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,620
to guess that I've given you from this

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,090
and when you find that you can align the

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,290
strengths of what you bring to a

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:41,110
business and what the business needs

00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:42,820
from you and from engineers then you'll

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,350
find yourself getting consistently

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,380
strong performance reviews and plenty of

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,300
opportunities to advance that's my talk

00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,600
thank you you can find me at all of

00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:58,450
these places and we are always hiring so

00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,450
