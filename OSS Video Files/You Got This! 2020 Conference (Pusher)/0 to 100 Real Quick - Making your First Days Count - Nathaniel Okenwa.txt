Title: 0 to 100 Real Quick - Making your First Days Count - Nathaniel Okenwa
Publication date: 2020-02-16
Playlist: You Got This! 2020 Conference
Description: 
	Hooray! You’ve landed your first full-time tech job, but what comes next? The first few months can be daunting and it is easy to feel like you don’t belong. In this talk, we look at some useful strategies to help you navigate your rookie year.

Last year, I started my first full-time role as a Developer Evangelist. Speaking with fellow newbies, I realised how similar our experiences were. Over the past 12 months, I have collected useful learnings to guide others through this early phase of their careers. Whether you’re new in tech and looking for your first role, a new hire just starting or a manager onboarding juniors, this talk will provide you with a checklist of actionable practices to ace your first year.

Nathaniel is a Developer Evangelist at Twilio working to create magical moments for developers with their products. He is a die hard fan of JavaScript, sports, superheroes and mixed martial arts. His life goals are to have Batman's brains, Deadpool's humour, T'Challa's fashion sense, Killmonger's Wokeness, and Thanos' determination! He serves the Javascript community in the UK and the rest of Europe.

of my talk is zero to 100 real quick

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:12,540
inspired by the Drake lyric and and the

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,639
reason why I decided to come up with

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,170
this talk is because about a year ago I

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,869
actually did work it to the earth I mean

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,180
been working here for seven months and I

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,640
remember sitting down next to one of my

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,160
now colleagues that's video and telling

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,349
her that there's this amazing job called

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,810
the developer evangelist at video and I

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,590
don't think I can make it I I don't know

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,600
if I'm good enough

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,920
and they said apply because even though

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,210
you're a plague you may not think you

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,250
have the skills you have enough skills

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,050
to get started and you can improve as

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,940
you go so my name is Nathaniel you can

00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,600
refer to me as he him and you can find

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,649

00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,620
chatterbox coder in the bottom left and

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,300
if you've already come to the Twilio

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,500
table you will know why I'm called

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,359
chatterbox coder so like I said I was

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,520
really nervous and then I finally got my

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,860
job at my dream company the job that I

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,680
didn't think I was good enough for but I

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,299
really wanted to be good I wanted to

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,250
become one of the best and I wanted to

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,460
own this prove to Twilio that they did

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,900
not make a mistake in hiring me and it

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,180
forced me it made me do a lot of

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,189
research I looked for talks are that for

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,290
books and all of these different

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,659
resources to try and figure out how I

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,299
can make a big impact when I started and

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,560
this talk is just an amalgamation me

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,920
bringing all of those different

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,840
resources that I got together and one of

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,390
the resources that I got one of my

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,090
favorite ones was a book called the

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,899
first 90 days by Michael D Watkins and I

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,180
love this quote it says every successful

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,490
career is a series of a successful

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,340
assignments and every successful

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,159
assignment is launched with a success a

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,350
successful story transition now some of

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,299
you may not have your first job yet or

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,610
maybe you've just started or maybe

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,950
you've been working in tech for a couple

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,810
of years now this talk hopefully will

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,820
still be useful to you because your

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,789
career is made up of many transitions

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,289
and this talk will go through some of

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,420
the things that can help you make an

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,830
impact every time you step into a new

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,920
role or position

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,050
and I'm going to be using my timeline

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,350
the timeline that I experienced through

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,450
my first 100 days at trivia and this is

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,910
very personal to me and my experience

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,430
and what you may notice is as I talk

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,650
you'll begin to think well I wasn't I

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,540
didn't experience this at that stage or

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,000
I experienced this much more early and

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,490
that's fine every one of your journeys

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,200
or toe to be different but I think there

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,510
are some phrases that remain the same

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,930
across our different timelines and that

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,880
is observing understanding and creating

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,760
and I'm going to talk about how these

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,400
three phases really helped me maximize

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,490
my impact and get up to speed when I

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,350
started working that's with you so I'm

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,750
gonna start from the beginning day zero

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,760
you got the job I finally got the letter

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:08,430
and I could tweet about it online and

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:10,920
you might feel something like this so I

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,360
was dancing I was celebrating but more

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,160
than just those feelings there are many

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,530
other feelings that may be going through

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,430
your head at this point in time so the

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,160
of was obvious one is excitement you

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,500
feel good this feels good you've earned

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,320
it make sure you be proud of yourself

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,200
you deserve it you might also feel a bit

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,750
nervous but don't doubt yourself you

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,640
deserve to be there last year actually

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,160
at you got this there was an amazing

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,560
talk about impostor syndrome by Joe

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,440
Franchetti and one of my favorite things

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,090
from that talk was when she said that

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,459
having imposter syndrome is kind of

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,530
counterintuitive because do you really

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,510
believe that you are smart enough to

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,730
trick all of these very smart people

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,830
into thinking that you are smarter than

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,890
you actually are

00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,340
it gets a bit confusing but don't doubt

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:04,709
yourself you deserve to be there and

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,050
also support now I remember when I got

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:11,010
my job it's video and I tweeted and I

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,750
tagged video in it and the CEO of of

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,720
trivia actually I think he liked or

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,040
commented or retweeted or something and

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,620
immediately my father account just like

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,109
had a nice little bomb my phone wouldn't

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,990
stop beeping I felt really good but it's

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:27,030
more than just Twitter one of the people

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,200
who supported you on your journey your

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,530
colleagues in your be

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,720
or maybe their fellow students in your

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,730
university or maybe your friends at the

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,040
meet are put a mentor that has been

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,750
helping you learn to code all of those

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,240
people have been furthering you and one

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,990
succeed make sure you share your success

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,990
with them but we reach day one the first

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:51,090
day when you start and I will tell you

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,900
at my office it really it's almost

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:57,990
exactly about this so many new names to

00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,580
remember we have cake and cake every

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,680
time new start has come and I love it

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,930
it's amazing but there's so many new

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,470
names to remember so many new people to

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:10,140
make but sometimes being new can really

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,510
suck and I'm gonna talk about this I

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,610
listen to a talk and it was also called

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,610
the first 90 days and I was by a

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,920
gentleman called on and craft narnun

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,080
craft had an amazing opportunity

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,210
he lives in tel-aviv but he was going to

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,190
move to the United States for a new job

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,200
he was going to live in a big house in a

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,680
nice neighborhood him and his wife were

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,410
very excited but his seven-year-old son

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,210
wasn't so excited he's seven year old

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,910
son was a bit annoyed that they had to

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,860
move and he sat down and tried to speak

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,940
to his son to really get to the bottom

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,460
of his son's motivations and his son

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,320
kind of said a couple of different

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,510
things and on an oiled estonians of

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,880
three points that his son was saying

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:57,300
that everybody knows who I am here I

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,070
have friends I know so many people and I

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,570
might lose those relationships when I

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:06,360
move to the United States and these were

00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:09,270
not his actual words but he said I know

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,490
how to be successful that means he knows

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,230
where to give in his homework he knows

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,240
which teachers are really strict and

00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,770
also which teachers he can get away with

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,470
talking a little bit at the back of the

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,180
classroom and most importantly to his

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,210
seven-year-old son at a time

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,320
he knew what school he knew that wearing

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,240
his hair longest school

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,130
he knows what trainers are instar that

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,930
damn innit and he was really worried

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,850
that these things he won't be able to

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,670
take them with him when he went to the

00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:37,470
United States and it might feel like

00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,480
this is the typical thinking of a

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,639
seven-year-old but I think we even as

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,379
adults we still feel the same things

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,300
we just come up with different words for

00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,490
him and Arnon Kraft came up with

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,219
something that words for these he spoke

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,499
about reputation you have built a

00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:55,169
reputation wherever you've come from

00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:56,789
people at your university may know that

00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:58,650
you're a good coder or people at your

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:00,090
boot camp or Dementor he's been helping

00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,069
you knows about your skills and they

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,259
know that these are your strengths and

00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,849
when you go to this new place it might

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,550
feel that you may not be able to carry

00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:11,370
that reputation over with you and it can

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,439
sometimes feel intimidating also

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,389
commitments and purpose you knew what

00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,479
activities you needed to do and engage

00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:19,500
in to get you to this point and

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,960
sometimes you may be wondering to

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,090
yourself in this new position what

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,279
activities will I need to do to be

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,240
successful and will I be any good at

00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:33,689
those activities and sometimes most

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,620
importantly to us culture do I feel like

00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,529
I belong here

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,259
do I feel included will I get on with

00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:42,060
the other people in my office and I'm

00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,279
going to talk a little bit about some of

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,699
the activities that you can engage in to

00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,229
help you answer these intimidating

00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:52,439
questions omus that you might ask

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:53,939
yourself and some also bad practices

00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,349
that you should avoid to make sure you

00:07:53,939 --> 00:08:00,810
don't fall in certain traps so day 7 the

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:04,289
first week is down and for me this was

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,389
onboarding so we got up my laptop and I

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,509
got set up I understood all of the solve

00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:12,210
and office basics to get started and I

00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:14,580
find me sat down to work and this is

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,729
when I for me I began to first of those

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,800
three phases I mentioned earlier

00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:22,050
observing observation is one of the most

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,389
crucial steps when you start a new role

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,039
and there may be so many things that

00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,259
were not included in the onboarding

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,199
training what is the office culture like

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,300
what's the management style like who are

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,380
the key partners both internally and

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,360
externally and most important to me what

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,029
are the best office snacks making sure I

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,089
find those early and you need to go and

00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:48,050
gather as much information looking for

00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:50,550
all of those details in the new role and

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,440
while you're doing this you're also

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,390
going to need to avoid some transition

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,350
traps and these are things that it can

00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,330
be very easy

00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,030
to slip into when you get started and

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:03,270
they often get in the way from you being

00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,920
successful in your new role number one

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,560
is thick and exclusively to what you

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,240
know now you were hired because of what

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,680
you know but don't let that stop you

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,870
from opening yourself to new

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,700
opportunities there is going to be so

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,370
much that you can learn in your new role

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,110
and don't just rely on the things that

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,960
got you there but also look for

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,110
opportunities to add new tools to that

00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,180
toolkit and another thing you to avoid

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,460
is falling prey to the action imperative

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,380
now I struggle with this and this was

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,690
when I started feeling like I needed to

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,150
be working at a hundred percent on day

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,340
one and it's really important to

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,470
understand that you will need to have

00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,200
time to spin up to get there and don't

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,090
rush into it

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,220
another one is only focusing on learning

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,050
the technical part of the business now

00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,760
if any of you are active on Twitter you

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:55,230
may have heard of the 10x engineer this

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,330
year learning the overall business model

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,340
of your company and understanding the

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,130
business value of you your role in that

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,140
company can sometimes be as or maybe

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,840
even more important than just your tech

00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,000
skills all these tech adjacent skills

00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,580
are what allow your technical skills to

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,080
really shine so make sure you don't just

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,480
focus on those technical parts but you

00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,450
understand how they fit with the company

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,730
as a whole so I'll go back through these

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,590
again stick an exclusively to what you

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,320
know fallen prey to the action

00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,750
imperative and only focus in on learn at

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,130
a technical side of the business but

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,610
some good things that you should be

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:34,680
practicing is to negotiate success and

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,750
focus on building a productive working

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,190
relationship with your new manager it's

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,990
great that we've just followed a talk

00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,640
that sort of spoke about the managers

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,950
role in that and make sure you are

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,620
trying to communicate to build a solid

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,390
relationship from the get-go so schedule

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,400
meetings maybe with your manager and

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,350
other people in leadership not just your

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,050
direct manager but maybe other people

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,890
that you may be working with and another

00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,960
thing to do

00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,850
early is to keep your balance being

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,620
committed to your job is great however

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,770
don't over commit to an unsustainable

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,470
goal it can be very easy especially with

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,120
the action imperative to try and focus

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,529
only on work and

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,460
remember that you also have a life

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:17,040
outside of work so day 30 the first

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,930
month was down and for me this is when I

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,620
really began to move on to the next

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,430
phase which is understanding

00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,410
understanding the business that you're

00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,750
working you remember like I said before

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,279
your technical skills must be paired

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,680
with an understanding of the business

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,330
value that they bring and you take all

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,800
of those things that you've observed not

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,960
just about the way the business works

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,240
but by the office culture the management

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,070
style internal and external key partners

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,220
and you do the mental maps in your head

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:46,529
to come up with the answers and then

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,779
you've really begin to understand and

00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:52,140
there's some more bad behaviors that you

00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:54,779
should avoid and over plain D I'm still

00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,730
new card so you are new and your manager

00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,440
and your team notice and you do not have

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,930
to be perfect and you should still ask

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,400
for help but the way you should ask for

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,920
help should be reading into a

00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,050
constructive learning experience rather

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,210
than asking people just do it for you

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,890
clay Indy I am still new card I'm still

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,350
new I don't know how to do this can you

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,640
do it for me but rather ask them

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,380
questions and use it as an opportunity

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:21,300
to learn over nostalgia now a lot of

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,400
times not many of us have it early in

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,070
our careers but it can be this thing of

00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,470
back in my day in my old company or

00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:31,230
where I used to work we used to do it

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,670
this way now like I said before you were

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,410
hired because of all of that knowledge

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,290
and experience and skills that you bring

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,150
to the table but remember to also be

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,740
open to the things that you can learn

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,959
from where you are now and maybe

00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,770
integrate great demand comes up to

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,440
compromises and super hairy syndrome and

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:52,320
that is where someone over promises and

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,020
under delivers you can't save everyone

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,480
keep track of the commitments you make I

00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,070
actually just got in I didn't get in

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,500
trouble but someone told me off for this

00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,900
recently because last year our annual

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,730
conference and they asked people or what

00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,520
we'd like people like to volunteer for

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:12,570
next year and every time they said a

00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,010
topic I said me me me and now we're in

00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,620
the run up we're getting closer to our

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,020
conference and one of my team members

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,280
messaged me and said Nathaniel you

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,030
should not be doing this many things

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,220
drop some of them

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,110
really really useful to me I suffered

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,820
for superhero syndrome and it's

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,620
important to keep track of those

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,060
commitments and don't over promise and

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,430
over commit yourself to all of these

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,970
different tasks that you may not be able

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,710
to fulfill and hide-and-seek

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,170
this is another bad behavior to avoid

00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,060
and this is have you ever noticed that

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,620
person that you met on day one you shook

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,770
their hand you told them your name and

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,990
then you never see them again and then

00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:53,610
once a year at door all hands they pop

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:56,350
up and you're like wait you work here

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,780
now it's really important to understand

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,700
that the social networking that you will

00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:03,550
gain at the different places that you

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,620
work at is really really useful to your

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,450
career and it's important to not just

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,370
say hello on the first day and not make

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,320
an effort to go and interact and engage

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,270
of all of your colleagues and the people

00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,280
around you because those people can

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,080
often give you bits of advice and bits

00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,020
of learning that can help you really

00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,390
grow in your roles so I'll go back

00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,760
freedom bad behaviors are hide and seek

00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,640
or overplay the internal new card over

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,700
nostalgia superhero syndrome and then

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,150
hide and seek but some good practices

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:37,630
that you should do is to ask questions

00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:40,360
never be afraid of asking why something

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,220
funny at trivia is we love it's an

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,570
American company and Americans love

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:49,030
acronyms but CIA FBI it's just crazy

00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,280
and oftentimes I'm in meetings and

00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:53,860
acronyms will be used and I have no idea

00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,960
what they mean and finally I began to

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,030
pluck up the courage to put my hand up

00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,430
and say can you pause there what what

00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,200
does that acronym mean and what's so

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,570
funny is that after a while I noticed

00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,550
that so many other people in the company

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,250
have been working there longer than me

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,950
would say oh I didn't know that acronym

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,230
men either so make sure you ask

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,060
questions never be afraid of asking why

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,710
you're not challenging Authority by

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,480
asking why but you'll gain in an

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:22,200
understanding so you can take that I

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,670
have a better knowledge going forward

00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,160
and also make sure you use available

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,020
resources now one of the easiest

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,300
resources you can use is your managers

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,460
time and attention but also your company

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,470
will have education opportunities maybe

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,750
internally or externally may

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:40,360
she use all of those resources to gain a

00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,550
great understanding of your company your

00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,320
job understanding your role and your

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:48,460
technical skills and all of that

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,980
together and a 60 this for me was the

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,870
third one firm I began to feel confident

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,940
I was actually good at this I'd done a

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,260
few five-minute demos and they didn't go

00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,260
as a disaster

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,780
and this is when you can really move on

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,900
to my favorite phase which is where you

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:07,600
create it's your time to shine you're

00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:10,000
ready to take ownership now feel free to

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,370
revisit observing and understanding if

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,500
you need to it's an iterative process

00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,500
you constantly need to go and observe

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:20,500
and understand and then create and as

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,960
you continue to create you also have a

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,850
sense of Independence at Twilio we

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,620
represent this in our in our values we

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,750
have one of our values which is to draw

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,860
the owl and it comes from this famous

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:34,900
meme that you may recognize and how to

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,170
draw in our draw some circles and draw a

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:40,270
rest of the rest of the owl and what it

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,610
means is that there is no extra

00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,740
instruction but that details every

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,770
single thing you're going to need to do

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,720
to become successful at your role all of

00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,550
that understanding and observing that

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,530
you have doing has given you the tools

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,020
and everything you need to really just

00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,850
go out and do it I remember when I

00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,530
showed this to my friend and he said to

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,630
him it means stop talking about it and

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:04,630
just do it and there's almost an element

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:07,150
of sometimes you might end up asking too

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,860
many questions I take that back and you

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,720
can never ask too many questions but you

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,150
may expect someone to show you every

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,860
single step feel free and feel confident

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,730
in your skills in your decision-making

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:21,610
to be creative in your own way and as

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,800
you draw DL you'll begin to create value

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:26,800
and you'll reach something which we call

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,780
the break-even point now this is a very

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,640
popular business model but I've changed

00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,250
this diagram a little bit I've removed

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,620
the time line which is days after entry

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,060
because this is very different to very

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,880
different people in different situations

00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:42,550
if you're in a big company with lots of

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,410
complex business processes it may take

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:46,510
you a lot longer or as if you're in a

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,510
small company with maybe a one really

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,170
focused goal you might get up to speed

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:54,210
more quickly and I'll go for it so what

00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,700
happened is your company needed you at

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,950
some point and it's time and resources

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,890
to value it the amount of money that

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,690
goes into HR in companies is it's much

00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,450
more surprising than I thought it was

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,460
and they invested in you and at some

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,370
point they brought you one and they

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,200
hired you and at first they gave you so

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,940
much Randy they give you a salary to

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,500
give you training up whose opportunities

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,430
and you're consuming all of this value

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,590
but as you create you begin to offset

00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,570
this amount value that they've invested

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,980
in you and eventually reach a plate

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,620
where the amount of value that you have

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,660
created actually offsets and completely

00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,930
pays off or the value that you have

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,300
consumed now before I move on don't take

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,130
this as a monetary goal and do math and

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,320
workout okay it took them this much

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,030
money to hire me in to pay me therefore

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,580
I need to make this much money for the

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,380
company the value that you bring may not

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,600
come up in the shape that you think it

00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,580
is you might bring value by improving

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,640
the office culture or a new way of

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:56,280
thinking but see as an opportunity for

00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,260
you to create value in your new role for

00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,630
you to reach that breakeven point and

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,190
take advantage of all of the value

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,650
you're consuming all of the learning

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:08,490
opportunities that you have and use them

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:11,310
to create more value and then we reach

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,320
day 100 you're in the groove and you

00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:16,470
want to keep it 100 you want to keep the

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,080
momentum going and this is where I say

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,880
it's very important to recheck your

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,180
work-life balance I really like this

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,330
gift make sure that you make time for

00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:29,820
personal reflection outside work your

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,010
personal well-being is a key aspect to

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,600
your life and it enables you to succeed

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,780
just as much as your technical skills

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,700
and understanding your circumstances and

00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,950
where you as an individual have come

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,560
from is crucial to inform in the right

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,690
goals for yourself and you may find like

00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:48,180
I did that your personal life begins to

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,180
change with your new job I was listening

00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:53,010
to a talk last year and by a colleague

00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,540
called Michelle Crozier and she

00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,730
described the phenomenon known as a

00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,470
class traveler that I really identified

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,030
with and I'm going to talk about it and

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,160
a class strether

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,110
is someone who grew up in a blue

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,350
the situation and now has a white-collar

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:09,750
life and I identify as a car straggler I

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:12,180
sometimes when I'm with friends that I

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,000
grew up with I feel like quite fit in

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,130
with with them anymore and sometimes I

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,660
feel overly privileged by the fact that

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,520
I have free lunch and I sometimes

00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:24,990
complained at the lunch isn't what I

00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:28,320
wanted very stark contrast and

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:30,420
oftentimes it can mean that I I act

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,030
really formally in very casual

00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,370
situations or I forget to ask for help

00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,430
and feel really awkward requesting

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,530
connections and them especially

00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:42,450
intimidated by people I perceive as in

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,210
management or much more successful than

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,610
me now you may or may not be a class

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,830
traveler what truly matters is

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,810
understanding how your new job and the

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,420
experiences that come with it will

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,070
affect your life recognizing how your

00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,930
experiences will shape your

00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,700
understanding of worker working life

00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,520
will prepare you for some of the

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,910
encounters that you may interact with

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,740
along the way and the next thing is to

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,500
infinity and beyond even I don't know

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,420
now the first time I gave this slide

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,240
sorry I gave this talk I was a hundred

00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,610
days of working at trivia I've just gone

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,100
past 200 days but he's keeping up

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:23,070
I've just gone past 200 days and even I

00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,470
don't know what the next step is but

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,890
remember that your career is a marathon

00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:31,950
not a sprint but you can ensure a strong

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,710
start you can keep going through two

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,340
cycles of observing gathering as much

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,170
information about everything as you can

00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:44,450
understanding never shy away from asking

00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:47,610
why and then create go and draw diao and

00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:50,010
remember that every successful career is

00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,830
a series of successful assignments and

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:55,530
every successful assignment is launched

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,270
with a successful transition this may be

00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,220
you going for your first job or you've

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,500
just started your first job or maybe a

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,630
new job in a new role that a different

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,310
company you can use some of the things

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:08,130
I've spoken about in this talk to help

00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,720
you get started and keep me updated I'd

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,580
