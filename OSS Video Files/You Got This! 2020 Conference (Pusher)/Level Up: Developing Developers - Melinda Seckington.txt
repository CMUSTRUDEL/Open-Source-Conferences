Title: Level Up: Developing Developers - Melinda Seckington
Publication date: 2020-02-16
Playlist: You Got This! 2020 Conference
Description: 
	As video games have become more and more complex, game designers put way more time into creating environments where players are engaged and willing to put the time and effort into learning and mastering these skills.

We can learn a lot from how games are designed to make the internal developer experiences better, since it’s a similar type of environment we want to create: an environment where people can learn and master skills. We should make it easier for developers to understand what options are available to them, allow them to make time for learning and provide structures and processes for them to develop the skills that they want and need for future roles.

This talk will look at how you can help level up your team by using competencies and career development frameworks, what types of processes you can introduce to support personal development and how developers should be using opportunities like these to get a better understanding of what skills they should focus on.

Melinda Seckington is a Technical Manager at FutureLearn, the social learning platform offering free and paid-for online courses and degrees from leading universities and organisations worldwide. She speaks at international technology conferences and writes for MissGeeky, a blog about all things geeky and girly. When she’s not busy with events or blogging, you can find Melinda curled up on her couch with a good book or video game.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
I've pretty much always considered

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,130
myself a gamer I think I was about six

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,889
years old when I played my first video

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,440
game at a friend's house and I remember

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,719
being so so jealous that they got this

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,510
awesome device that they could play

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,050
whenever they wanted and a year later I

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,449
got one of these the Donkey Kong game

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,189
and watch so the controls on this were

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,650
fairly straightforward there was a

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,289
button on the right to jump up and down

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,050
and there was a pad on the left to go

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,969
left or right and you controlled Mario

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,950
from Super Mario Brothers and had to

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,489
avoid barrels that Donkey Kong this

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,760
giant monkey was throwing at you and it

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,340
wasn't much to learn about the game it

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,160
took a while to master and to score an

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,420
actual high-score but the rules of the

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,300
game were fairly simple now for our life

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,059
I've played a lot of games and as

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,190
technologies have evolved and graphics

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,850
have gotten better the games have become

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,130
more and more complex there are so many

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,920
games out there right now that require

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:15,659
you require you to actually put time and

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,000
effort into fully mastering the game so

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,220
my favorite example of this is horizon

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,250
zero dawn and in the game you need to

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,009
battle and hunt robot animals and it

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,200
starts off with these reasonable small

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,530
creatures that you can kill with a

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,240
single arrow shot but as the game goes

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:40,170
on the creatures become larger and

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,030
meaner and much trickier to kill and it

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,280
actually takes a lot of time before

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,159
you're able to take down the biggest

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,350
robots it's a game where you really need

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,360
to master two different weapons and

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,479
understand the different qualities of

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,579
the robots that you're hunting so as

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,950
games have got a more complex game

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,530
designers put way more time into

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,530
creating environments where players are

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,750
happy engaged and willing to put the

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,080
time and effort into learning and

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,230
mastering all these skills and I realize

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,040
it's not unlike the work that I do in

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,170
creating a Val

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,840
environments for developers where

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:22,319
they're happy engaged and willing to

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:26,189
learn and master the skills that they

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,269
will do so as mentioned in the intro I'm

00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:31,319
a engineering manager at futurelearn and

00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:34,200
we're a social learning platform

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,250
offering online courses programs and

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,620
greas so our company really cares about

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,819
learning and it shouldn't be a surprise

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,530
that that's reflected internally as well

00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,720
so I've been at this company for six and

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,959
a half years now and I joined a company

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,200
as an engineer but I've seen our tech

00:02:51,959 --> 00:03:01,170
team grow from a tiny team of six

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:03,629
engineers to 36 that we are today and as

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,139
a tech team part of our strategy is to

00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:09,569
grow our own software engineers so since

00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:11,849
our entire company is about learning we

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:14,670
believe that we should invest in our

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:17,340
people so impossible when we have the

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,590
capacity we should try to hire less

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,459
experienced people rather than hiring

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,840
only the most senior so for engineers it

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,489
doesn't mean though that we really need

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,389
to make sure that our team is constantly

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:32,190
capable of leveling up and having those

00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:36,209
processes and structures in place that

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,340
enable people to do that so the way I

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,530
see it is that as a manager I'm

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,230
responsible for the internal developer

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,139
experience so from the time a person

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,639
applies for a job with us to their own

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,489
boarding and it's our time at the

00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,260
company all the way to when they decided

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,329
to leave we need to make sure that

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,209
people have the best experience that

00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,000
they can have and I've been full-time

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,970
focused on this for two and a half three

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,980
years now and the more I do this the

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,879
more I realize that this is just another

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,340
variation of user experience so it's all

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,549
about understanding the motivations

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,349
emotions and behaviors of people and

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,709
providing the best experience that you

00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:21,989
can for them so I wanted to specifically

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,090
focus here on main user experience

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,710
because I think it's a very similar type

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,960
of environment that we're trying to

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,139
create so an environment where a peep

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,009
are engaged and focused on learning and

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:37,080
mastering specific skills so that's

00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:38,819
pretty much what the sulcus Mel I mean

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,699
looking at eight lessons that we can

00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:45,000
learn from game design and how we can

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,289
apply them to teams so one thing to note

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,569
here is I'm not talking about

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:51,240
gamification here so this is about

00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,910
making a time at a company more like a

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,470
game where you score points and is

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,960
leaderboard for a most kick-ass

00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,940
developer so it's not about anything

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,750
like that it's not about how we can game

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,449
my work it's about using analogies from

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:08,699
game user experience to better

00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,639
understand how we can make the developer

00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,570
experience better

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,759
so to structure this talk a bit more

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,060
I'll look at three different areas of

00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,520
game design and within this areas I'll

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,440
highlight different game examples what

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,349
lessons we can learn from them and how

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,569
to apply those lessons in in a team with

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:31,909
some practical examples of what my team

00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:34,979
does so a first area is starting again

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:37,470
so I mentioned an example earlier of the

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,919
donkey kong game where the controls are

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:43,710
purely left/right and jump so nowadays

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,509
games much more complex than that so

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,690
this is an overview of the game controls

00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:50,880
of uncharted and even though I've played

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,289
this game kind of overwhelmed by the

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,080
amount of things that you can actually

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:57,300
do but most games so today won't just

00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,570
drop you into the game and go right off

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,419
you go figure it out almost every game

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:06,389
nowadays has a phased introduction of

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:08,219
the various game mechanics so now I'm

00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:11,969
charted each of the controls get

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:15,240
introduced one at a time so in uncharted

00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:19,620
4 so when one of the first encounters is

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,229
with this random guy on the right where

00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,599
you learn how to punch you get this

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:28,380
little message telling you to hit square

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:30,509
to hit him later on you get another

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,120
scene where you learn how to interact

00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:35,250
with an object by pressing triangle and

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,169
eventually in similar ways you learn how

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:41,640
to dodge jump climb and shoot a gun

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:44,640
until you're able to do Oh

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,590
the base actions and in this game it's

00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,660
done fairly quickly within the first

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,270
half an hour you've pretty much learnt

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,820
the core mechanics but it's still staged

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,380
in such a way that you focus on one

00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,750
skill at a time so lesson number one is

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:03,090
don't overload new starters so when

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,450
someone new joins they've got a lot to

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,910
learn new people new ways of working new

00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,760
code base new terminology new

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,490
abbreviations so come up with a way to

00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,580
stage your onboarding and actually plan

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,380
it out more deliberately so the main

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,210
thing that we have is an onboarding

00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,450
checklist that we create for each

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,640
starter so we have an onboarding

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,070
templates in Trello which we regularly

00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,400
update and a week before a new starter

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:34,620
starts we create a copy and customize it

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,080
so it's all about allowing a new starter

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,360
to have one starting point where they

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,320
can find all the info that they need to

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,150
get started so going back to video games

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,520
another thing to note when starting a

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,400
new game is who is responsible for

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,840
teaching the new skills so a lot of the

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,660
early games would come with a manual

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,240
that exactly explains what each button

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,340
did and how the game works how you win

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,200
the game and I remember playing games

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,990
where I just kind of skinned him with

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,900
the manual just threw it away when I can

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,790
do this I'm smart and I Nonie discovered

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,630
that a certain move was possible like

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,650
mums so months later after actually

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:18,060
talking to a friend who had also played

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:22,380
it so at the time the onus was very much

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,330
on the player to figure it out so most

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,850
games out oh and bed that onboarding

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,360
aspects inserting the game is the one

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:32,850
responsible for teaching the new thing

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,700
so going back to uncharted it's just a

00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,640
simple hovering message but it is a

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,110
hovering message that won't disappear

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,680
until you've actually hit that button

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,930
so the aim itself goes right now it's

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,490
time to learn something we're not gonna

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,640
let you go on until you have actually

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,769
done that so lesson number two is

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,420
support and guide new starters

00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:57,519
so it's all well and good to have an

00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,559
onboarding plan and checklist but you

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,040
don't want your new starter to go at it

00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,959
completely alone so whenever someone you

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,449
start sweep air them up with a mentor

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,819
and the mentor is on their same team and

00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:11,889
sits close by to them and is there to

00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:14,139
help support and guide didn't you start

00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:16,119
ordering the first few pumps so they

00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:19,269
don't necessarily have to pair directly

00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:20,739
on the work together but the mentor is

00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:22,569
supposed to make sure that the new

00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:24,970
starter has something to work home and

00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:27,189
is around for any questions that they

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,980
might have and just generally should be

00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:32,079
the first points of contact that the new

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,699
starter can go to and we make sure that

00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,100
they regularly catch up and together

00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,600
come up with a plan for anything that

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,350
additionally needs to go into that

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,269
onboarding checklist so the second area

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,299
that we're going to look at is how games

00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:48,129
help with learning new skills so one of

00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:50,470
the most important aspects of learning

00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:53,439
something new it's understanding whether

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,639
or not what you're doing is the right or

00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:57,279
wrong way of doing it

00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,980
so typically games are pretty good at

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,420
providing feedback in some way and I

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,220
struggled actually we're coming up with

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,610
an example of a game that did it really

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,970
badly so going back to our target again

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,100
it's quite low key in this case

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:15,759
so once you've pressed the square button

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,769
that message just disappears and a lot

00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,869
of the other type of feedback in the

00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:22,929
game is the same type of feedback that's

00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:26,709
you'd expect so in real life so if you

00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:28,119
misjudge jump and missile edge you

00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:33,970
basically a fall to your death

00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:37,119
and so I kind of like real life I'm not

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,100
kind of actually real life don't jump

00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:42,639
like that anyway if you shoot at a

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,819
nominee he bleeds and then dice we might

00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:48,730
not really think of it as feedback but

00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:51,639
the game is actively telling you that's

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:55,389
an action that you did had an actual

00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:58,929
immediate effects so lesson number three

00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:02,499
is give people direct and timely

00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:04,749
feedback so impossible we want to

00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:07,230
encourage our team members to give each

00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:09,450
other direct and immediate feedback

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,060
especially when it's constructive

00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:15,410
feedback it needs to be delivered in a

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,780
timely manner and with specific examples

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,790
it's part of my role as a manager to

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,590
facilitate that this happens so one of

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,450
the things that I tend to do is just

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,030
making myself available for whenever

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,760
someone's - for whenever someone wants

00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:32,730
to prepare for a conversation with

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,600
someone else or wants to roleplay to

00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:38,040
trial out how to actually say stuff

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,470
because it's it's hard this type of

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,900
stuff I know two books that I found that

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:46,410
really help with getting people to think

00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,390
about feedback so the first is difficult

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,950
conversations which is all about

00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,290
approaching conversations and

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,150
structuring them better so the points

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,090
that you're trying to make just have a

00:11:54,150 --> 00:12:00,110
better impact and it's not just a useful

00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:03,390
book for difficult conversations any

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:07,230
conversations or communications that you

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,730
have will benefit from this so think

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,100
about the dialogue that you're having

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:14,040
with someone when you're pairing and

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:18,900
explicitly thinking about what impacts

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,460
your words have on the other person so

00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,160
the second book is from the same writers

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,750
and it's called thanks for the feedback

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,330
so it's written more from the point of

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:30,600
view of being able to hear and take in

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:34,020
feedback and understand what the various

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,800
triggers are that you might have making

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,810
you react to feedback so I forward I was

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,620
quite open and understanding about

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:45,960
receiving feedback and but when I read

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,290
this book I did it right before I was

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,420
getting my annual like review and I

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,430
noticed myself reacting and dismissing

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,740
some of the things and that people had

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,350
said in exactly the way the book said I

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,860
would so it's a really useful book to

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,840
get better at this type of stuff so

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,470
going back to uncharted at this stage of

00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,880
the game you normally also can't die

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,340
that guy on the right will just stand

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,820
there waiting for you to actually punch

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:20,360
him and you can't die from the punches

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:23,329
that he gives you back yeah anyway

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,910
so until you learn the game is set up to

00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:29,240
ease you into kind of learning and

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,459
applying these type of skills so another

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,670
example is Mass Effect where you can go

00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:37,610
to a shooting range to try out different

00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,410
weapons and powers without dealing with

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,140
any actual enemies shooting back at you

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:44,180
so again you can't die and allows you to

00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:47,810
trial out and learn how to master

00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:50,480
specific skills so lesson number four is

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:53,930
provide opportunities to apply new

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,940
skills so a future learn every person

00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:58,160
has a training budget which isn't

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,050
uncommon but we really trying to get

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,820
people thinking about how they'll use

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,060
their budget in a way that works for

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:08,000
them so while I love conferences I know

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,769
not everyone finds them as useful and I

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,750
also suspect that we encourage people to

00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:13,959
use their budget on conferences because

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,329
it's kind of the easy thing to do and

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,940
it's up to me as a manager to help

00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:22,640
identify what other types of training

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,130
are out there things like improv

00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,740
workshops writing or public speaking

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:30,649
courses getting a trainer in for a day

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,959
finding a mentor we need to be the ones

00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:37,070
to find and offer the opportunities that

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,180
people can use their budget on beyond

00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,310
that though we also make it explicit

00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:44,269
that people get personal development

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:46,279
time and during their normal workouts we

00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:48,680
make it a default that everyone on the

00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:52,269
team should be spending half a day per

00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:54,890
sprint on learning and developing you

00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:57,140
developing themselves so some people

00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,089
whiteman require more time other people

00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,220
less time but having that default

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:03,589
explicit means that we're setting that

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,190
expectation that people should be

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:08,540
learning and growing so one of the

00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,730
things that people can spend the time on

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,920
are our different learning events so

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,930
these are regular internal events that

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,670
are mostly self-organized for people to

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,130
get together and learn something in

00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,199
different ways and that's just a bunch

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,910
of the ones that we do and if you're

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,730
interested in this come and find me

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,130
during the break and then finally we

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,360
also have book clubs and course clubs so

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,779
for people who want to read a book or

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,160
take an online course and they may day

00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:35,690
meet up regularly to discuss

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,610
the progress that they're making and how

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,670
to apply what they've learned through

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:43,069
their work so the final area that we're

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,279
looking at is the actual leveling up of

00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:48,769
a character now not all games allow you

00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,529
to do this but there are a lot of

00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:53,779
role-playing action and even racing

00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:56,750
games nowadays that have some form of

00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:59,449
leveling in a little different ways that

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,269
games have implemented this ability to

00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:04,550
level up so in this section I really

00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,829
wanted to look at some of the variations

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:10,579
and the effect that they have on the

00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:14,029
player so the basic concept of leveling

00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:17,600
up is this your character starts at a

00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:20,149
specific level you gain experience by

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,620
doing things in the game like battling

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:26,089
enemies finding treasure stuff like that

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,730
so some games will call this experience

00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:31,790
points other skill points action points

00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,980
each game comes up with their own random

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,079
thing to call it but they all mean the

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,100
same thing it's a way to increase your

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:42,829
level now up until this stage I think

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,439
most games are quite consistent there

00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:47,269
are some exceptions but the majority of

00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:49,910
games were leveling up wolf or load this

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:52,490
type of pattern where their difference

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:55,610
is with what happens when you reach that

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,810
next level so the simplest version is

00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,000
where you reach the next level your

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:03,139
character becomes stronger in some

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,030
predefined set way so for instance in

00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:07,909
Kingdom Hearts which is a game where you

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:10,100
meet various Disney characters and Goofy

00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:12,169
and Donald Duck are your sidekicks each

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:16,130
level up is associated with a specific

00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:19,010
increase or ability so the picture in

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,559
the top right shows a message that Goofy

00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,589
is now level free and therefore his

00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:27,559
defense has increased so with level 4

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:30,860
his in his strength will increase well

00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:32,179
level 5 he unlocks a special ability so

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,690
no matter who you are where you're

00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:37,850
playing every person will get these

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,830
increases so in this type of leveling

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:43,250
with each level up you get a specific

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,870
increase that the game has preset but

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,240
it's a way to celebrate your character

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,429
getting stronger and progressing through

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,500
the game

00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:55,070
so lesson number five is acknowledge

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,290
people's growth so I'm always surprised

00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,570
to hear that there are still companies

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:02,540
out there where they're only give salary

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:05,420
increases if a person asks and lobbies

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,220
for themselves in my opinion you should

00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:11,059
start off with the assumption that your

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,470
engineers will learn and grow and you

00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,690
should be always taking the time to

00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:18,800
review and adjust their salaries

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:21,740
accordingly so we do salary reviews for

00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,880
every person every year most of the time

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,950
we'll at least try to give an

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,480
inflationary increase and then depending

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,059
on the person and the progress that

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,970
they've made they'll get a small medium

00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:33,770
or large increase and with each review

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,290
we also compare the salaries of the

00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:38,720
people in the team with comparable

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,520
skills and experience so it's making

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,340
sure that we're always being fair and

00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,230
consistent across the entire team so

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,240
none of this is dependent on how well

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:51,590
someone is able to advocate for

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,500
themselves so back to games and the next

00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:56,990
type of leveling up all allowed the

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,360
player a choice - what happens when they

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,770
level so in their first variation of

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,800
this the player gets to choose

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:07,340
themselves which stats or attributes to

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:10,250
increase so one example of this is Dark

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,980
Souls which is pictured so the values

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,230
here in blue are all the attributes that

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,809
the player can choose to invest in and

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,390
increase in these games it's really

00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:22,670
really important to know what each

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:27,380
attribute means how it affects you and

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:29,750
how you can apply it in the game so

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,000
lesson six is expose

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:35,240
basic competencies and what they're used

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,870
for so we've got several sets of

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,220
competencies based on what role you have

00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,200
so we started with the ones for software

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,290
engineers which are curiosity

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,929
communication technical skills teamwork

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,570
skills and initiative and we use these

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:52,730
whenever we're hiring and interviewing

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,950
to make sure that we're always taking

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,230
all of those areas into account and

00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:01,550
there were again consistent affair in

00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,910
how we're discussing people and then we

00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,120
um

00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,830
more advanced competencies for the more

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,540
experienced roles in the team and again

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,880
we can use these in conversations about

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:15,620
career progression during salary reviews

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,870
or when providing feedback having those

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,640
competencies means that we're framing

00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,970
those discussions with the attributes

00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,340
that we value and care about plus we

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,910
have a common agreed on language to

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,800
discuss these type of things so the next

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,710
way a character can level up is by

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,870
choosing a special ability rather than a

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,750
statue increase and this is where skill

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:41,450
trees and pathways appear in games so

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,740
this is horizon zero dawn again and at

00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,530
the start of the game you have the

00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,030
skills that are all in that first row

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:49,250
each time you level up you gain skill

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:52,130
points and you can exchange those points

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,350
to unlock whichever skill you will you

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,030
are bound to the order of the ones that

00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,770
are connected so you can't unlock

00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,890
something in the third row if you

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:03,260
haven't unlocked things in front of it

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:07,190
in D&O all the players end up with

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,750
unlocking everything in this tree it's

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,760
very much up to you to decide which

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,830
order you unlock them but you always end

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,100
up with everything if you stick with a

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,870
game so a similar example of this is the

00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,580
latest Tomb Raider so it's just a

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,890
different way of visualizing it but a

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,360
similar finger place you can only invest

00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,640
in the skills adjacent to the ones

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,040
already you already have and you end up

00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,190
with all of these skills at the end of

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:34,190
the game another approach is where it's

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,530
much more modular so this is Mass

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,840
Effect's Andromeda and in here

00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,670
you're never expected to unlock all

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,540
these skills there's just not enough

00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,120
points for it

00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,040
you can only invest in a certain number

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,260
of them and it's up to you to decide

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,510
what type of character you want to

00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,580
create and very much depends on your

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:55,970
style of playing what the right

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:58,300
decisions for you are a similar version

00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,770
of this is the latest Assassin's Creed

00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,930
and this I find really funny because

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,400
both me and my husband played this but

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:09,410
we have very different playing styles

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:11,630
and end up with very different skills to

00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,700
look so he wouldn't be able to play with

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,410
my character and I wouldn't be able to

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,290
play with his character

00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:22,130
is very much dependent on our own

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:26,720
gameplay so lesson number seven is allow

00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,860
people to choose their own path and what

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,900
I mean with that is allowing people to

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,480
generalize or specialize whichever way

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,940
they want so we used to have front and

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,610
back in the engineers but a few years

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:40,460
back we got rid of that title and turn

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,750
it into just software engineers we

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,700
notice that having those labels who are

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,130
creating unnecessary barriers and we

00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,510
didn't really acknowledge that different

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,640
the different types of skills that

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,400
people had that weren't covered by those

00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,740
two areas so rather than expect everyone

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,170
to be full-stack or that everyone fits

00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,450
nicely in a front-end or back-end box

00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,220
we're giving people the opportunity to

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,090
choose what skills they want to invest

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:07,160
in so we've recently introduced a DES

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,410
spreadsheet where people can say how

00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,900
comfortable they are in specific areas

00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:13,790
and we mainly use this for figuring out

00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,780
the makeup of teams and ensuring we

00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:19,520
balance the skills the right way and we

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,680
use it for people to find out who on the

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,630
team they should ask for help for when

00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,530
dealing with something so it's a way to

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:31,460
visualize all the different types of

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:33,680
experience that we actually have so

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,660
finally what all these games do are

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,480
visualizing and explaining how to

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,820
progress in the game they're all quite

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,340
different styles and there's quite a lot

00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,200
of complexity in each of them but all of

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,150
these accomplish getting to the player

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,580
familiar with what is possible and

00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:53,360
allowing them to compare and understand

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:55,910
what might be right for them so final

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,870
lesson is visualize what progression

00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:01,970
looks like so we introduced career

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,460
development framework last year career

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,890
progression framework I mean and it's

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,170
going through various iterations so the

00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,640
first one we had was very linear so

00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,190
similar to the first games that we

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,780
looked at where everyone expected was

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,360
expected to progress in a similar way

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:20,870
just one level at a time and eventually

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,730
unlocking everything we realized though

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,340
that that didn't really work for us and

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:28,130
decided to go for a much more modular

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,270
approach but I realize we really wanted

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,370
a link

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:35,000
the entire thing to our competencies and

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:37,160
to our different roles so this is an

00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,480
overview of our framework there's a lot

00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,130
going on in there

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,320
which I won't go into right now but

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,720
again if you're interested in this come

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,310
and find me during the break so the idea

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,640
of the progression framework is it's

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:51,380
really used to we use it as a tool to

00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,720
have those discussions about career

00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,820
progression with people and for people

00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,100
to plan and figure out what the next

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,650
should focus on in the same way that

00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:03,370
video games allow people to see where

00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:07,010
they are and what is possible for them

00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:09,350
so those are eight lessons of game

00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:11,240
design that we can apply to building

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:15,070
cultures where people are engaged and

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:19,220
motivated to learn progress and level up

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:22,400
so to recap don't overload new starters

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:25,370
support and guide new starters give

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,610
people direct timely feedback provide

00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:31,100
opportunities to apply new skills

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,890
acknowledge people's growth expose basic

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,710
competencies and how to use allow people

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:40,490
to choose their own path and visualize

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:44,780
what progression looks like so as a

00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:48,620
manager my main focus is in create sorry

00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,330
is in creating developer experiences so

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,150
I think in the busyness and heck cygnus

00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:55,820
of what managers do it's easy to lose

00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:58,580
sight that in a way our developers are

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,650
our stakeholders and we are the ones

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,110
that should be creating experiences for

00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:07,040
them that allowed them to grow progress

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:10,100
and level up so if your manager tried to

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,080
do this type of stuff if you're not it's

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,390
not unreasonable to ask your manager

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,970
where they can provide some of this

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,370
stuff so creating better developer

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,890
experiences are the way we can make not

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:24,740
only our company's better but also the

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:28,550
people that are in our teams trying to

00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:30,950
grow learn and progress so that's it

00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:33,010
thank you for listening

00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,010
