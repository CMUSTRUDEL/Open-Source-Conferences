Title: So good they can't ignore you! - Gargi Sharma
Publication date: 2020-02-16
Playlist: You Got This! 2020 Conference
Description: 
	You are good at your job, are polite and deadline oriented. Your long-term professional goals are well-defined, and you work toward them consistently.

But working hard is sometimes not enough. People around you need to see and value your work.

This talk will cover hard-work, visibility, the myth of meritocracy, and what we owe one another once we are “successful”.

Gargi is a systems engineer at Tarides, who really cares about building teams with psychological safety. Gargi is really passionate about teaching, systems programming and Modern Art. In the past, Gargi attended the Recurse Center, volunteered at AddisCoder, worked as a software engineer at Bloomberg LP, and wrote some code for the Linux Kernel.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,810
um hi everyone my name is Turkey and I'm

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,309
going to be talking about being so good

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,160
they can't ignore you

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:18,869
oh I kind of hate the title of the girls

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:22,760
songs finder she but the idea is how to

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:26,279
make your work visible the thing with

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,680
the idea is that if you do good work

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,160
then someone should take notice and

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,620
reward you accordingly to your work but

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,190
that's not how it works in real life

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,620
unfortunately and self-promotion is not

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,739
something that comes easy to most people

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,250
maybe because of cultural background or

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:50,430
the upbringing and it can be even

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,680
painful sometimes so what I want to do

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,620
in this talk is to give you a framework

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,859
so that you have it's less painful to

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,850
slash promote and brag and not undersell

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,369
yourself so the stock is going to be

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,729
divided into three structures the first

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:12,030
is my chakra see on the myth of

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,460
meritocracy the second is how do you

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,220
make your work visible and the last days

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,970
once you are successful how do you help

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,670
others and on you be successful if you

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,920
want to follow the skies for some reason

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,150
you have to think you can find the site

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:35,119
at this thing um yeah so under the first

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,680
part though so my talk Rafi

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,840
before we get into the myth of

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,670
meritocracy I would like to talk about

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,360
what my talk two seasons

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,460
so it's this belief that everyone has an

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,409
equal opportunity for success and

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,280
personal for based on personal

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:57,840
achievement and merit regardless of your

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,020
background or a you can't run and type

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,270
certainly intends to be a meritocracy

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,439
but we all know what road is paved with

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,829
good intentions

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,649
and it's first it's particularly hard

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,410
for people who like how shall have some

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,690
success or have achieved something in

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,900
to believe that it's anything anything

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,750
but a meritocracy because it's the

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,450
system that has awarded them right so if

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,930
they've got to read they've got to it

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:32,250
has to be because of their merit and not

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,640
anything else and the problem with

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,070
meritocracy is that the belief that

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,140
individuals could should be measured

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,900
Janan should be measured on the

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,300
intellectual output divorced of their

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,570
identity the gender unlike any other

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,660
distinguishing characters so the first

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,360
problem is that the assumption that

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,990
everyone has equal access to information

00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,050
is wrong because we all live in our

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,030
silos and if you were to live in one

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,560
choice a good area of the world you

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,230
might have access to more information

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,430
than the other drug for that area and

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,140
it's even the the thing is that who

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,640
you're not were just determines like

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,040
what information you're getting I

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,810
wouldn't be here if my network don't

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,460
tell me that there's a conference

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:27,870
hearing should apply and just not that

00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:30,420
the second part is that there are humans

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,690
working with other humans writing

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,530
software that benefit for the benefit of

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,840
humans so just another problem with the

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,440
already flawed notion of meritocracy is

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,720
that in the worth of an individual is

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,130
not measured by the humanity but the

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:53,209
intellectual output so my talk to see is

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,709
based on the few to utilitarian

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:58,230
utilitarian sense interpretation of the

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,410
word so utilitarianism is this

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,510
philosophy system which states that the

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,680
most moral option is the one which

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,090
maximizes utility so in the end the end

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,200
justifies the means

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:16,880
so one of the well-known problems with

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,770
adopting utility as a measure of

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,220
morality is that it ignores the concept

00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:26,180
of justice so as long as you're

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,180
maximizing output

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:33,180
think any of any bad actions you take

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,770
are justified because they contribute to

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,800
the greater good

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:42,539
so it objectifies people reducing them

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,520
to levels of tools and most cases is

00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,389
code for whatever delivers maximum

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,860
comfort

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:52,289
honestly speak for to other people

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:57,479
uh-huh so I'm the biggest paradox of my

00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:59,639
autocracy is I'm a mere Jake fear with

00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:03,449
their professor absolutely of Management

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:06,389
and the study where he studied 9,000

00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:09,689
people in an organization where there

00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:13,050
are HR practices like thank you a bonus

00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:19,889
for the performance and the whole spiel

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:23,849
is about rewarding of reward rewarding

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:28,259
Metacritic ideas and what the research

00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:32,240
found out was that women ethnic

00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:34,770
minorities and non-us baseborn employees

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,409
receive this morning to the increase in

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:40,289
compensation compared to for the right

00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:43,560
man despite having the same jobs working

00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:46,500
the same earth having the same manager

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,219
and most importantly having the same

00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,319
performance review score so the pilots

00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:55,830
of my Tata see both on the other

00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:59,159
research switches shows that people who

00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:01,830
believe they're the most objective can

00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:05,370
actually exhibit the most bias in their

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,889
evaluations and well this is kind of

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,729
disheartening I think the biggest

00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:13,949
takeaway that I have is nobody cares

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,589
about your work as much as you do and

00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,539
this is kind of the system we live in

00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:21,029
and we have to figure out how to

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,330
navigate this system so you can work it

00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:26,729
to our benefit and without me move to

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,229
the second part of the talk it shows how

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:32,729
to make your work possible

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:35,129
the idea is that whenever at some point

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:37,440
if York is at some point in your career

00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,629
you'll have to prove your value that you

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,980
belong here you're good at what you do

00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,720
but it can

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,810
hard to talk about your achievements

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,690
about underselling yourself or feeling

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,920
like you're bursting and that if you're

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,340
great at your job

00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,890
someone should automatically recognize

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,920
that the work you do the work you do

00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,190
unrewarded reward you with promotions or

00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,900
increase pay in practice it's like often

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,760
more complicated than that

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,160
there are some work which is more

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,290
visible and memorable than the others

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,620
and it's frustrating to have done

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:16,560
something that is what do you think is

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,540
really important but you later realize

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,700
you weren't rewarded for it because

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,670
someone thought someone who is making

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,530
the decisions Todd that didn't

00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,800
understand what you were doing or did

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,600
just didn't remember what you were doing

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,510
so the first part is building your

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,790
personal brand so you have a personal

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:41,010
gun regard yourself like whether you've

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:43,470
consciously chosen to cultivate it or or

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,690
or not like your personal violence

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,660
whatever people are saying well whenever

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,520
you're not in their new my personal

00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,260
brand instead I really care about open

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,300
source and people sometimes make fun of

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,680
it but I'm okay with that

00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,960
I can live with that oh so and your

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,720
personal platform is a top of your

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,640
personal brand is a passion for good so

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,420
your personal bond helps you realize

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:13,590
what values you identify with what are

00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:16,710
the things you care about and they help

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,690
others realize that if there's some some

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,550
task that needs to be done maybe you

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,660
care most about it because that's the

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,910
value system you identify with so to

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,120
build your own personal brand you need

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,400
to be clear about whatever because

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,500
you're trying to achieve you should be

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,340
confident in your abilities to achieve

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,890
those goals and see authentic in your

00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,650
options to achieve those goals and use

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:47,490
whatever your personal values that make

00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:50,540
you unique to achieve those goals

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,220
oh the other thing you could do is great

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:58,240
but an experience more for yourself so

00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:02,590
in in UX design whenever you want to get

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,340
from point A to point B in an app you go

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:08,230
through this experience map of getting

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,140
from point A to point B and that's

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:15,970
something you can do for yourself where

00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:18,280
you realize oh very you see say that if

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,620
you if you can't see like let's say a

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,780
junior developer and you want to be a

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,290
senior developer what should the

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:29,470
experience master that looks like and

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:31,090
it's a way to quickly identify like your

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,370
personal brand when you're working with

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:37,270
other people but these are the values

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:40,450
that you care about and the biggest

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:43,570
thing that you can do to make your work

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,400
visible is write a back doc so Julia

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,670
Evans has this great blog post about

00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:53,020
writing you back dog and what happens in

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:56,500
most places is that every six months or

00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:58,660
a year or a quarter you have to sit down

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,990
with your monitor and talk about what

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:05,290
you did for the last X months and then

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:07,810
what usually happens is like you go

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:10,180
scrambled up look at all the peers you

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,040
may think about oh this pier was useful

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:17,050
and maybe did something and the other

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:19,630
four across not so useful and and or not

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:22,870
and maybe I shouldn't talk about that

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:25,540
but what happens when you do that is a

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,760
lot of work that you did falls under the

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:31,720
radar because you didn't think it was

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,720
important enough and a plant dog is not

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,210
meant to be like a self-evaluation or

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,100
it's like a resume or a vision board

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,740
each of those have served their own

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,650
purpose but somewhat different instead

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:48,310
it's like a black dog is a living list

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,900
of all the achievements here time so the

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,520
one of the biggest things like you don't

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,030
remember all the cool things you did

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:58,300
maybe you wrote a test that you don't

00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:01,450
think is important but have helped

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:05,350
figure out an important important bug

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,209
later on but she didn't know about are

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,029
you nearby but forgot

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:12,759
because your peers don't show that or if

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,889
your manager doesn't your magis you

00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:17,079
won't have the best manager but they

00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:20,800
certainly don't remember all the cool

00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:23,230
things you did and writing a document

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,110
listing everything time of your cutoff

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:29,019
is an important reminder that can help

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,149
you during the South evil and what's

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:35,199
especially good about writing a black

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:39,059
dog is that whenever you have to update

00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:41,619
your experience math of of what your

00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:45,129
experience has looked like so far you

00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:47,259
can go look at your back dog go back and

00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:50,860
update your experience about every year

00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:55,569
or six months depending on what time

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:59,199
scary you choose and what time you add

00:11:55,569 --> 00:12:03,189
to your brought back dog it could be the

00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:05,709
purpose of forever to merge does not

00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,540
matter if the first Westhouse children's

00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:09,249
occurred or teen or hundred lines of

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,920
code as long as you're proud of it you

00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:13,809
should add it to your bright dog it

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,949
should it could be the design documents

00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:21,059
it contributed to or even maybe you did

00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:25,029
some discovery work to figure out that

00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:28,269
the service that you your team needs to

00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:30,730
do it has already been written by some

00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:34,899
other team and maybe you can collaborate

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,879
for them to to use their service the

00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,339
story works like this should also be

00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,350
included in your back dog and it could

00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:44,949
be a talk to you it could be a lightning

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:49,029
talk or an internal talk that you gave

00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:51,779
at your company and I would share about

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:53,980
doc comfort with you that can help you

00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:57,189
track your own back dog

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,619
so let down your ghost for the year like

00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:01,990
lift your major goes here and share them

00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,999
share them with your manager share them

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,699
with your co-workers and it's really

00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:08,860
nice because then they can see that's

00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:12,329
what's in their power to help you

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:16,059
achieve and accomplish those goals and

00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:19,149
your code right Adrienne code and untied

00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:20,450
contribution to to the project but when

00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:24,260
he add those

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:27,230
odd metrics if you can do that so let's

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:31,640
say if you're off if the code you wrote

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:35,750
helped speed up the service by experts

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,060
and add those numbers because you then

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:42,020
have solid data to back up what you're

00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:45,230
feeling and it doesn't have to be a

00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:49,130
numerical in fact maybe the thing you

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:54,100
wrote had GDP or for example maybe

00:13:49,130 --> 00:14:01,000
whatever you needed was important to to

00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:04,550
404 law law purposes I guess yeah and

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,560
our collaboration and muttering if

00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,430
you're a junior intern you can still

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,740
mine us

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:13,310
junior engineer you can still mentor a

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,680
lot of people oh there's us if someone

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,100
new is on your team you can have them on

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,200
board on to your team if there's an

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,140
intern on your team you can mentor the

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,150
intern and you just don't have to be a

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,640
mentor you can even be a connector if

00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,740
there's a new person on your team you

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,410
can introduce them to your network and

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,630
this should also be a part of your back

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,600
dock and collaboration where you

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,640
discovered like there's other kings

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,560
maybe there's someone on another team

00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,870
who wants to use your service and you

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:50,780
have done figured out how to use your

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:53,000
team's code and it doesn't have to be in

00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:56,840
the realm of your team it can be helping

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,480
the company so most places allow people

00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,240
after a year who've been there a year to

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,030
be in the interviewing pipeline so you

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,390
can work to ensure that the interview

00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,980
process is further or if you're in the

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,440
company you can figure it out

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:17,240
if you see that the performance reviews

00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:20,240
could be further and the biggest thing

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,870
in my opinion is what you are is

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,020
tracking what you learn because a lot of

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:30,920
times you have a lot of work that he

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,720
wrote that you are learning but it could

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,450
be that's what you're learning is not a

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,720
line

00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:39,450
to your goals so let's say I care a lot

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,190
about systems suffer and I want to write

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:43,920
more lower-level code but what's

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:46,080
happening is I'm learning a lot more

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,750
about benchmarking and testing and while

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,850
surely they're important things it's not

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,360
aligned to my goal of learning more

00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,640
about system software and this helps me

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,920
track down when that's not happening and

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,410
I can go back to my mantra and say in

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,590
the last three months what I worked on

00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:08,310
is not related to any of this and can we

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:10,560
change that I should include your

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,540
participation outside of work

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,160
so that could be contributing to an

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:18,120
open-source project you really care

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,310
about or a blog post that I wrote or I'm

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,820
a talker to meet up and one that you

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:26,880
gave and the most important part is

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,250
don't forget that invisible work so what

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,800
happens a lot of time is we do a lot of

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,320
fuzzy work which is hard to quantify it

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,840
could be like improving the code quality

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:42,600
or ensuring that the code review process

00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:45,090
is good and more in-depth and maybe it's

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,740
just refactoring so that in do you

00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:50,940
factoring so that the next person who

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:54,360
comes and adds code is it's less painful

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,620
for them but like this is the this is

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,020
the kind of work that's especially

00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,930
important to add to your dog because

00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,550
it's most likely to fall under the radar

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,860
so when you're doing this explain the

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,410
girls so if you for example if you were

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:11,210
going to refactor something statewide

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:14,010
you wanted to refactor this and then

00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,640
there's the things that you did to the

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,670
factory

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,120
it could be huge tests to ensure that

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,980
when you default it instant great or if

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,470
there were already tasks you ensured

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:30,030
that they were still working once you

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:32,940
refactor the code and then you can show

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:36,330
the visible effect that your refactoring

00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,370
had and the good thing about sharing

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:43,130
your back dog with your co-workers is

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:46,950
they can tell you and help you make this

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:50,100
impactful visible and

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,530
the thing is how to help others so in

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,020
general is just something if you're

00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,750
someone who really cares about your work

00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,990
then it's really positive to share your

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:03,360
goals and accomplishments and for sure

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,910
the things that haven't gone well eat

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,860
too and with your friends and co-workers

00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:12,720
because it feels then it feels more like

00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,490
less like you're working alone and more

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,470
like everyone's in it together and

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,710
you're helping each other get where you

00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:22,800
want so you can run a black document

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,600
workshop which is for the first part

00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,580
everyone writes their broad document and

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,160
for the second part you can pair up with

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:34,560
other people and help each other

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:37,010
brag more and this is something I'll do

00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,720
with my friends is we set up a call

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:42,720
bi-weekly or once a month to update or

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:48,810
blog dog it's especially helpful if you

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:52,560
have so my my my bag troop is mostly

00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:54,540
other china minorities and what I see in

00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:59,430
my friends is that be don't talk enough

00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:01,590
so we help each other back more and the

00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:07,890
big part is encourage each other to back

00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:10,290
more I yeah so what would I in my

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:13,860
opinion was so great about having a back

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:16,880
talk is that it lets you it lets it it's

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:20,010
that you find out now rather than later

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,860
that things are not going so great so

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,020
the first time I ever did a performance

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,170
review was like four months after I

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,970
started my first job which was weird

00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,300
because the times alone

00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:36,210
the times aligned that way but when I

00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:38,880
scrambled to find peers etcetera I lost

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:42,240
I did not put up a lot of things that I

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,170
should have and then I also realized

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,360
like I did learn a lot of things that I

00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:51,240
wanted to learn and that whatever I was

00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,160
working with was like very diverse or

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,710
diverged from what my goal was

00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,050
so having a black dog is a great way to

00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,680
immediately find out that things are not

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,490
going so well and maybe

00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,010
shall act on it the other part of being

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,040
reservoir and making your work possible

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,450
it's not working as much as I hate to

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,450
say it as an introvert

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:16,270
it's it's very important because you can

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:20,290
have your personal brand but if you're

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:22,330
not showing up to places nobody knows

00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,820
about your personal bond and you're not

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,830
telling your own story and getting out

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,870
of your comfort zone and not working

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:32,410
ensures that you can create new and

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:34,770
exciting opportunities for yourself so I

00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:37,870
have some networking hacks as an enjoyed

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:42,490
mostly for interest I hope they will

00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:45,970
help other people too so one is having a

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:51,700
blog or a micro blog on my trip dog is

00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:54,040
hint-hint twitter so having this ensures

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,980
that you can take your time and think

00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,680
about things and formulate your thoughts

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:03,070
and then talk in th and go dialogue with

00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,500
others this one is my favorite it's

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:08,590
become a connector if you work for a big

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,630
company you can I work for like a tiny

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,660
person's turn up so I already know

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,760
everyone I mean who do I connect to but

00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,220
if you work for a bigger company you can

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,960
be a connector which is every week or

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,540
every two weeks get a lunch or coffee

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,370
with someone doesn't have to be someone

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,530
in engineering could be someone in sales

00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:29,110
and marketing and that's a great way to

00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:33,310
explain about the bigger picture that

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:38,310
your company is trying to solve and like

00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:41,500
not be siloed into your tech bubble and

00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:44,830
and you can be indispensable because

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,930
then you know more unlike have less are

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,850
not knowledge gaps than other people

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:55,780
because you have talked to people who

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:58,240
work in different areas of your job the

00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,990
third is a heart which is very stressful

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,050
you speak of it around so the good for

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:07,300
your body is that you already spent so

00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,640
much time thinking about what you're

00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:12,340
going to talk about but when people come

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,970
up to you PAP

00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:18,340
they come up to you and you can already

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:22,659
talk about what you talked about so

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:26,289
that's that's stressful heart butter hot

00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:28,390
mandala before is organized a

00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:32,950
comparative wheeler low effort around

00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:35,320
which I used to run a book club which

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,240
was very low for effort because you only

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,279
have to read a book and people will show

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,260
up and you can talk about the book and

00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,659
it's a great way to meet new people and

00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:47,649
still be talking about the book not

00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:50,789
other things which is nice and the last

00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:53,919
is if you do I know about a big around

00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:56,409
one of the hearts I've talked to young

00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,279
people before leaving so if I'm sure I

00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,549
will

00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:03,220
my end is usually less than three but I

00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:07,779
was talked to three people three new

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:10,330
people and then and then be like okay

00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:17,380
like I have no more formal and I'll be

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:20,429
out of here was the pizza yeah those are

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:24,250
my facts one of the pitfalls gods of

00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:27,029
that happens with junior engineers

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,730
especially if you work

00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:31,809
Tonya Riley has a really trade it's

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,370
incredible

00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:36,640
talk about to work it's in my it's in my

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,850
references

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,100
but to work is essentially the

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,590
non-technical aspects of your job

00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,059
so look establishing according Stein

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,429
there's like you can be a junior

00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:51,520
engineer and you could get a lot about

00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:53,890
code reviews and ensure and like work a

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,960
large to ensure that like nope request

00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,080
gets motion without a code review or

00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,630
like at least two people have to agree

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,669
before merging a product class or stop

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,520
or setting up collaboration with other

00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:09,010
teens on a lot of these fall upon your

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,710
shoulders because they are part of your

00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,600
personal bond and your values and it's

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:22,330
something that you really do you really

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:25,940
care about but so bad documents are also

00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:28,340
a way to help you track this but you

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,350
doing too much glue work and maybe you

00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,200
should talk to your manager to ensure

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,659
that more glue work doesn't fall on your

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,950
shoulders

00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:42,440
so don't visions of yourself and last

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:45,470
part of my talking is what we owe to and

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,000
and other ones were successful success

00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,049
can have different definitions for

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,549
different people

00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:54,500
but once you figured out how to make

00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:57,259
your with workers abode in your

00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:01,399
organization help other folks around you

00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:04,639
pay it forward and a lot of times the

00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:08,000
competition we see is artificial

00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:10,399
competition that is much more throat and

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,279
much more opportunity outside the career

00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:15,139
ladders that we see and if you think

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,500
about those opportunities you make more

00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:20,870
progress and feel more progress and

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,519
better yet you'll find ways and

00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:31,360
opportunities to partner with people

00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:35,120
within your organization to motion flood

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,889
social mental first it could be a junior

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,559
engineer it could be someone starting

00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:42,169
out but you have lessons that you've

00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:45,440
learned that you can teach others or

00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:46,070
hide those around you we're all in this

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,580
together

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:52,929
we only came back more maybe not all we

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:56,299
most people certainly need to beg more

00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:59,120
and John you can run a backup workshop

00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:00,679
help other people back home and you can

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,840
started networking around so it could be

00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:07,779
something right looky-loo efforts like a

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,779
