Title: Unions Got This - Organising the Tech Trade - Dan Parkes
Publication date: 2020-02-16
Playlist: You Got This! 2020 Conference
Description: 
	Unions don’t usually come up in history class. If they do, they’re normally accompanied by talk of miners and Thatcherism. But we’re not taught what unions actually do for the modern, nine-to-five worker. That’s where this talk comes in.

This will be a whistle-stop tour of what unionism means in today’s world of tech. We’ll briefly cover what a union is, the various shapes and sizes they take and what they can do for you, using the recently formed Game Workers Unite UK branch of the IWGB as an example.

We’ll also touch upon the happenings across the pond at Kickstarter and Vox Media as well as how the international movements of Game Workers Unite and the Tech Workers Coalition are bringing unionism into tech industries.

Dan is the Chair of the West Midlands Regional Group of Game Workers Unite UK. He’s also an Audio Engineer at Pixel Toys and has worked in the games industry for 6 years across audio, data and design disciplines.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,230
it's how we all doing great my name's

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:14,280
Dan I am an audio engineer by day and a

00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:19,350
organizer by night this is about unions

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,000
so the first off start off what are

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,890
unions so I want to know how many people

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,650
here know what a union is raise your

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:31,019
hand okay that's good so for those of

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,399
you who don't know we're not talking

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:39,719
about set theory yes I did do a matter

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,550
degree I was not very good but this bit

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,350
I knew we're not talking about set

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:49,649
theory we're talking about trade unions

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:52,289
and so traders and kind of any kind of

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,969
work and ultimately what unions are

00:00:52,289 --> 00:01:00,710
about about rights so the rights we have

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,030
in our daily lives a lot of us

00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,210
especially at this stage in our careers

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:10,590
when we were new we maybe don't know

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,350
what our workers rights are and you you

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,330
aren't to know because we're not taught

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,580
that we're not when when you go to study

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,890
at university chances are it may have

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,740
had one lecture probably wasn't you were

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,500
like I could skip that one not important

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:30,509
now it's very important and it's

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:33,540
something that is very tied to - it's

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,000
tied to something that we don't really

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,939
think about because chances are we won't

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,600
need to because companies will say and

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:45,259
this is where I I'd like to thank Kezia

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:49,520
the first talk was perfect as like a

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:52,920
launchpad into this talk because

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,070
companies although they're offering you

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,790
an opportunity they're ultimately trying

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,579
to use you for their gain and this is

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:07,229
where you have to look out for yourself

00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:08,130
with your workers rights so companies

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,800
are capped

00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,600
they're gonna try and use you use your

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,890
value

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,140
Nathaniel earlier was talking about

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,110
value and the value that they're putting

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,660
into you that value is that's that's

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,940
what the company cares about it's not

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,850
necessarily you and that's why you have

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,370
to look out for yourself and you're not

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,040
alone because you work at that company

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,410
with other people and those workers if

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,380
you combine together that's when you get

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,330
unions some big wall of text you're not

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,820
meant to do this in presentations just

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,370
to if you're ever going to do it but the

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,560
big things here well that unions are

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,300
meant to represent workers and employees

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,900
and big companies and small companies

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,120
any size of company but it's ultimately

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,670
representing the employees versus the

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,810
employer and these are some of the

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:04,380
things that they can can do for you so

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,500
if you have a union you can get engaged

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:12,209
with some kind of democracy democracy is

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,580
fun when it works so you can practice a

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,239
little bit actually working in the union

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,400
where you can vote on things and you go

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,019
like votes for yay nay and it sounds

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,640
it's like you're actually in Parliament

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,970
it's fun

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,640
the but you would elect workplace reps

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,130
and branch offices so I'm a I'm an

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,310
officer of the Union the game workers

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:39,330
unite UK Union for the West Midlands

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:42,930
region so our our region here and I was

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:47,880
elected by people in my region to

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:50,880
represent our region and here is some

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:55,200
examples of things that unions in the

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,480
past have done for their workers they

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,290
have made sure that these these things

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,290
are part of your daily lives part of

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,570
your working lives and some of them a

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,790
lot of these you might think are taken

00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,690
for granted they're not sometimes

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:15,959
employers will try and slip slip you by

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:18,329
try and get get one on you because you

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,459
know because probably because you're new

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,519
and you don't really know you maybe

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,139
don't know your workers

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,860
they probably they think you're in a

00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,870
union because the tech industry where

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,150
we're not particularly well unionized at

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,819
the moment so they're in we're in

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,509
particular we're particularly vulnerable

00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:39,460
to this kind of thing and then if you're

00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,720
really thinking about what's in it for

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,539
me huh

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,900
I want to what's in it for me they like

00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:51,130
the every Union in the UK will provide

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:53,889
you with legal support in cases so you

00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,620
can if someone if you're getting

00:04:53,889 --> 00:05:00,400
discriminated at work for any any

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,830
legitimate reason you should and you're

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,090
part of a member of a union you can talk

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,190
to your union and they would be like

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,900
that's out of order and then they'll

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,729
come in and you can sue your company and

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,659
then you have a case and then and then

00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:19,120
then you get some money which is great

00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:19,930
yeah so if that's sounding great where

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,599
do I start

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,539
if you if you those of you who didn't

00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:28,030
know about unions earlier the best

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:30,789
starting point is probably for the UK

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,900
the miners strike if you haven't if you

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,690
don't know what that is

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,919
some good like starting points are Billy

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,990
Elliot either the show either the the

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,449
film or the musical the musicals

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,169
probably better in my opinion we have

00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:49,449
Tom Holland because of it so and and

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:54,219
pride which is a wonderful film about

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:57,069
how LGBT people supported the miners

00:05:54,219 --> 00:06:01,810
strike it's all about Maggie Thatcher

00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:04,840
and that yes yes thank you

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:08,219
love those boobs there's going to be a

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:12,340
few of these these are called QR codes

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:15,729
that they're very rarely used they're

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,979
quite useful but that is a QR code for

00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:22,060
the link on the left if you want to have

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:24,310
if you want to read up on on labor and

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,460
the complications between employers and

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:30,520
employees and power dynamics and work

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,750
and and seeing them in films this this

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,960
website is really good it has a good

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,710
list of films that can help you get into

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,070
this

00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:43,070
so if you some example unions that we

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,840
have here in the UK we've got I'm just

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,640
going to name a few out from on here so

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,440
we've got the National Union of

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,620
Journalists which is for journalists we

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,100
have the Musicians Union for musicians

00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:02,150
the Communications Workers Union the CWU

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:05,240
there for the Royal Mail and if you if

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,680
you follow follow unions in any way you

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,040
will have seen that they've been having

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,730
some big strikes and proposing to strike

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,190
and and the Royal mouths refusing for

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:20,240
them to strike and it's quite there

00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:22,880
they're one of the biggest vocational

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,130
based unions in the UK and I would

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,370
highly recommend if you interested in

00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,990
how big unions can get CWU is a good

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,990
union to have a look at and they're very

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,420
active they're really strong very

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:40,490
inspirational and then you've got equity

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,990
for actors and performers and then we've

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,770
got on the right hand side we've got

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:48,440
unison and unite so these are two really

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,620
big unions they're massive and they

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:55,010
represent all sorts of workers from

00:07:51,620 --> 00:08:00,050
various different industries and another

00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:03,740
such union is back to so some of you are

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:07,310
just going to do another quick query how

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:11,270
many of you are actually in a union ok

00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:17,120
that's good yay how many of you are with

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:19,730
Beck - one person two people ok so you

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,420
know about back to everyone else so back

00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:28,760
to is for broadcasting entertainment

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:31,700
communication and theatre Union and they

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,450
have a small little game sector but the

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,370
thing about some big Union right back -

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,080
because they're known as service unions

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,500
or business unions which means that they

00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,600
have the structure much like any like

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,060
many big organizations like companies

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,030
where you have bureaucracy and so you

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,730
have levels

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,490
to that and that that can be good it

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,800
means that it's quite efficient and

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,290
well-run but it does mean that it is

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,740
maybe less radical it's not going to

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:05,980
create large changes to an industry and

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:09,310
especially a broad union like Beck - is

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,720
going to be looking after various

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,570
different avenues so they haven't

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,020
necessarily got they're not tailored to

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:20,380
a specific industry whereas if we look

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,760
at a union like iw GB which has been

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,520
coming up in the news a lot recently

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,740
they'd like to make a lot of noise

00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,310
it's the independent workers of Great

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,350
Britain I won't go into why it's called

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:36,160
independent workers because it's a very

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,150
long story but basically the independent

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,070
doesn't mean self-employed it just means

00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:45,100
it's from the history of from which the

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,360
Union came and it focuses on industries

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,740
that haven't traditionally been

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:53,920
unionized so we've got branches for

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:58,420
social care workers cleaners delivery

00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,700
riders uber drivers all of these all of

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,880
these workers are separate branches of

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,640
the iw DB and the thing about iw DB is

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,700
its lightweight and it's got a flat

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,030
structure as opposed to higher - as

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,490
opposed to a hierarchy which is the way

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:20,080
I kind of used it is it's kind of like a

00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:22,990
bootstrap for unions so it's like ah

00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,080
what what's the very minimal you want

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,510
and IWD be offers that which is

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,380
basically legal support and a very

00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:35,980
strong commute kind of press team who

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:41,590
are very have very active and get news

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:45,760
out very quickly so one such bit of news

00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:49,840
is very recent a couple of days ago we

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:53,950
just well we've had this case iiw DB

00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:58,300
with against the police because James

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:59,760
Farah in the top left a tot your top

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,329
right

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,810
he was prosecuted by the police for

00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,750
assault

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,850
he used the megaphone he didn't whack

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:12,449
someone around the head with it he just

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:15,149
was using it and the police were trying

00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:16,920
to accuse him of assault

00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:17,610
luckily the judge thought that was

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:24,420
bollocks

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:28,410
so threw that out so now we're IWT B and

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:32,430
James are trying to sue the police and

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:35,579
another QR code there and link to that

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,949
and you you will see slides available I

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,139
think later so you can follow that

00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:42,540
through but that's a that gives you a

00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:46,949
bit more information on that and this

00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,870
but this also is the in order to sue the

00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:50,399
government they're going to need a bit

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,980
of funds because it's lightweight

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,800
because it's quite radical they're not a

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,070
big Union with big unions have to have

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,709
big pots of money that they're very much

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:04,110
in the same kind of kettle of fish as

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:06,329
kind of nonprofits charity where they

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,940
need to do a lot of fundraising so if

00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:11,190
you have got if you think that our right

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,260
to protest should be defended and you've

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,870
got a spare five pounds you should

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:20,699
definitely maybe pop that into the pot

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:23,160
so iw GB leads us into game workers

00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:27,420
unite UK so game workers unite UK is a

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:30,420
branch of IWGP and as as using the

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:33,000
bootstrap that iwg be is we were like oh

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,730
that sounds nice we'll use that and then

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,480
we've created our own Union which is

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:42,269
game workers in unite UK branch of iw GB

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,459
and it's rank-and-file unionism where we

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:46,500
all we're all equal no one has more

00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,709
power than anyone else but all everybody

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:53,540
is as an equal vote and an equal voice

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:55,620
the only issue the only things that

00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,269
where there are positions there's

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,610
responsibility but that doesn't

00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:01,699
necessarily mean you have power it that

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,440
there there is obviously power in

00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:07,350
someone who calls himself a chair sounds

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,870
important so you're like oh I'm the

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,600
chair and

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:16,009
[Music]

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,720
other than that there is no power and we

00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:20,029
are in we are autonomous so we run

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,160
ourselves we're all volunteers we all do

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:24,860
it off that off our backs because we

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,889
want to change the industry in fact what

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,529
we want to do are four things that we

00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:33,290
all came together when we form the form

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:35,660
the union and we were like things are

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,870
bad in the games industry we want to

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,699
change things in four key areas so we

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,019
want to end this thing called crunch I'm

00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:44,389
sure you've heard of it

00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:48,500
I was just talk to Ruth before I came on

00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:51,079
stage about a cyberpunk 2077 you may

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,180
have seen that they've delayed it not

00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,639
because they've wanted to not let their

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,779
workers not crunch they're still going

00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,769
to crunch in fact they're going to do

00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:04,639
more crunch this is exactly what we want

00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:07,699
to stop and buy that's why we perform

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,970
this union primarily but we also want to

00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:13,250
improve diversity inclusion efforts

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:17,870
across the across the UK because it's

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:20,209
incredibly CIS white I mean I'm case in

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:26,209
point but I hope I'm trying to change

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:27,829
that I'm the idea it's not great and we

00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:30,230
need to do better and we want to work

00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:34,060
with with all sorts of people in the

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,620
games industry to improve representation

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,839
we also want to support people who have

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,689
been abused this is an area that we're

00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:45,079
very proud that we've we've won lots of

00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:48,290
cases for our members so even we've been

00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:51,709
going just over a year and we've we've

00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:54,110
helped people who've had harassment and

00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:56,569
discrimination at lower workplaces and

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,750
we've get we've helped those people in

00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:02,870
cases and then finally we want to try

00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:05,360
and create security because when a game

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,959
is when a game is being developed

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,120
there's bugs and people have to find

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,639
those bugs those QA there's wonderful QA

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,410
people often are on zero hour contracts

00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:20,089
so we want to try and solve that as well

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:24,670
and some other examples of where you

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,670
where organizing is happening Riot Games

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:30,829
over in LA there you might know them

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,250
from league of legends but they've been

00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:37,399
in the news a lot in the last couple of

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:39,440
years because they have a they have an

00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,040
inherent sexist culture that was exposed

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,490
through Kotaku and then some female

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,670
employees sued right and then their

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:52,639
walkouts and this was a great example of

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:55,430
organizing and it's crucial to state

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,190
that they haven't got a union yet so

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:02,410
organizing doesn't require unions unions

00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:05,569
are ultimately a product from organizing

00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,269
and that's why I want you to take that

00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:13,180
in because the tech industry hasn't

00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:18,910
really got any specific unions yet

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:21,230
another example is this is a great video

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,389
I'm just going to leave the QR code

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:29,389
there and you can find it later or you

00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:33,649
can google or go it I'm divorcing myself

00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:37,850
on Google PMG is people make games that

00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:40,310
sort of YouTube series by Chris brat who

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,160
used to work Eurogamer and it talks it's

00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:46,069
a great example of what unionism looks

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,089
like because it's Blizzard we're trying

00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:53,120
to fire a hundred and something people

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:56,300
in France and then hire them again for

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,300
cheaper in Ireland and this video goes

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,670
into all the all of the issues with that

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,179
and how the unions France has got a

00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,900
great history of unionism I don't know

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:08,510
if that's a word

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,699
unions there so if you want to go and

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:14,929
look into that I highly recommend

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:17,929
watching this video but a lot of you

00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:20,089
okay another raise of hands I'm enjoying

00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:26,089
seeing the hands who here works in video

00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:29,150
games hi Beck Beck came with me so none

00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:31,970
of you work in video games which is fine

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,190
because it's not just as I was saying

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,799
it's not just video games this in fact

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,030
should bleed out into other areas and

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:45,870
we've been seeing walk outside goo

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:50,530
and in fact just last November for

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:53,140
employers were fired and they think it

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:56,230
was for organizing efforts so those two

00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,750
provide some context those employees

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:02,380
working at Google and then might be

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:05,290
saying might be trying to get some union

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,330
or organizing efforts happening at the

00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:11,590
workplace may be organizing meetups

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:13,870
outside of work and then Google it's

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,730
possible they might have used some some

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:19,740
documents documents to share round

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:22,600
things and then Google fired them and

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:30,340
that is something called union busting

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:32,710
the union busting sucks and so this is

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,470
something we want to make sure is is

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:41,110
quashed a lot and so that's where we're

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:43,210
going to see in America Code CWA and and

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,520
going to see hopefully those Google

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,910
employees and other people in tech and

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:53,620
games because what what in America you

00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:56,919
can see is there being a kind of The

00:18:53,620 --> 00:19:00,100
Sisterhood of tech and games coming

00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,559
together to form a branch of the Union

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:07,450
which is CWA over in America to create

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,230
code CWA AOC tweeted about it which is

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,250
awesome

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:16,210
and you can that this is an example of

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:18,910
what hopefully tech organizing in the UK

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,490
might look like so that brings me nicely

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,850
onto the tech workers coalition who here

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,860
has heard of the tech workers coalition

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:30,179
few people okay that's great because

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:33,190
that means the rest of you this is new

00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:36,910
the tech workers coalition is ultimately

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,740
a movement very similar to how so game

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,660
workers unite UK as a union but was

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,940
formed out of an international movement

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,160
called game workers unite which was not

00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,530
a union but is an effort to create

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,600
organizing and hopefully unions and

00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,070
various places around the world and tech

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,900
workers coalition is trying to do

00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,840
exactly the same

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,740
trying to get people at workplaces to

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,500
talk to each other about organizing and

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,180
and put those people together and they

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,380
have a great website that I'd highly

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,440
recommend you checking out and I've got

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:11,530
a link later so I'm going to quickly go

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,990
over reasons why organizing is good and

00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,510
what I hope that some of you today will

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:20,500
go away go to tech workers coalition

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:22,390
website and join the slack and take part

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,080
of the conversation it's a great way to

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:29,680
meet new people and and create safe

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,890
spaces if you haven't heard the term

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,590
safe space yet it's something that is

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:38,110
becoming more common in in workplaces

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,090
and outside of workplaces it's the idea

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,670
of trying to create places with good

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,590
codes of conduct such as this event that

00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,340
you're here today I would regard this as

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,810
a very good safe space for people to

00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:53,140
feel like they can come here without

00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:55,900
being harassed or or discriminated

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,720
against and you can you could you could

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:02,290
organize similar meetups in your in your

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,260
hometowns and find a pub use a free

00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:09,760
service like a vamp right or there are

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:12,730
other services available but and also I

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,730
highly recommend try to keep it dry like

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:19,720
this event as well where because there's

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:23,800
a growing trend that alcohol is just not

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:27,100
great in in social meetups it's nicer to

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,380
use other methods to comfort people do

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,000
some ice breaking you could use those

00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,630
tips that Matthew had earlier they're

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,110
great but it's about meeting new people

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,660
and meeting new people together to to

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,640
learn about something that a lot of us

00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,430
really don't I didn't know anything

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,240
about unions two years ago and Here I am

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:52,450
today it's about you could learn about

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,840
the history of unions in our country and

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,090
in Europe you would also it's a great

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,650
stepping stone into other areas of

00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:06,190
activism so I'm sure you've seen all the

00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:07,090
stuff about extension rebellion if you

00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,120
were ever

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,680
interested in trying to do some climate

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,410
change activism this is a perfect

00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,680
stepping stone in fact one of our one of

00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:19,900
the previous members of the exec for our

00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,360
hour of union at gaymerx unite UK now

00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:25,680
does environmental climate change

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:29,470
activism and similarly I was very

00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:32,490
invested in this election more them I

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:34,810
have before and that I think was down to

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:38,500
unionism because I now feel more

00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:41,050
passionate about improving the life of

00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,850
everybody and it's a great way to learn

00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:45,610
new skills that you probably can't get

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,620
elsewhere it's not you can learn some of

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,380
these skills at work of interpersonal

00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,810
communication skills but there's also a

00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,570
lot of learning workers rights and

00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,850
learning something that is is very

00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:01,600
different to our very technical

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:04,360
expertise being in an environment which

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:09,030
is divorced from that is a is a great

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:14,260
way to learn new skills I'm doing great

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:16,780
it's also incredibly rewarding because

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:20,260
as I said earlier the Union that I

00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:23,140
helped form has changed lives it's

00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,780
helped people who have had who are worse

00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,850
off full and this is another reason why

00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,220
maybe you should join a union is because

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,590
if you're if you feel pretty good I'm

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,120
feeling pretty great my life's pretty

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,350
good there are people out there who

00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,570
aren't who are in worse positions and

00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:44,460
especially in unions such as the IWGP

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:48,820
who represent cleaners immigrants who

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:51,790
come very soon don't know if they'll be

00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:54,640
in the country or not so that is

00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:57,190
something that as part of the Union

00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,240
which is representing those people I

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:04,150
feel like I'm I'm helping in a way and

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,250
if I wanted to if I wanted to step up

00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:09,010
even more they would give me plenty of

00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:12,010
opportunities to do so and it's every

00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:14,740
single time I have done anything for the

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:17,080
Union it's incredibly rewarding you

00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:21,170
inspire others and also constantly are

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,690
inspired and you do feel like

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:27,560
you are maybe changing the world which

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:30,530
is nice to feel so this is the website

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,150
you should check out there are meetings

00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:34,820
in London there is a tech workers

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:39,110
coalition London already so if you're

00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:43,790
london-based that exists if you're not I

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:46,880
would love for you to maybe maybe

00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,830
well definitely join the slack and then

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,420
maybe set up a meeting here in

00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,070
Birmingham if you're based in Birmingham

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,980
or wherever you're from set up a little

00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:58,520
meeting can be just in the pub set up a

00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,140

00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,020

everything you've heard today creating a

00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,010
space to talk about all of the things

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,200
you've heard about today like the the

00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,660
brag Doc's all of these things would be

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,510
perfect to be discussed in such an

00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:20,570
environment but also with your fellow

00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:24,310
