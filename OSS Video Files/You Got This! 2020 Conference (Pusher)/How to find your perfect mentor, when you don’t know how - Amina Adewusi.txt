Title: How to find your perfect mentor, when you don’t know how - Amina Adewusi
Publication date: 2020-02-16
Playlist: You Got This! 2020 Conference
Description: 
	Achieving your goals, whether to teach yourself how to code, get your first developer job or level up in your career are very likely to require support from a mentor.

Identifying and connecting with good mentors ensures that the time you spend trying to achieve your goals is both efficient and effective. Mentors can open doors to more knowledge, job opportunities and support you mentally and emotionally.

In this talk, we will cover exactly what you should say when reaching out to someone you don’t know, whether in-person or online. We will explore how to interact with your mentor to understand and meet their needs, so that you can create a sustainable symbiotic relationship.

Amina is an Associate Software Engineer at the Guardian News & Media in London. She taught herself how to code whilst looking after a young baby and juggling a full-time job. She is passionate about encouraging under-represented groups into tech and is proof that it’s possible to become an engineer without spending a penny. She is an international speaker who seeks to represent the voice of new developers in the software engineering industry.

	00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:10,500
good morning everyone hi it's great to

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:13,650
be here my name is Amina I feel really

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,870
passionate about you got this I was here

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,859
at last year's conference sitting where

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,710
you are I actually came with my husband

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,779
and my son who was one at the time I

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,820
wasn't organized to buy tickets

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,250
organized enough to buy tickets for them

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,410
so we just rocked off and weren't really

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,140
sure that we'd be allowed in but I was

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,920
so bowled over when the person at the

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,450
Welcome Desk so kindly welcomed as and

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,010
said yeah of course you should all come

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:47,520
and so I feel this is a conference where

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:49,559
they really put people first and I love

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,079
that we have this conference in the UK

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,090
for early career developers so thank you

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,449
very much to everyone who put together

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:03,239
[Laughter]

00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:06,750
so at last year's conference I had been

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,439
coding for a couple of months since then

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,590
a lot has changed for me I continue

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,020
teaching myself how to code I got my

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,930
first software engineering job and I

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,360
work at the Guardian as an associate

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,560
software engineer on their digital

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,920
fellowship program I was lucky to

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,759
receive a lot of support on my coding

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:37,320
journey from many many developers who

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,400
acted as mentors for me this meant that

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,320
I was able to teach myself how to code I

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,270
didn't have to spend a penny and I

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,360
managed to do this whilst working full

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,509
time and with my care responsibilities I

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,079
went back through all of the messages

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,049
that I had exchanged with developers

00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:02,399
whilst teaching myself how to code and I

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:06,750
counted exchanges with 60 developers who

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:10,229
helped me some of those people gave me

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,330
one code review some answered a few

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:17,610
questions over the phone

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:23,060
a few paired with me every week when I

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,060
look back I feel exceptionally lucky

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:31,200
upon further reflection however I have

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:36,240
to admit that not one of those 60

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:40,290
developers came to me I have never

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,260
received an email saying hey Amina I

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:49,640
heard you need some help when are you

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:54,930
free I have to initiate all of those

00:02:49,640 --> 00:03:00,000
relationships I had to reach out I had

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:03,570
to ask for help you can create your own

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,870
luck on your coding journey and I want

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,760
to show you how it can be difficult to

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:14,370
define mentoring I see it as a learning

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,920
relationship usually between someone

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,820
with more experience in the area that

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,920
you want to learn about but I think

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,170
there are so many different types of

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,480
mentoring and I really believe that you

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:33,390
can create whatever works best for you

00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:36,930
personally I've used mentors for two

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:41,340
main things the first is technical help

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:44,430
and the second career advice so I've had

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,400
mentors that I've paired with who have

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:52,350
given me code reviews or who have just

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,720
answered a technical question I've also

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:58,380
had mentors who have looked over my CV

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,040
and cover letter who coached me on how

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:07,530
to get a job and importantly motivated

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:11,850
me when I felt down incidentally the

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:14,489
title of this talk is a misnomer you're

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:17,130
unlikely to have one mentor who would

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,750
meet all of your needs and in fact I

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:24,690
advocate having several mentors I'm

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,090
often taken aback by how advice can

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,720
differ

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:31,240
so much from person to person and I

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,320
found that by speaking to several people

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,690
I get a richer experience seeking

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,680
mentorship generally means that we have

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:44,530
some sort of goal and I think getting

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,580
specific about this goal is really

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:51,639
really helpful for example instead of

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,949
saying I want to learn how to code we

00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,130
could say I want to learn this language

00:04:53,949 --> 00:05:00,330
or framework to build this project or to

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:03,850
complete this kind of technical test

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:07,000
getting specific can help us consider

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:12,030
where best to find ideal mentors and

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,650
helps us craft a clear call-to-action I

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:20,860
made a big mistake with this last year

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:23,620
around this time last year my goal was

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,500
to learn how to code or at least I

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,330
thought it was so when I approached

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,840
people asking for help

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:35,110
I got responses like have you built this

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:40,150
kind of application or let's build this

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:43,450
together it was only a few months later

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:46,450
that I realized my goal was actually to

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,090
get a job as a software engineer which

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:53,590
required a completely different set of

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:55,270
actions on my part when I started

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,750
learning about the job application

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:01,240
process I was surprised to realize that

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,940
the learning I had been doing had not

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,639
prepared me to pass a technical test

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,700
which was often needed before I could

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:14,560
even speak to an engineer let alone

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:17,830
interview for a job once I realized this

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:23,039
I completely pivoted my learning plan

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:26,380
and focused solely on technical tests

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,169
upon reflection I would have saved a

00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:34,090
considerable amount of time had I done

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:37,190
the two following things I wish I had

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:41,069
spent more time introspecting

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:43,800
asking myself what do I really want to

00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:47,819
achieve what would make me happy and

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,490
what's most important to me the second

00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,289
thing I would have done differently is I

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:56,550
would have spent more time researching

00:06:52,289 --> 00:07:00,539
what getting a job involves there are so

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,639
many blog posts online so it wouldn't

00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,949
have taken me long to realize that I

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,440
needed to develop a certain skill set to

00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:12,690
reach my goal doing these two things

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,610
introspecting and researching wouldn't

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:19,410
have taken me long and it could have

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:23,009
saved me months what I've learnt from

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,919
this is that the answers we get from our

00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:30,330
mentors are only as good as the

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:34,409
questions we ask asking the right

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:38,940
question can save us time money and a

00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:42,509
lot of energy and motivation so we've

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:46,919
got our potential goal how do we

00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:49,199
initiate contact with a mentor I'm going

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,900
to run through some of the different

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,500
online and in-person platforms that we

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,349
can consider I'll note why each platform

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:03,330
is particularly good to use and how I

00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:07,289
think we can use it the first is open

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:09,870
source if you have a technical goal that

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:13,889
you're seeking help on this could be a

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:16,830
great channel you may be able to work on

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:19,800
a code base that has actual users in a

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:23,250
team of developers following a normal

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,740
development process this is likely to

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,020
give us a more realistic experience of

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,690
what a typical developer would do day to

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:35,159
day rather than completing a side

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:38,279
project the best open source communities

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,289
will give you code reviews they may have

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:44,270
chat rooms where you can seek further

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:47,310
help and find someone to pair with it

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,660
can take time to find the right

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,940
community for you

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,640
I love github at

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,620
search feature where you can search by

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,580
language and even get really specific

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,680
and search by the number of close PRS in

00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:07,110
a certain time period to see how active

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,450
the repo is once you find a few repos

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,610
that you like and you've tried out you

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,400
could try reaching out to the most

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:18,240
active contributors see if they're

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,700
willing to help being an active

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,590
contributor can be time-consuming so

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,280
they might not be available but they

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:29,490
might know someone who is I did just

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,070
this when I was struggling to install a

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,140
new open source project and ended up

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:39,750
powering with that person on a weekly

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:41,760
basis I hypothesized that a lot of open

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,700
source contributors will be doing this

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,990
work in their free time

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,960
therefore this makes for a really

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:51,420
compelling set of potential Mentors

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,390
they're already using their personal

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,460
time to code and it might not be such of

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,040
an ask for them to share their screen

00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:04,380
and pair with someone instead of just

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:08,240
coding alone the next channel is slack

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:11,250
or similar public chat rooms like git er

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,560
we've got a number of meetups here in

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,410
the UK established to help people learn

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,500
how to code and some of them have active

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:23,250
public chat groups you can join these

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:26,910
even if you can't attend in person code

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,710
bar is a fantastic example of an active

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,870
slack group where people can receive

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:35,970
code reviews and get answers to their

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:37,860
technical questions I find this channel

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,130
particularly good for ring-fence

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,020
technical questions you might see a

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,540
pattern in who's responding to your

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,210
questions which explanations you

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,160
understand the best you could reach out

00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,950
to those people directly and ask

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,839
additional questions I used to do this

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,850
and receive remote pairing which was

00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,350
really useful the next one is LinkedIn

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:04,410
some people see LinkedIn as

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,009
unfashionable I love the way Dov

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:14,639
I use LinkedIn please do not contact me

00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:18,350
I am NOT looking for a job however there

00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,879
are some developers who might use it

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,370
certain groups who are likely to use it

00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,019
include those who are early in their

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,360
career maybe they've only recently found

00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,370
their first job or perhaps developers

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,589
who work for larger enterprises if

00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:35,339
you're targeting a certain group

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:37,290
LinkedIn can be quite useful it's also

00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,259
really good for people like me who had

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,670
absolutely no industry experience and

00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,810
are starting to make those first

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:47,250
connections you've got 140 characters

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,740
when you're trying to connect with

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:53,850
someone it's not much so it's really

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:56,220
important to be concise I try and point

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,649
out something that I admire about the

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,819
person's profile or a blog post they

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:06,029
written I also have a sentence about why

00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:08,459
my own story is compelling for example

00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:11,339
you could be a musician who's teaching

00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:12,839
yourself to code or you can talk about a

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:17,459
website that you just built in your

00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:20,819
spare time I would then always have a

00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:22,949
very clear call to action such as would

00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:25,380
you have 10 minutes to speak on the

00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:28,439
phone about your experience at this

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,139
company or this bootcamp I would also

00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:35,009
give an alternative like or I'd be happy

00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,839
to receive messages via email a clear

00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:40,019
call-to-action helps our reader

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:44,490
understand what we're asking for and why

00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:47,850
they should connect with us let's move

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,220
on to Twitter Twitter is fantastic for

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,290
getting to know our industry you can

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,809
research popular influencers and

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:57,959
hashtags and gain an understanding of

00:12:54,809 --> 00:13:01,110
current issues we have some really

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,269
inspiring developers who actually use

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,730
their popularity on Twitter to help

00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:08,639
others by asking people to apply to

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,939
their tweets about new jobs or people

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,800
who are available to help others there

00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:15,170
are a number of those people in this

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,060
room right now

00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:20,670
I've used Twitter to ask for conference

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,250
buddies or help submitting a Tech Talk

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:25,590
for a certain conference for these

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,110
specific calls to action where you can

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,940
tag a person or an organization who will

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:34,500
retweet to a wider audience

00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:38,820
this can be perfect so what about

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,980
in-person platforms if you have the good

00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,200
fortune to be able to attend an

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,270
in-person meet up or coding workshop

00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,240
this can be the perfect place to find

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,190
mentors as volunteers are already likely

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,560
to be very passionate and enthusiastic

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:57,990
about helping others in such meetups I

00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,820
would usually ask volunteers if they

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,730
wouldn't mind answering my extra

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:06,930
questions or helping me get unstuck on a

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:09,570
personal project I would ask if I could

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,760
connect with them online and even if

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,320
they couldn't help me themselves I would

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,860
always ask if there was someone else

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,220
they could put me in touch with

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:22,950
conferences can be game-changers at the

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,440
end of last year I watched my friend get

00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:28,650
a job at a conference that neither of us

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,350
would have otherwise known about I found

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:34,830
great mentors and very very close

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:37,020
friends through conferences however this

00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,510
comes with the caveat that there are so

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:43,500
many different types of conference so I

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,420
advise researching before committing you

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,860
could ask people at a local meetup if

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,360
they've attended this conference and

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:54,000
what the experience was like for them

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,440
did they feel welcome were they able to

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,940
initiate conversation easily with others

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,830
you could try asking conference

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:04,290
organizers for a conference buddy

00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:07,890
or just reach out on Twitter as we've

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:10,380
described nevertheless at any conference

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,890
it can be very hard to go up to people

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:17,010
you don't know some of the easier

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:19,080
moments are before or after a talk when

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:21,690
you're sitting next to someone or you're

00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,300
in the lunch queue you could try saying

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,490
hi or taking up one of Matthew's tips

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,180
find out how their finding the

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,899
conference why they've come

00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:33,730
and what interests them I have had a

00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,980
couple of instances where people haven't

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,980
wanted to speak to me and I think that's

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,170
totally fine too if people don't feel

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,779
like talking you could try approaching

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:46,510
and the speakers who might be more open

00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,010
to this and asking if there's only one

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:54,130
they know who they could put me in touch

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:58,200
with so we've spoken about online and

00:15:54,130 --> 00:16:00,700
in-person platforms tips on initiating

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,930
relationships and conversations with

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:07,540
people who might be able to support you

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,730
when I reflect on my journey and I

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,790
realized that a lot of my relationships

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:15,190
came from different platforms so it

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:18,880
might be worth not just focusing on one

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,740
but trying a few I also noticed that

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,470
these relationships were created over a

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,200
period of time I don't think they

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:28,660
necessarily happen overnight for me I

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,950
got my most active mentors over a period

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:35,200
of six months or so there are a few

00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:40,240
platform agnostic things we can consider

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:42,700
when seeking mentors first I think it's

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,820
important to say that we should always

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:49,510
respect people's boundaries it's also

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,890
vital to stay safe online especially

00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:57,010
when reaching out to people that we

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:59,950
don't know creating a compelling story

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:03,850
and understanding your why is

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:07,600
advantageous why are you learning how to

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,900
code why are you seeking a job as a

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,870
software engineer most of us have a

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,319
number of demands on our time so being

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:20,559
able to express your why might make your

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:25,689
message stand out and be more attractive

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:29,050
to a potential mentor we also really

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,780
need to do our research it's better to

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,460
read someone's blog articles before

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:38,860
asking a question they've already

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:40,899
answered elsewhere let's have a really

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,899
clear call to

00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:46,779
you could offer that somebody responds

00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:49,360
to your and questions by email or ask

00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:52,360
for a 10-minute call this was really

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,470
useful for me when I first thought about

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,549
coding

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,740
I had a hypothesis that I would enjoy

00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:02,470
being a software engineer and I wanted

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,149
to design a few tests that would help me

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,200
ascertain whether that hypothesis was

00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,169
true or not

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,029
and I reached out to a number of

00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:13,360
developers on LinkedIn asking for

00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:15,340
10-minute calls and I was so bowled over

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,370
when people would respond sometimes

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,230
within minutes being willing being

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,360
willing to give their time over the

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,850
phone and these 10-minute calls would

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,389
often run into thirty minutes and and

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,760
over an hour so I do think that people

00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:34,480
really are very willing to give their

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,580
time in this way I've also found it

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,720
really useful to implement a testing

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:44,019
phase after asking for a defined action

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,870
you could assess if this person gives

00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:48,610
you helpful explanations if you feel

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,399
like you can communicate easily with

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:54,399
them do they keep - you're agreed

00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:57,190
meeting time by asking for a small

00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:58,990
action you can test if this is someone

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:05,350
you would like to keep seeking support

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:07,690
from I also like to ask for referrals if

00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,909
the person you've reached out to can't

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:14,110
help is there someone else they could

00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:16,870
put you in touch with social network

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:20,710
research has shown that creating

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:23,860
relationships with someone you know via

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,809
someone else or have met randomly with

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,789
little overlap and your current network

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:34,029
can be incredibly valuable these people

00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:37,750
were called weak tie contacts by Mark

00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:41,289
Granovetter in 1973 because there's

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:44,220
minimal duplication in network weak tie

00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:48,639
contacts tend to know people and

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:51,760
information that we don't they might

00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:52,900
approach life differently there might be

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,410
little trust

00:19:52,900 --> 00:20:01,950
between you but they can bring new

00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:05,050
information new ideas and contacts to us

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,960
asking for referrals allows us to make

00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:09,970
those weak tie connections and access

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:16,000
completely new networks and

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:19,540
opportunities there are so many people

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,480
out there willing to help if we get an O

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:25,300
from one person we can learn from that

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,760
experience but we don't need to let that

00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:32,160
D motivate us from reaching out to

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:35,560
others we've spoken about initiating

00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:40,090
relationships how do we know to great

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,930
ones first i want to talk about marshall

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:45,040
rosenberg's

00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:49,120
non-violent communication iraq and his

00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,640
work around communicating needs it would

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,040
be very wrong to assume that the

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,090
mentoring relationship is only about the

00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:01,000
mentees needs it's very much about the

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,370
mentors needs as well and this follows

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,570
my premise that mentoring is hugely

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:10,000
beneficial to Mentors

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:12,610
how can we find out what our mentors

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,890
needs are and how does this help us

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:20,950
create a more symbiotic relationship to

00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,770
understand the needs of our mentor we

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:26,380
could ask something like I'm really

00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:29,680
inspired by how you give your time to

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:34,510
help others what motivates you to do

00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:38,290
this when I've asked this question I've

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:41,340
received varying responses all of which

00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:44,680
gave me some insight into my mentors

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:49,780
motivations and some clue as to how I

00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:51,850
could meet their needs for example one

00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:55,360
of my mentors said that he actually

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:59,170
considered teaching as a career but

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,900
decided to be an engineer instead he

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:05,920
loves the process of helping someone

00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,860
learn a new concept this is useful

00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,919
infamy

00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:13,760
for me because it means that mastering

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:16,250
complex technical concepts is likely to

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:21,529
be something he would enjoy helping me

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:24,019
with what are some of the other things

00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:27,500
that have proved successful for me

00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:31,360
personally and importantly how can you

00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,360
learn from the mistakes that I've made

00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:37,460
first

00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:41,179
I rarely expressly ask someone to be my

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:44,450
mentor instead I have often found that

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:46,970
the relationship emerges organically by

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:51,710
both parties committing to speaking or

00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:54,230
meeting regularly when having a call or

00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,929
a meet-up with a mentor I've always

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,929
tried to be prepared with an agenda take

00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:03,080
notes of any actions and to complete

00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:05,600
them when agreed I found that this is a

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,710
way of respecting and being caring

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,590
towards this person preparing I often

00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:15,289
describe the task or send the github

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,320
issue I want to cover in advance and

00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:20,750
I'll ask for any reading or concepts

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,380
that I can read about before the pairing

00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,970
session again after pairing I like to

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,289
ask for feedback on where I can spend

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:33,130
more time on practicing I have made a

00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:35,539
number of mistakes I have over committed

00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:39,230
to actions that were unreal it

00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:42,320
unrealistic for me and to complete in

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,600
the allotted time frame when learning

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,899
how to code especially when juggling all

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,600
of life's other tasks more likely to

00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:52,760
have other priorities so it's really

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,429
helpful to be clear and transparent

00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:01,190
transparent about what's realistic for

00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:03,320
us a painful mistake I've made is not

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:07,429
requesting the easiest technical

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:12,169
solutions sometimes seasoned developers

00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:13,940
can forget that were beginner and will

00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:16,370
receive a solution that they're most

00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,380
excited about that is really fashionable

00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:22,190
or just the shiniest new toy

00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:25,040
they can find now I prefer to ask for

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:27,860
the easiest option so that I don't feel

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:33,680
demotivated by how hard it is to

00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:36,470
implement something more difficult also

00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,890
I want us to feel empowered to end

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:42,350
mentoring relationships they might no

00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:45,050
longer be working for us or maybe we've

00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:48,500
already achieved our goal for example

00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:51,410
when I got my first job I decided that I

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,940
didn't need to work on code in my

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:57,440
personal time anymore

00:24:52,940 --> 00:25:00,140
I made the mistake that I wasn't so

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,230
clear about that to my existing mentors

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,910
I would have liked to more transparent

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:08,660
least tell them this

00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:11,600
I would suggest graduating active

00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:14,150
mentors into more passive ones whereby

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,070
you ask for help on an ad-hoc basis

00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:19,660
instead of necessarily coding on a

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:23,540
weekly basis if you were to conclude

00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:29,330
overall I believe that there are many

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:32,830
people waiting to help you in this talk

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:37,670
we've discussed assessing your goals

00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:41,470
getting specific we've looked at a bunch

00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:44,180
of different platforms that you can use

00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:48,140
we've talked about some generic tips

00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:50,420
like storytelling creating rapport and

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:54,950
creating a clear call to action as well

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:57,500
as having a testing phase we looked at

00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:00,260
nurturing these relationships by

00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,960
considering our mentors needs making

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,580
best use of their time preparing for

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,660
meetings and action inappropriately

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:11,570
afterwards we also looked at Network

00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,490
research in how meeting people outside

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:19,780
of our network can bring us new

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:23,900
information and opportunity sometimes

00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:28,760
learning how to code can be tough I know

00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:31,160
I've been there I want you to know that

00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:37,190
there are many people out there

00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:40,630
to help you create your own luck start

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:43,780
initiating mentoring relationships today

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,780
