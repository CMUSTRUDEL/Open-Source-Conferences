Title: Learning to Invest in Your Future - Matthew Gilliard
Publication date: 2020-02-16
Playlist: You Got This! 2020 Conference
Description: 
	When change is the only constant, learning is the only future-proof skill. But deadlines, rules and the pressure to ship working code can stop us from learning effectively. To do that we need to give ourselves permission to switch mindset; to try new things, to have fun and to embrace our curiosity.

In this talk, using examples from the pioneers of programming education in the 1960s through to the present day, Matthew will show some effective techniques for developing new programming skills. You’ll see how learning how to learn can benefit you through your whole career, and how valuable it can be to share what you’ve learned with others. As well as making your programming more fun and more interesting, you’ll find out how cultivating your learning can benefit your employer and set you up for success.

Matthew is a Developer Evangelist for Twilio, a company that is helping developers to fuel the future of communication with APIs. He loves spending time with the programming community at conferences, meetups and hackathons, helping developers to discover their superpowers.

hello everyone so thank you cuz I have

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,450
four that great talk I thought was

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,250
wonderful so I don't know about you but

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,360
when I was at school I studied a whole

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,930
bunch of different things like maths

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,880
geography what Nate what what have you

00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,460
but I never was taught the skill of

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,740
learning I was expected maybe to kind of

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,990
already know it or pick it up as I was

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,359
going along and this talk learning to

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,759
invest in your future is about the why

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,790
and how of focusing on learning as a

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,430
specific skill independent of the things

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,489
in technology and software or other

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:44,370
things that you want to learn so it's

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,690
true I am a math scheduler actually I'm

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,430
old enough that there wasn't a

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,489
department of computer science when I

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,680
was at university and I'm also old

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,059
enough to have an 8 year old son and he

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,980
when I was talking to him about this

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,449
talk this week he said he's really

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,390
looking forward to when he grows up and

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,520
can finish school because then he won't

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,990
have to learn anything ever again

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,990
I did not break the news to him but

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:15,080
that's not how it's gonna turn here we

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:18,240
are five percent already through 2020

00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,680
I'm as as at the beginning of every year

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,200
it's like a great opportunity to look

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,490
forward and think about what you're

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,290
going to achieve that year and like

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,360
every year in my career so far I'm

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,299
excited by it but also intimidated

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,280
because I know full well that I'm going

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,020
to spend a lot of this year doing things

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,210
that I don't really know how to do very

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,189
well I'm going to be doing things that

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,990
I've never done before and it is

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:46,380
genuinely exciting but also intimidating

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:48,210
so I'd like to tell the story of some

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,829
people who set out to do something very

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,729
difficult that had never been done

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,490
before starting 58 years ago twenty

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,649
twenty fifty

00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,320
this chap John F Kennedy was president

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,509
of the United States and here is at Rice

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,479
University announcing that there will be

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,890
a manned mission to the moon taking a

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,830
human to the surface of the Moon and

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,830
bringing them back safely it's kind of

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,340
interesting too I heard a great

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,520
a story recently about how he came to

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,550
decide to do that the fact is that at

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,820
the time the USSR was winning the space

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,770
race they had put a artificial satellite

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,200
in space Sputnik right

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,410
they put a dog in space because that's

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,200
the thing and they put a person in space

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,520
and brought them back alive Yuri Gagarin

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,230
and they'd done all those things before

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:45,600
the u.s. heard NASA was a few years old

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,540
and one of the senior figures in that at

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,140
that time was Verner von Braun who had

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,209
been Nazi and moved secretly to America

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,650
after the Second World War his

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,570
suggestion was that the mooned mission

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,330
should be done because it was so

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,160
difficult so ambitious that it basically

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,530
leveled the playing field between the

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,390
u.s. and the USSR there was so much of

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,970
an advancement in the in what would need

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:13,170
to be done that need that neither

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,060
country had a big advantage so JFK

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,060
publicly announced by the end of the

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,680
decade they would have achieved this and

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,110
he set a monumental engineering

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,850
challenge but also a huge learning

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,850
challenge these people were going to be

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,360
building new things enormous new things

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,790
and huge quantities of new things they

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,380
were going to be using new tools and the

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,610
new tools some of the things that they

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,550
used as their new tools were things that

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:41,370
they'd had to build and they were going

00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,110
to be working in new environments and I

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,430
choose to believe that this isn't a

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,700
Hollywood backlot this is the new

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,260
environment of the moon a lot of things

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,920
have never been tested in that

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,090
environment

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,470
well nothing had ever been tested in

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,290
that environment but even in space

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,870
everything was rather new so it's

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:02,400
interesting to think about who NASA

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,470
chose to to achieve this this is the

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,709
Apollo 11 mission control room with

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:11,340
famous photograph with one female person

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,780
right in the center and Jerry Griffin is

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,870
one of the flight directors of this

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,090
mission and he said in an interview the

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,820
average age of people in this room is 27

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,770
years old they hired people straight

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,490
from college based on written

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,050
applications no interviews

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,370
put them straight to work and then they

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,979
found the place where they could work

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,139
effectively a quote from Gerry Griffin

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,630
this task had never been done but they

00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,880
weren't afraid of it it was a lack of

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,349
fear it wasn't a lack of knowing that it

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,810
was risky but they just weren't afraid

00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:44,300
of it they didn't have any problem of

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:49,160
washing away old experiences that didn't

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,750
apply anymore one particular person who

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,419
I'd like to bring to your attention is

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,650
this fella his name's Steve bales he's

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,020
the guidance officer so his

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,270
responsibility is understanding and

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,550
interpreting the output of the computer

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,820
that's in the lunar module as it's

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:09,080
descending to the surface of the Moon

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:12,139
and he if you've ever seen a movie about

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,840
about the moon landing I'm sure that the

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,370
infamous 1202 computer error

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,960
featured in it five miles from the

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,389
Earth's surface the computer started

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,820
throwing this 1202 error they all had

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:25,130
numeric codes and it's up to this guy

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,599
Steve bales to work out what that means

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,960
and whether they need to abort the

00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:29,870
mission

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,840
Steve bells didn't know the answer he

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,620
had a deputy Jack Garmin who did know

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,139
the answer

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,110
Steve bales is 26 at this point in time

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:41,180
Jack Garmin 23 and between them in 15

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,969
seconds they came to the conclusion that

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,009
the 1202 error was probably all right as

00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:52,099
long as it didn't happen too often which

00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:57,250
is which is a yeah a debugging technique

00:05:52,099 --> 00:06:02,030
I still use 58 years on it's worked well

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:05,509
so building new things using new tools

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:07,940
in new environments is exactly the daily

00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:11,479
reality for people who work in software

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,889
there's no escaping it I that's like the

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,539
biggest example I could think of the

00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:16,909
doing that but for anyone who works with

00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:19,340
software this is what happens what you

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,509
do every day the pace of change in

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,430
software is ludicrous

00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,320
we're building new things every problem

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,669
is at least subtly different if it

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,280
wasn't we just used the thing that

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:30,680
solved the pre-existing problem we're

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,050
using new tools languages frameworks

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,349
libraries editors shells operating

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,490
systems etc you can't know them all

00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:39,630
right so at some

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,370
you're going to have to be picking up

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,009
new ones and we're working in new

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,979
environments AWS this year is going to

00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:49,110
be 14 years old and they've been

00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:51,949
releasing new services at a rate of more

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,210
than one a month on average since 2006

00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:55,680
there's no there's no I don't believe

00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:01,440
there's a person on earth who knows all

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,660
of them and even in AWS and that's only

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,680
one platform you've you're always you

00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,960
know whenever you push your code

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,430
somewhere it's going to be using some

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,479
platform feature or some framework

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:15,780
feature that's new to you so constantly

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,699
constantly learning as we go and how do

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,770
we learn like how do we learn anything

00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,750
not just software talk about playing a

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,090
musical instrument or learning to swim

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,039
well or something like that

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,860
any kind of skill you want to learn is

00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,860
learn through practice doing a thing

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,840
over and over until you're good at it so

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,030
doing a thing over and over until you're

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,389
good at it there's no escaping the fact

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,470
that if that's what practice is then at

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,849
least at the start you're doing the

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,460
thing over and over without being good

00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:46,680
at it there's going to be mistakes

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,979
there's gonna be missteps things aren't

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,469
always going to work out correctly as

00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,479
you want them to first time and I almost

00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:57,630
said it there it's tempting to think of

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,400
those things as failures but if you keep

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,710
learning as an explicit goal in your

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:06,599
mind then they're not failures they're

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:09,120
great successes so the thing you need to

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,520
do in order to learn effectively accept

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,530
these mistakes find or create a safe

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,620
space where mistakes are okay where

00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,630
things don't have to work first time if

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,060
all you ever do is write code that

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:24,240
pushes it sorry is pushed straight to

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,560
production then that might be very

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,530
exciting but it's not a great learning

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,110
environment and once you've found or

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,270
created your safe space and have sort of

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,240
pre forgiven yourself for not being

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:39,029
perfect you can even start to enjoy the

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,370
mistakes and sort of relish them here's

00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:44,310
a still from a video from SpaceX they're

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:47,730
learning how to land Rockets on a boat

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:49,709
in the middle of the ocean and they they

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,940
put these videos out of all the things

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:51,630
that have gone wrong and they celebrate

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,340
it and I think

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,800
a really wonderfully kind of healthy

00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,330
attitude because if they already knew

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,710
how to do it and they were confident it

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,510
was going to work and then this this

00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,310
happened it would be not so great a

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,480
result but they explicitly setting out

00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:09,990
with the goal of learning so talking

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,230
about stepping outside of your comfort

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,300
zone there's a quote if you never push

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,360
yourself beyond your comfort zone you

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,580
will never improve that quote comes from

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,610
a person whose office organization

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:27,990
skills I greatly admire his name's

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:30,480
Anders Ericsson and he's a an

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,450
educational psychologist in the 1980s he

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,850
studied the differences in how people

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,510
practice between high achievers in lots

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,460
of fields academic athletics music and

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,320
other people who don't perform so highly

00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,970
and he found that obviously there's an

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,860
amount of practice and a motivation to

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,250
practice but also the type of things

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,750
people who are very high achievers do

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,640
when they're practicing is qualitatively

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,440
different to just doing the same thing

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,190
over and over and hoping to get better

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,740
at it and so I think it might be known

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,860
rather well nowadays but he coined this

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,900
phrase deliberate practice which

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,060
describes the process of deconstructing

00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,280
a skill to the point where the

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,880
individual elements can be practiced in

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,450
isolation so let's say for example I

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,810
want to sell socks online I'm going to

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,190
build a website to do it well I might

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,900
need to deconstruct that I need to learn

00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,370
how to build some front end I need to

00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,770
learn maybe some server-side and some

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,240
database or data store technology you

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,920
can deconstruct each of those things

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,370
further I might need to know about query

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,860
planning HTTP caching CSS specificity

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,840
rules each of these things can be

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,640
practiced in isolation and then when I

00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,250
come and put them back together for a

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,690
stop shop online v2 it's gonna be that

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,160
much better that much more performant

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,150
cheaper to run and make me more money

00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,830
selling socks

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:54,510
I talked right now about how learning to

00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,060
do something or skills acquisition as

00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:01,110
it's sometimes called is treated and

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:04,710
modeled there are several models of how

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,490
people acquire new skills this is one I

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,649
particularly

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,260
like but there there there's a slide at

00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:14,910
the end with a link to references with a

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:18,209
bunch more in in the case of me learning

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,709
react when I remember that react exists

00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:23,040
and it's a thing that can help me build

00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:24,810
webpages then I start to understand it

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,940
by copying and pasting code following

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,790
tutorials and then I can get to apply

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:35,450
that knowledge by using reacting my own

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:37,770
new websites after that comes a phase of

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,529
analysis where I start to understand

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,360
more about how react works and what its

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:44,160
limitations are and I begin to be able

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,660
to evaluate it know where it's strong

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,970
and weak and how it compares to other

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,850
things in the same space and then

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,649
eventually if I'm so motivated I could

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,330
move towards creating you know extending

00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:58,140
core react or using it in new ways that

00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:01,830
haven't been thought of before and all

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,510
this is you know if you think about a

00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,820
skill that you've acquired recently

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,230
something you've learned to do you might

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,640
recognize some of these phases but

00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,230
they're blurry they're very fuzzy it's

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,200
not like you suddenly flick between them

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,490
and I bring this up to point out that

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,839
you probably need to be somewhere in

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,940
this region before you can apply

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,970
deliberate practice because you need to

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,850
be able to decompose the thing into

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:28,200
individual components and this guy means

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:29,430
that at least at the beginning you're

00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,930
going to be putting in work without

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,040
really feeling like you're learning and

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,800
that can be very damaging to your

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,740
motivation if you understand why it's

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,870
happening then hopefully you can push

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,480
through and once you get to the analyze

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:44,070
phase everything accelerates you start

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,010
to be able to ask and answer your own

00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:50,060
questions learning becomes deeper

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:52,200
motivation becomes much more intrinsic

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,579
but you do have to accept it'll take

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,839
some time before you feel like you're

00:12:53,579 --> 00:13:01,430
learning when you pick up something new

00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:01,430
and it's hard work sorry it's hard work

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,360
maintaining focus keeping in mind the

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,980
the thing that you've isolated when you

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,050
have other things to do and it's

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,630
cognitively difficult taking breaks is

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,520
is totally recommended in this situation

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,810
when you study something for two hours

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,890
and then go for a walk your brain is

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,820
still processing and when you're

00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,590
sleeping you learn

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,700
things you know things better when you

00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,560
wake up than you did when you went to

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,580
bed

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,790
they had a great phrase which I've

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,740
already spoiled for you in the MIT AI

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,540
lab in the 1960s where they studied

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,660
learning in Rio in relation to computer

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,460
programming they had this idea that as

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,780
computers became more and more

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,310
complicated they would approach the

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,500
complexity of the human brain and

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,030
teaching someone a skill and programming

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,820
a computer would become basically the

00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,460
same thing I'm not so sure that's worked

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,680
out but they had this phrase it's hard

00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,060
fun rather than hard work because you

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,070
get to the end I don't know if any of

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,600
you have ever run a half marathon or a

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,520
marathon or anything like that and every

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,290
step is a bit of a chore and then you

00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,410
get to the end you're like all right I'm

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,820
finding up for another one because it's

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,230
really fun it wasn't fun whilst you were

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,730
doing it that's what they mean by hard

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:12,060
fun so I'd like to talk now about some

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,440
specific techniques that I've used

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,820
effectively that other people have told

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,380
me they've used effectively and you can

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:21,810
read about for effective use of the time

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:27,600
that you can find in your safe space to

00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:29,550
learn I left it downstairs but there's a

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,960
book called apprenticeship patterns does

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:33,450
anybody know this book apprenticeship

00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,830
patterns okay take it as a

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,330
recommendation from me it's one of the

00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,310
best books on career development I've

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,140
ever read apprenticeship patterns and

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,120
they say feedback loops are the

00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,420
fundamental way to improve your learning

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,000
experience feedback loops you have a

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,800
question you get an answer to like does

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,210
this work I'll try it does it work you

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,370
find out or you get a helpful error

00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:56,040
message hopefully if it doesn't make

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,750
those as quick as possible automate the

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,930
boring stuff to make those as quick as

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,670
possible there's a few reasons why fast

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,610
feedback loops are especially important

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:08,430
firstly you can just do more thing you

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:11,250
can try more things secondly and this is

00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,660
often mentioned in the context of

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,240
test-driven development where you want

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,740
very quick running tests if you don't

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,200
have a fast feedback loop you'll get

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,240
bored they say and they find that

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,650
slightly insulting like if my tests take

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,420
more than 30 seconds I'm just going to

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:28,350
go to the coffee machine and play pool

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,760
and stuff but but it's it can you know

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,139
make it more exciting if things are

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,290
quicker for sure

00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,569
and there's a deeper reason as well as a

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,100
psychologist called psychologist and

00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,389
Fortran programmer I learned recently

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,739
called Daniel Kahneman

00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:48,389
who won the Nobel Prize in Economics he

00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:50,189
studied intuition and intuition in this

00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:52,439
sense is accurately making technical

00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:55,410
decisions without analyzing every step

00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:58,799
of the process and he found like

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,389
firefighters his famous example deciding

00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,249
when to leave a burning building they

00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:03,929
don't do a lot of analysis they just

00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:06,389
feel it and they go and he found

00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:08,399
intuition is a thing that can enable you

00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:10,350
to make quick and accurate decisions

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,119
under certain circumstances you need a

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,819
predictable environment so there's no

00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:17,669
intuition about lottery numbers you need

00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:20,609
practice the more the better and you

00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:22,679
need feedback the quicker the better so

00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:24,299
when you hear someone who's able to very

00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,359
quickly make an accurate assessment of

00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:30,720
some new technology or some new

00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:33,540
technique it's it's likely that they're

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,339
using an intuitive way of making that

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,079
decision and it's important that they

00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,759
should be able to step back and provide

00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,649
an analytical reason if you ask them to

00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,959
but this kind of quick decision-making

00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:45,419
is enabled by fast feedback loops

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:49,529
secondly I would recommend you to find

00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:51,720
and focus on your fundamentals I'm sure

00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,160
you've already found and will continue

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,679
to find that there are certain skills

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,559
knowledge technologies that come up

00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:01,679
again and again when you're coding on

00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,949
different things it's somewhat the

00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:07,079
opposite of chasing the shiny new things

00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:09,139
for me I think the fundamental things

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,850
that have been very helpful to me are

00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:13,919
understanding the model of the web

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:17,819
clients and servers request some

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,439
responses knowing about the JVM and Java

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,120
because I've been a Java programmer for

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,789
a long time enclosure as they mentioned

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,049
and knowing about Linux bash scripting

00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:27,240
and also a little bit about the kernel

00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:28,620
it's been very widely applicable but it

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,779
took me a long time to recognize that

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,519
those were things that if practiced in

00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,669
isolation could bring like benefits

00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:38,100
broadly across across lots of projects I

00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:40,049
think you should beware of tools and

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,059
frameworks that tell you you don't need

00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:44,790
to know the basics like here's a new

00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:47,220
client server toolkit which abstracts

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,570
HTTP and you don't need to know it well

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,250
that's a lie because as soon as it

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,750
doesn't work like you expect or as soon

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,310
as that you need to debug anything or

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,490
extend it in somewhere you will need to

00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:58,800
know it and you've taken the shortcut

00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,390
which now you have to backtrack is going

00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,210
to end up costing more time in the long

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:06,900
run the book pragmatic programmer calls

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:09,060
these evil wizards so I think it's a

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,620
great great phrase I talked about

00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,310
something now that we're all doing here

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,370
today social learning can be fun it

00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:20,400
really can finding people to share your

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,350
learning journey with not everyone

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,150
enjoys the same things you can't force

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,530
someone to be your social learning buddy

00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:30,510
people learn in different ways but if

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,670
you talk about your learning and what

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,350
you're interested in people and people

00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,630
you will find people who are interested

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,940
in going with you

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:41,790
accountability partners book study

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,290
groups at work or at uni or amongst your

00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,030
friends are great and if you can't think

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,800
what's a good book to start with I would

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,260
recommend there's a series of books

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,030
seven things in seven weeks I think the

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,340
first one was seven languages in seven

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,990
weeks we spend seven weeks in a row each

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:57,090
one on a different programming language

00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,100
and you bootstrapped right to the

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,950
comparison the evaluation kind of stage

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,140
of learning because you get a very quick

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,880
precise introduction to these things and

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,240
you see so many of them in comparison to

00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,730
each other so book study groups at work

00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,590
I've got a lot out of those it's great

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,730
because you you also get to know your

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:19,830
colleagues better you get to know where

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,510
you get the if you choose a nice book

00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,040
like the seven languages one everyone's

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,860
a beginner in some bit of it so it

00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,270
levels the playing field of some people

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,500
being experts and wanting to sort of

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:33,150
dominate the conversation excuse me

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,590
group working pairing especially with

00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,450
people you don't often pair with on

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:43,590
learning projects is a really really

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:45,030
great way as well so about today there

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:49,470
are conferences thank you for coming to

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:50,850
this one people come to a conference and

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,350
they pay a lot of attention to who's

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,690
speaking and what they're speaking about

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,360
and it's true Kevin and the underlined

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,020
team have put a great program together

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,380
for you

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,950
but there are 250 other people here who

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,080
you can learn from as well as us

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,610
there's it's referred to it the hallway

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,230
track right where people you just bump

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,450
into downstairs there's even a specific

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,940
hour at the end of the day set up for

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:19,500
the hallway track like me you may be

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,630
rather nervous of striking up new

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,520
conversations with strangers and I can

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,610
give you an icebreaker that someone gave

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,410
to me which is what's an interesting

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,940
thing that you've learned recently you

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:35,429
can have that for free please use it I

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,050
like it because if someone asks me that

00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:39,540
I'm not I don't have to talk about

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:42,270
myself so the kind of shyness aspect of

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,679
my personality is doesn't come doesn't

00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,540
sort of stop me from talking because I

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,890
like I learned about a particular type

00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:52,800
of pigeon or I learned something new

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:53,970
about how a browser works meetups people

00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,679
think meetups may be like mini

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,950
conferences but there's a couple of big

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,420
differences you can meet the same people

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,970
over and over and you might find

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,250
learning buddies there but I've run a

00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,130
couple of meetups in Bristol for the

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,080
last few years and I'll tell you now if

00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,950
anyone wants to come to Bristol and

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,890
speaker a meet-up

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,510
I will be in your debt you will be my

00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:18,480
hero and my best friend straight away

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:21,840
because the the challenge of getting new

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,730
speakers to meetups is constant so if

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,730
you're interested in learning something

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:30,420
why not offer to present about it at a

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:33,720
meet-up the organizers will thank you a

00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:35,910
lot and douglas adams in one of his dirt

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,920
gently books there's a section where

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,660
they're talking about education and he

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,610
says if you really want to understand

00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,920
something the best way is to try and

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,679
explain it to someone else that forces

00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,740
you to sort it out in your own mind so

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,790
this is a selfish and unselfish way of

00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,740
learning

00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,059
it's unselfish because you're sharing

00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,440
knowledge bringing people up with you

00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:57,000
but it's kind of selfish because you're

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,440
putting yourself on the line and you

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,480
have to learn something yourself and

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,010
you'll become the expert in the room on

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,110
that thing whether you want to or not

00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:07,679
once you've committed to doing it it's

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:09,600
also fun whilst we're on the topic of

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,460
conferences and the hallway track I

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,730
wonder how many of you know about this

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,420
thing

00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:18,420
it's called the pacman rule a small

00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,210
handful okay i'll introduce it on the

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:24,150
left we can practice it later is a group

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:27,030
of six people chatting in a closed

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,010
circle and and the poor the poor yellow

00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,620
person can't get into the conversation

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:34,530
they're very sad about it on the right

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,270
the six people have remembered for the

00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,830
pack no rule to step back and leave a

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,780
space for new people to join the

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:44,790
conversation well if you've been

00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:46,350
learning about recently so if you get a

00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,970
chance to practice that later it would

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:56,280
be really great to see more and more

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:57,960
people talking some more learning keep a

00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,970
learning diary I'm not sure if you can

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,670
read it from there that's my learning

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:05,930
diary on top of my what I did each day

00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,930
diary they're separate things

00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,650
it's an old one from when I worked at

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,820
Oracle and I hope there's no secrets

00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,930
they're probably fine it's easy to

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,490
forget how far you've come

00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,370
I read my learning Diaries going back

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,720
several years and Oh crikey I remember

00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,610
there was a time when I didn't know that

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,780
and now it's like it's part of something

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,520
I do every day without thinking about

00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,670
it's very easy everything you learned is

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,730
your new status quo straight away but

00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:34,050
also reviewing your learning diary in 20

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,460
minutes or so you can read through a

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,290
year's worth of learning and you'll

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,940
create connections between things that

00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,770
weren't obvious at the time and it's a

00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,840
way that you can find your fundamentals

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,900
and identify those things that really

00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,180
are like critical to your experience

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,730
isn't like a very slow form of feedback

00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,320
loop everyone learns differently this is

00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,980
a well-established thing some people

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,600
like reading some listening I struggled

00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,480
really hard learning things through

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,010
videos I'm a reader podcasts I find it

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,240
difficult to focus on but everyone's

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,970
different there's nothing wrong with any

00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,890
particular style identify your style and

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,350
make time whilst you're having your

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,390
breakfast listen to a podcast or whilst

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,330
you're waiting for your colleagues to

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,980
arrive in the morning read a blog it's a

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,690
great thing to make a habit of it

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,309
doesn't have to take a lot of time and

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:25,499
it's additive it builds up and up over

00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:32,190
you end up with very broad set of

00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:35,549
knowledge so in summary create your safe

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,840
space and embrace missteps think about

00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:39,330
deliberate practice think about

00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,860
practicing things in isolation create

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,110
fast feedback loops like I mentioned I'm

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,700
a Java programmer Java projects can be a

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,110
pain in the ass to setup it can take

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,029
like 10 minutes to get a hello world

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,580
working depending on how you configure

00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:53,009
it so I keep a pre-canned hello world

00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,869
project opening an IDE minimized and

00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:57,419
then when I have something I want to try

00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:59,759
I could just um minimize it try the

00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,350
thing does it work or not maybe just

00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,600
delete that code back to a hello world

00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,340
and then and it's out of the way get

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,269
used to the JavaScript console in the

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,249
browser learn keyboard shortcuts for

00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:12,840
your favorite editor just get used to

00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:17,100
being able to do things quickly and get

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,619
feedback quickly on your thoughts find

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,059
your fundamentals as I mentioned

00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:23,190
socializing your learning it's super

00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:25,590
super powerful keep yourself for today I

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:30,029
learned diary and find your learning

00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:32,039
style and engage in it we still have

00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:34,529
like I showed at the beginning 95% of

00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:35,639
2020 left so it's not too late I don't

00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:39,659
think it's too late for New Year's

00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:41,909
resolution I try setting some learning

00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:43,499
goals for 2020 and be explicit about the

00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:49,950
fact that they're for learning and not

00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:51,840
for any particular technology so you

00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,899
have got this are you've got this thank

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,460
you very much for listening and here's

00:25:54,899 --> 00:26:00,679
where you can go to find out more about

00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,679
