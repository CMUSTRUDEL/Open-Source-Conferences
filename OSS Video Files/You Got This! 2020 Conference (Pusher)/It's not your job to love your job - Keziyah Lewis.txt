Title: It's not your job to love your job - Keziyah Lewis
Publication date: 2020-02-16
Playlist: You Got This! 2020 Conference
Description: 
	Tech workers are under enormous pressure to put our jobs above anything else in our lives. Startup culture encourages self sacrifice and overwork in order to complete the company’s mission. As early career devs, it’s easy to feel that we should be grateful to have a job in this industry, especially when you have a decent salary and perks, and your boss is constantly reminding you that you’re part of a “family” that is “changing the world”.

Loving or appreciating your job isn’t a problem on its own. But you’re not obligated to do it. In fact, I’d argue that the pressure to love your job can be dangerous. Using examples from my personal experience and from the tech industry as a whole, I’ll talk about how unconditional job love is used to exploit or mistreat tech workers.

You’ll leave this talk with a better understanding of techniques employers use to mask workplace issues, how to view your workplace more critically, how to spot cultural red flags, and how to advocate for yourself and your colleagues.

Keziyah Lewis is a Black and queer web developer, designer, and digital nomad. She curates Juniors in Tech, a newsletter for early career technologists. Keziyah is passionate about eliminating barriers to entering tech, making the industry more diverse and just, and making tech companies better places to work.

Wow I'm so happy to be here thank you

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,649
all for being here thank you Kevin and

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,110
Sonny for inviting me and I'm really

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,660
excited to be here so my name is Josiah

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,100
and this is it's not your job to love

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,119
your job couple years ago I started my

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,890
very first developer job in the industry

00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:26,250
and one afternoon I was sitting on my

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,349
couch my laptop on my lap on my computer

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,599
and I was listening to our company's

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,520
weekly All Hands call with a remote

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,950
first company so I was working out of

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,750
Florida at the time you know it's a

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,030
typical All Hands call so we talked

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,489
about I don't know different things that

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,260
the teams are doing announcements we

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,420
were planning a trip to Ireland later in

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,940
the summer you know just typical like

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,989
all team meeting stuff suddenly I was

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,329
listening to the call I was kind of

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:58,050
zoning out and I heard this phrase that

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,840
I never expected my CEO to say two weeks

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,260
to runway this is not something you ever

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,930
want to hear from anyone who works with

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,780
you the CEO was talking about how there

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,780
were times within our company's history

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,760
where we might have only had about two

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,710
weeks of money left to keep the company

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,600
running but somehow they always pulled

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,540
through and raised enough money to keep

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,360
going which is good because you know I

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,040
still had a job obviously but it wasn't

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,330
something I was expecting here I had no

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,689
idea at the time

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,829
that the company was in such bad shape

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:35,369
hearing this phrase gave me a lot of

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,840
anxiety I started to doubt myself I

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,329
started to doubt whether or not I

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,430
belonged in this position I didn't want

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,820
to believe that anything was wrong with

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,290
the company that I was working at

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,869
especially since you know I felt so

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,030
lucky as a junior engineer to have a job

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,920
in the first place I had a remote job I

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,549
was able to travel here's a picture of

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,500
me in Medellin Colombia I had a job I

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,729
was able to travel I was doing exciting

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,009
things I was getting paid well you know

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,960
I had my dream job so to hear suddenly

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,289
that we weren't in a financially good

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,150
place it was really scary for me I liked

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,390
my job and I felt very lucky especially

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,190
other

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:20,069
junior engineer so even when red and

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,750
yellow flags kept popping up throughout

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,750
my time there I just kind of ignored

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:28,530
them and pushed them to the side for

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,360
example it's you know there are times

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,920
when we were even when we had a very

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,060
little runway left when we had very

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,110
little money in the bank

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,510
we kept hiring people I realized that I

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,930
wasn't really progressing in my career I

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,340
wasn't really going anywhere

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,370
later on I realized that the job I had

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,860
didn't really align with my values we

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,840
got paid late a couple times which is

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,630
extremely frustrating and which is

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,910
definitely a red flag for any company

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,030
the company was taking really huge

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,620
financial risks starting new programs

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,830
new initiatives that we couldn't really

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,500
afford to do there was some groupthink

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,019
going on it felt like it was really hard

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,680
for us to really disagree with things

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,610
that were going on with the company I

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,170
didn't really have an important role

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,790
with the company the engineering team

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,590
was just me and one other junior

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,560
engineer so I felt like the work I was

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,820
doing wasn't really contributing to the

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,459
rest of the company and I was just given

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,560
a lot of busy work and also I didn't

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,000
really have I had a manager but it

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,560
wasn't really the equivalent of what he

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,540
would expect an engineering manager to

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,360
be because of that lack of management I

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,230
didn't really have the career for

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,850
Russian that I would expect so one day

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,620
about a year after that call he ended up

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,470
getting laid off and I posted this tweet

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,880
to Twitter and I'm sure most of you if

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,209
you're on Twitter you've seen a tweet

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,980
like this it's like hey I lost my job

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:56,220
this is what I do please help me find a

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,380
new job right this was actually posted

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,269
the very day that I got me that I found

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,540
out I was getting laid off March 4th of

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,370
last year after it happened I just kept

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,320
making to myself you know what the hell

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,200
happened how did I get into the

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,810
situation where I was at a job that I

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,180
knew that I really loved but I just kept

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,940
ignoring the red signs how did I let my

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,709
affection my love for my job get in the

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,919
way of basic common sense and looking

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,300
after myself a little about me I know

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,620
Justin Matt told you about me but

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,380
the slides here so I'm going to tell you

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,900
about myself again so I'm a web

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,699
developer I'm a front-end engineer I'm a

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:38,259
digital nomad I love to travel

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:39,539
I love remote work Jeff wanted me to

00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:43,410
mention some of the places I've been

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:45,669
Colombia Mexico where else have I been

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,849
when I used to teach I taught in Saudi

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,210
Arabia and Spain so travels a big thing

00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:53,440
for me

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,120
I run the juniors and tech newsletter

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,900
which is basically a weekly roundup of

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,909
career advice junior jobs and just a

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,020
bunch of other things just for people

00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:05,349
like us who are just starting our

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,470
careers in tech and I'm on Twitter way

00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:10,300
too much my username is because il

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:14,380
please don't follow me you will be

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,940
disappointed so this talk is it's not

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,520
your job to love your job and maybe some

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,259
of you are thinking well ok uh like most

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:25,300
of us don't really like our jobs anyway

00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:29,650
and that's true to some extent only 34

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,479
34 percent of workers in the u.s. and 11

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,250
percent of workers in the UK are engaged

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,110
at work so a lot of people don't really

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,659
like their jobs right but even if you

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,870
don't like your job we kind of have a

00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:43,270
tendency to prioritize our jobs and to

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,979
kind of commit to our jobs in a way that

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,830
gets in the way of other things in our

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:50,469
lives right

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,659
for example 38% of workers in one survey

00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:56,139
missed a child's important event for

00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:59,979
work 24% of working parents see their

00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:03,009
kids to ask them to work less in the UK

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:05,169
you all work 2.5 more weeks more per

00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:08,969
year than other countries in the eat

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:12,699
than the average EU worker why is that

00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:17,770
and you all only only 1/3 of you have

00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:19,599
found a good work/life balance so I was

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,699
really kicking myself when I got laid

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:24,400
off trying to figure out what happened

00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:27,639
how I got myself to that point and I

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,590
wanted to really analyze just what

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,419
happened like how did I get myself to a

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,760
point where I was so attached to a job

00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:36,580
that I couldn't really see it for what

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,040
it really was and I wanted to figure out

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:42,420
three things why did I stay it

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,560
job how did they keep me at this job and

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,600
what would I do now I could go back in

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,630
time and tell past keziah if I could

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,500
give her some advice

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,020
it's basically what we're gonna talk

00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,200
about today why did I stay at this job

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,600
what is the psychology behind staying at

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,610
a job that you know is not good for you

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,250
what's going on in our minds when we try

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,070
to push away those red flags and ignore

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:09,070
them what are some strategies that

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:12,610
employers views knowingly or not to keep

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:15,550
workers around and what advice would I

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:20,170
give to you or to my past self to

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:22,270
prevent this from happening again so

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:24,850
let's talk about why I stayed at this

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,400
job I can hear some of you laughing I'm

00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,560
sure you've seen this comic by KC Dream

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,120
in the first part the comic there's a

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,270
dog sitting at a coffee table enjoying

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,250
coffee while their building is literally

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,410
burning down in the second part they're

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,390
saying this is fine because apparently

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,860
being in a burning building and having

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:48,100
coffee is fine so this dog kind of

00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,140
reminds me of myself if you can think of

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,510
the burning building is like my old job

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,670
like I could see the flames around me I

00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,380
could I'm inhaling the smoke I can feel

00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,390
the heat but I'm still just sitting

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,190
there in my job thing everything's fine

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:03,520
we got paid late whatever it's fine

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:07,240
I wanted to do more research into the

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,460
psychology of that psychologists have

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,430
studied how we create illusions to deal

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,020
with the difficulty of reality so there

00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,300
are times when we do have a

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,090
psychological need to believe that

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,290
everything is fine even when it's not

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,810
Shelly Taylor and Jonathan Brown

00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,610
identified a cognitive bias called the

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,430
positive illusion

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,950
it's basically a cognitive bias where

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,480
you think positively about yourself and

00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,669
about your situations and your

00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,349
surrounding your surroundings and you do

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,120
that in order to maintain your mental

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,590
health it's kind of like if you were to

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,110
face the reality your mental health

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,650
would suffer so in order to avoid that

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:47,940
you try to create a positive illusion

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,940
about what you're experiencing

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,300
and they identified that positive

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,430
Aleutians have three characteristics

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,829
the first is unrealistically positive

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,290
self evaluations so people tend to think

00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:01,870
highly of themselves compared to others

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,880
when we think of ourselves we exaggerate

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:07,360
our positive traits and we kind of

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:11,459
ignore our negative traits exaggerated

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,959
perceptions of control so we think of

00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:16,390
situations that are completely out of

00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,820
control or that are completely up to

00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,820
chance and we exaggerate our effect on

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,760
those situations so for example I think

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,700
there was some study where they had two

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,070
people working as team to try to I guess

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,660
roll a die or flip a coin to get a

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,260
certain result in order to win the game

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:39,730
and people found this psychologist found

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:41,470
that people preferred to roll the dice

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,790
themselves instead of letting their

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,130
partner roll the dice because they

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,310
decided that they had a greater effect

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,890
on the outcome of the game even though

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,170
it was totally up to chance

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,870
and the third characteristic is unreal

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,750
at this unrealistic optimism which is

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,029
basically the idea that we are

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,339
unrealistically optimist

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,290
we have unrealistic realistic optimism

00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:07,570
about our futures we generally think

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:11,709
that more good things and bad things

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,209
will happen to us in the future so

00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:16,600
positive illusion is what makes us think

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:18,399
everything is fine even when we not Eve

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,959
even when it's not and again these are

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,760
illusions that we create in order to

00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:26,320
maintain our mental health some when we

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,990
look back at this comic we can kind of

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,390
understand why this dog thinks that

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,699
everything is fine even though you know

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,920
they're literally gonna die if they stay

00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:38,440
in that burning building right because

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,060
if they were to face the reality of hey

00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm in a burning building I need to get

00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,160
out they would probably freak out right

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,810
it would cause harm to their mental

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,130
health so it's easier for them to think

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:53,709
that everything's fine and I thought

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:55,870
about myself and my previous job and I

00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:58,270
realized that I think it's why I stuck

00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:01,410
with this job even though I knew deep

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,410
down it wasn't good for me

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,069
so even though I saw all these red flags

00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,509
I was still optimistic I still really

00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:11,759
thought that everything was going to be

00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:15,300
okay think about the last time you were

00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:18,420
in a situation a bad situation a

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,459
relationship a job whatever it was where

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,130
you knew things weren't going well but

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,839
you still held on for some reason you

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,579
still thought to yourself everything's

00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:31,440
gonna be okay things will turn around

00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:34,440
etc this is how the convict ends we

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,500
don't often see this when it's used as a

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,360
meme on social media but basically the

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,339
dog is continuing to drink their coffee

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,800
and says I'm okay with the events that

00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,389
are unfolding currently and then that's

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,399
okay things are going to be okay and in

00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:51,089
the very last panel their face is

00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,040
getting melted off so remember that

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:56,069
positive solutions basically shape our

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,860
mental health admitting the reality of

00:11:56,069 --> 00:12:00,509
what was going on at my job probably

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,949
would have been detrimental to my mental

00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:03,899
health in fact there were times when I

00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:05,310
did admit to myself what was going on

00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:07,889
and I couldn't sleep

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,930
my anxiety went up it was just really

00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:13,500
difficult for me and then a little bit

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,389
of time passed and things got better I

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,490
was like okay you know I'm not gonna

00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:20,370
lose my job for going to Ireland next

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,800
month everything's fine everything's

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,939
fine and you know it was easier for me

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,660
to believe that everything was just

00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:29,699
going to be okay all right so now I

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,279
understand a little about why I stayed

00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:36,240
at this job that I really shouldn't have

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:39,209
stayed at I want to talk about what

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,699
strategies employers might use knowingly

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:44,160
or not to kind of keep workers sticking

00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:46,560
around I think that it involves three

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,899
things you have to get your employees to

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,519
believe in the company you have to get

00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,199
to the care about the company and then

00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,170
to believe the company cares about them

00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:59,939
also you also have to get them to fight

00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:01,410
for and sacrifice for the company so

00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:04,310
getting them to believe in the companies

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,839
involves something called a hero story a

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,750
startup hero story is some sort of

00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:13,170
positive or uplifting narrative about a

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,640
start of origins and its founders and

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,610
the cub

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:20,480
operations this is something you'll see

00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:24,320
on like a websites about page or in any

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,240
kind of media and in a blog post and you

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,220
know any kind of marketing that sort of

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:34,100
thing I think that startup hero stories

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,950
have three characteristics humble

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,950
origins and exaggerated impact on the

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:43,000
world and a minimization of harm done to

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:45,470
society let's look at some examples

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,750
humble origins is basically started from

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,660
the bottom now we're here right you hear

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,860
of a lot of startups that start in

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,270
someone's garage or in someone's dorm

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,930
room where it was started by a person

00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:59,150
while they were homeless etc rags to

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:04,030
riches stories are rare and we're

00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,030
attracted to that kind of exceptionalism

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,640
hero stories also promote the idea that

00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,620
they have an exaggerated impact on the

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,870
world I'm sure you've heard of a lot of

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,580
startups that kind of promote this idea

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,390
that they're going to revolutionize that

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:22,000
or disrupt something else or

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:26,270
fundamentally change something

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,200
for example Landis School this is a

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:34,760
coding bootcamp that I you do not like

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:37,970
and they claim to be pioneering a new

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:43,610
model of higher education let's look at

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:45,770
another example fair nose Elizabeth

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,630
Holmes once said to her staff you are

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:50,180
all a part of something that it's a

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,070
revolution what higher purpose is there

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,160
I mean I can think of like 30 other

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:59,110
higher purposes and making a machine

00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,110
that doesn't even work but I don't know

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,090
the final characters characteristic of a

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:09,670
hero story is the minimization is harm

00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:12,830
to society so hero stories will kind of

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:15,250
they want us to think that the company

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:19,340
existing is a net good in the world

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:23,030
they're usually not right this is from a

00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,730
way the luggage company says on their

00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,050
about page that they've partnered with a

00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:31,010
nonprofit that and

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:33,170
peacebuilding nice I guess

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:36,019
this is Facebook this is a blog right

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,120
written by Mark Zuckerberg in which he

00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,279
said it's not enough to simply connect

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,950
the world we must also bring the world

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,899
closer together what sounds wonderful

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,519
you know he's trying to make it seem

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:51,040
like Facebook isn't that good in the

00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:51,040
world and we know that it's not right so

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,230
these are the three characteristic fact

00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:59,930
characteristics that make up a hero

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,209
story humble origins exaggerated impact

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,430
on the world and a minimis minimization

00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:07,240
is harm to society hero stories are

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:10,370
really important because they attract

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,399
well it's marketing basically it's good

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:16,730
PR they attract investor investors and

00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,529
you attract talent as well right nine

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,540
out of ten people are willing to earn

00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:24,230
less money to do more meaningful work

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:26,029
and forty-two percent of workers want to

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:31,070
work for a company that has a positive

00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:32,630
impact on the world so we like hero

00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,050
stories because we want to be a part of

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:38,060
our story and companies may or may not

00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,820
know this maybe they do but having a

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,820
really good hero story is a good way to

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:47,620
get employed and attract talent and get

00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,620
them this day even when they shouldn't

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,839
so hero stories aren't necessarily bad

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,540
but I want to sought to be careful about

00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:01,220
not drinking the kool-aid because that's

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:04,699
exactly what I did at my last job this

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:08,300
is cringe worthy um so I believed in the

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:10,669
executives at this company before I even

00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,189
met them I knew about their story I

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:15,770
followed them on Twitter I was really

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,199
inspired by what they were doing so on

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,270
the very first day of my job they flew

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,490
me out to California for some like all

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:26,390
team meeting there was a reporter there

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:29,179
who was doing a report on a company for

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,890
a podcast and she asked something like

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,750
about whether or not we're worried about

00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,540
how things are going with the company

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,910
and I chimed in on my very first day and

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,320
said I trust founder when she named and

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,480
found a Tuesday under G's name

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,919
um and it's cringe-worthy for me to

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,130
think about that because I literally did

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,769
not know these people but I felt like I

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:54,299
could trust them because of the story

00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:55,710
that I had been told about them so the

00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,899
next time you come across the company's

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,179
hero story I want you to practice being

00:17:57,899 --> 00:18:02,370
more critical and not taking everything

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,110
at face value I'm sure there are

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,610
companies out there that you admire that

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,250
you really want to work for maybe you

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:10,080
follow to see you on Twitter I may be

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:13,169
the few it makes really good dad jokes

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,230
on Twitter or something but I want you

00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:19,110
to just be critical of companies and

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:24,539
remember that hero stories are it's

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:26,519
marketing basically so after you get

00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,690
employees to believe in your company you

00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,299
have to get them to care about the

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,820
company and to believe that the company

00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:36,419
cares about them as people this is what

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:39,360
I'm calling enforced familiar II it's

00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:41,730
the idea that when companies Pro bi when

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,559
companies promote the idea that everyone

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,600
at the company cares for one another and

00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:49,019
that the company hasn't had to be cares

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,720
about the employees and that they have

00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:54,720
the employees best interests in mind and

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,120
it's okay to care about your your your

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,600
boss or your co-workers or whatever um

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,539
it's totally natural more than 50% of

00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,440
tech workers have a work BFF and you're

00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:10,799
1.4 times more likely to receive praise

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,629
if you have a work BFF and also seventy

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,370
percent of workers say having a friend

00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:18,600
at work is crucial to a happy healthy

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:21,450
work life here are some examples of

00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,080
enforced familiarity describing

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,669
colleagues is family which I really hate

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,220
talking about soft care and work-life

00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:30,179
balance

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,610
encouraging bringing your whole self to

00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:35,940
work claiming to care about diversity

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:38,909
and inclusion encouraging transparency

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,370
and openness and having company values

00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:41,730
like compassion empathy kindness or

00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,649
whatever

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,570
most of these are good except the first

00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,639
one first one is very bad don't ever do

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,740
the first one the rest of them are

00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:52,210
really good and I don't mind it and I

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,880
like seeing this fun company about pages

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,040
um you know that's good the problem is

00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,760
they may not reflect the reality of how

00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:04,240
companies are actually run this is from

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,130
NPM about page and I just want to I just

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,290
have a couple paragraphs about like what

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,230
they believe in or whatever I just want

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,940
to highlight the parts that kind of talk

00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,820
about is enforced familiarity that I'm

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:18,310
talking about not a typical work hard

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:21,060
play hard start up taking care of

00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:23,520
ourselves our families and one another

00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,740
sustainable approach to work in life

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,230
compassion is our strategy that all

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,600
sounds great we know that's not true

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,150
if you followed the NPM layoff story

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,170
from last year this is an article from

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:42,400
the register on the layoffs layoffs

00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:45,880
always suck right but a lot of people

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,960
who formerly used to work at NPM had a

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,670
problem with how the layoffs were done

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,250
one developer advocate former developer

00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,840
developer advocate advocate for NPM said

00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,030
that he thought there was a disconnect

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,480
between the company's values its

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,480
behavior

00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,390
another source told the register that

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,010
they had an all-hands meeting and

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,470
encouraged people to speak up and ask

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,330
honest questions and the bawling week

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,130
they were fired that's not a very

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,230
compassionate way to treat your

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,180
employees you shouldn't fire people for

00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:20,170
asking questions at an all-hands meeting

00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:23,500
I want you to remember two things about

00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:26,470
enforced familiarity the first is that

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,420
more familiarity often means fewer

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,100
boundaries right we have fewer

00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,180
boundaries for people who were more

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,500
familiar with who are closer to and

00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,380
fewer boundaries often means

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,570
exploitation the second thing is that

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,810
caring about your colleagues and your

00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:47,730
managers and your CEO is fine but you

00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:51,610
can't ignore the power dynamic and

00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:54,040
finally your employer can't you're your

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,200
boss just as people can care about you

00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,450
but your employer the company as an

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,310
entity cannot care about you

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,350
right because the company itself is not

00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,180
a person the only thing the company

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,690
itself cares about is the bottom line

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,690
right

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,149
so let's talk about the final thing once

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:16,179
you have people believing in your

00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:18,070
company once you kind of make it seem

00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:19,390
like you care about them you can get

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:24,429
them to sacrifice for you

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:25,929
I'm calling this noble sacrifice this is

00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:28,149
one employers pressure workers into

00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:30,399
sacrificing for the greater good at the

00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:33,130
company things like working long hours

00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:38,020
with no extra pay doing extra work

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:42,279
getting paid less etc this is an article

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:45,309
by April Glaser from inflate about

00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,289
Kickstarter's union busting it says

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:49,539
employees joining Kickstarter sometimes

00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:50,529
take a salary that is lower than market

00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:52,630
rate because they believe in

00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:54,309
kick-started mission and want to lend

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,679
their labor for a meaningful cause

00:22:54,309 --> 00:23:00,340
they're sacrificing their pay for this

00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:04,809
company I would never do that but Judas

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:06,279
of them it's just the away piece the

00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:09,640
piece about a weight luggage that was

00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:10,990
published in The Verge last month if you

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,649
haven't read it you should definitely

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:17,649
read it it's very eye-opening in this

00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:20,260
piece they talked about how the customer

00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:22,120
support reps for a way they were

00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,909
basically demeaned and berated by the

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,309
CEO they were emotionally abused they

00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:29,860
were denied time off all kinds of things

00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:31,929
one of the support the support rep said

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,149
that she was overworked and underpaid

00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:36,760
but something in her wanting to keep

00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:38,740
going I wanted to move closer to work so

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,279
I could work more but I couldn't afford

00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,940
it she believed in the company so much

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,529
that even though she was being

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,990
overworked and underpaid she still

00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:49,659
wanted to sacrifice more of herself for

00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:52,779
this company we're asked to sacrifice so

00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:56,649
many things for work right not just our

00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:59,230
time our labor or money sometimes we're

00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:05,649
asked to sacrifice our right to raise a

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:07,510
family this is a headline about one

00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:09,130
person who has discriminated against for

00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,100
getting pregnant while working out we

00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:15,159
work sometimes we sacrifice our own

00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:17,289
mental health and this is a story about

00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:18,100
an uber engineers committed suicide

00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,580
after

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,690
complaining about job stats sometimes we

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,390
sacrificed our safety

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,910
this is Susan Fowler's blog post from a

00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,740
couple years ago about her experience

00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:33,039
does that uber with sexism and sexual

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:35,830
harassment sometimes we sacrifice our

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:40,179
values you may have heard recently that

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:42,419
several github employees resigned after

00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:44,650
github signed a contract with ice

00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:48,309
immigrations and Customs Enforcement in

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:51,809
the u.s. which is of course keeping kids

00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:54,280
in cages at the U X the us-mexico border

00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:56,440
and sometimes we sacrifice just our

00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,409
ability to be ourselves and to just

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,419
exist in the world of tech without being

00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:04,110
discriminated against this is a medium

00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:07,419
blog post that was published in November

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:12,130
in which Facebook employees talk about

00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:17,470
racism against the employees of color at

00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:21,730
Facebook so is it worth it if all the

00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:24,700
sacrifice for a job worth it I'm gonna

00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,169
say yes actually it's worth it for your

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,690
boss just want the for the CEO it's

00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:30,669
worth it for the shareholders it's never

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,700
worth it for you it's never worth it for

00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:36,840
us right so that's how they kept me

00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,970
around and I want to quickly talk about

00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,190
what I would do if I could go back in

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:45,130
time and talk to myself and give myself

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,890
some advice I made this presentation for

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,440
you all for the public but I mostly made

00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,750
it for myself as a way of kind of

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:57,429
thinking about what happened and trying

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:59,850
to I guess the wrongs from it so what

00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:03,640
would I do now it's four simple things

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:05,200
the first is be a little cynical don't

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,179
drink the kool-aid don't drink your

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,270
company's kool-aid it's very high in

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:11,919
sugar and it's bad for you but also just

00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,750
be a little cynical you don't have to

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,340
believe everything your company says you

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,169
can believe in their mission you can

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,000
believe in their story but you know just

00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:22,659
always keep like kind of a side eye on

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,059
them you know prepare for the worst you

00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:27,280
never know what's gonna happen I had no

00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:28,960
idea I was gonna get laid off I figured

00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,860
it it would had the possibility that's

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,350
happening but when it happened I was

00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:36,350
I had no idea what to do and I was

00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:40,100
freaking out so if you have a job or

00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:42,700
when you get a job and prepare for the

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,559
worst you never know what's gonna happen

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,140
your colleagues are your community watch
