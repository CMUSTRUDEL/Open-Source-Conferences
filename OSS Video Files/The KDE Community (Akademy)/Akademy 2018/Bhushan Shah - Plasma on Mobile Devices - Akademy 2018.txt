Title: Bhushan Shah - Plasma on Mobile Devices - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-05
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	KDE community have been working on Plasma Mobile with a goal of having open echosystem for Mobile devices. However the road to that goal has been very limited due to closed devices. While project halium has been helping us on that road, however what project halium is doing is essentially a workaround for the far bigger problem.

Mobile devices in market come with very old kernel and android software pre-installed. These softwares are generally not patched against the already discovered security vulnerabilities. While Plasma Mobile can work with such old stack using the hacks like libhybris, it doesn't help us achieve the goal of privacy and security.

The solution is to bring the support for these devices in the mainline kernel. This provides us with the up-to-date base system to work on (Linux 4.1x, Mesa graphics, DRM, Wayland) and we can avoid dealing with the binary blobs through halium/libhybris. Plasma Mobile community is recently working with the kernel developers to bring support for older phones like Nexus 5 to mailine kernel. (see links for details).

This talk includes some more technical details about the open devices and how Plasma Mobile works on such devices and what's next for Plasma Mobile project given such nice opportunity.

thank you very much so for those who

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:38,960
don't know me so I'm working on okay so

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,960
I will tell you plasma well project and

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:49,050
and so Katie community started working

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:53,399
on plasma web project in 2015 it was

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:59,539
introduced as a community project in

00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:03,839
2015 Academy the play was the project is

00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:07,770
to full control over information of the

00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:09,720
mobile devices and communication and it

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,780
should be inclusive to third-party

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:18,600
software and not like some closed down

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,450
systems like iOS and also seamless cross

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,600
cross device explain and salt

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:28,469
convergence as you call it and also we

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:35,039
were we wanted to use the open standard

00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:38,189
switch so today's my talk is about

00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:40,320
plasma mobile on open devices

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,930
it doesn't actually focus much on the

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,530
software side but actually more on the

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,479
hardware and basically it doesn't even

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,409
actually focus on the plasma more part

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:57,469
itself but the layers be below the

00:01:52,409 --> 00:02:00,750
plasma health and so as a background I

00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:04,469
took liberty of copying two slides from

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:09,509
my last year's presentation so last

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:13,470
year's presentation I basically provided

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:16,440
updates about my updates about for work

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,020
done in one year and at that time I

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,270
listed out some external

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,850
factors that affect the plasma by

00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:29,300
project and some of the challenges we

00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:32,490
were facing at that point so the

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,370
external factors listed were physically

00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,350
the devices which are currently in the

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,450
market have a really old Colonel

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,060
resinates is not reasonable to support

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,070
then for example lots of people here

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,400
will have a nexus while it supports a

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:51,540
three point four colonel so yeah that's

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,170
a ancient government and we also have a

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,180
lack of open devices that device is why

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,060
we don't have of some kind of device

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,050
schematics and where you don't really

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,300
know what's happening behind the scenes

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:08,940
so that makes it really hard to pull

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,100
something totally different than then

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:16,350
what manufacture wanted to put on that

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:18,900
device and also like the those devices

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:26,459
requires a closed source binary flops

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:28,400
and PSPs to function and so this this

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,670
were there

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,040
external factors and also I listed out

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,959
some of the open devices or the programs

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:43,709
which were which were known at that

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,840
point the one is open devices program by

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,830
Sony where they are basically trying to

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:54,300
open source as much as they can the

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:57,630
program is the it's a community effort

00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,430
to support as much as mainline do I as

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,880
much as devices we can support in the

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,160
mainline enough kernel and there is also

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,850
flat phone which provides open dua

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,990
schematic same and basically you can

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,700
replace the parts of yourself and also

00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,880
of course it was a question mark at that

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,650
point because it was not a rumor that

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,870
fusion will be reading of Linux phone

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,940
but of course it's not no longer a

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:29,300
question mark so that question mark

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:30,680
should not be there so back to present

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,520
so back

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,770
in this one year we had to work with the

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,190
several projects and several community

00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:46,220
members and several corporations as well

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:49,009
to to get to make it easier for open

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:53,690
software to be present on the mobile

00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:56,660
devices it's entirely physically not

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,120
structure default like it's basically

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,580
year different contributors working on

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:07,729
totally different issues and trying to

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:10,220
solve it so when it comes to the off the

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:13,130
self devices which are currently in the

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,910
market those comes with the old kernel

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:19,820
version but the Linux kernel have a part

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,620
in theory it can be put it can be

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,560
supported by the current mainline kernel

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,979
wasn't just you need to do some fall to

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,250
at the SOC system support in the for

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:33,639
example kernel if it's there you need to

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:39,530
you need to add of hardware supports and

00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:42,500
so basically one of some of the factors

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:45,440
are DRM and GPU drivers for example

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,409
there is a there is a free trainer

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,820
project which is reverse engineered

00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:54,050
driver for the adrenal qualcomm devices

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:57,080
there are Wi-Fi and

00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:00,349
putas traverse which needs to be open

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,240
sourced into mainline kernel and of

00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:05,479
course that is the phone part which is

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,010
the modem and telephony so for that

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,800
there is a project called Oh phone Oh

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,430
which we using platform was so more and

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:18,650
more drivers search should be added in

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:20,960
204 home and also there is a well mobile

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:26,240
app every hardware in the mobile for a

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:31,039
number camera sensors and everything so

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:36,249
well I'm at that

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:40,580
it was the next Oh in the past year we

00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:43,699
had supported many Qualcomm devices with

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:47,979
the mainline kernel you might have read

00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:52,009
my blog posting planet kitty dot org so

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:54,740
the pointing device is basically the

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,300
idea of came to my mind when well

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,749
basically I was starting to work on

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:04,370
plasma mobile there was a blog post by

00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:09,860
John you know which is so that Nexus 7

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:11,569
2013 model was running 2013 model was

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,330
running a mainline kernel and the

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,919
Android so I thought like if it's a

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,710
mainline kernel we will have open

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,559
drivers and in theory plasma wire could

00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:24,800
work online and of course I had no

00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:28,819
access to Nexus 7 2013 model or that it

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,539
was it was not easily available - it was

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:34,669
not easily available in market anyway

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:37,279
but I had a nexus 5 device which was a

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:44,509
referenced it was for plasma mobile at

00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:46,459
one point and so I got excited about

00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,009
this and like started reading up on

00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:52,550
various things and so I learned that

00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:55,129
Nexus 5 have a and SN 8 9 7 4 port and

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,610
it was already supported to some

00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:02,330
labeling into mainline kernel 4

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:04,370
so I started by like how can I add

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,680
support for Nexus 5 into mainline kernel

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:10,069
of course that that was a bigger

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,680
technical challenge then I that was a

00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:16,120
really big technical gel and then like

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:20,599
it was a bigger bite then I could chew

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:23,269
so well I added some support well some

00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:26,629
support is basically you get a kernel

00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:29,779
law over the headphone jack and you can

00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:33,909
trace the volume buttons but that's of

00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:37,370
course not useable for plasma burn so

00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:38,419
well due to lack of time and lack of

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:43,130
proper knowledge

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:46,400
I basically shout that project but to

00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:48,290
in this in past year one of the other

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,470
community members managed to actually

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,830
extend the work I have done and they

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:58,160
actually managed to run a fully mainline

00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:01,040
kernel and with the graphics and Wi-Fi

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,190
wireless and so support on the cross

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:08,060
volleyball and then with the help of

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:11,090
community members we we started building

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,520
a debian based system which can run

00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:19,280
along with this mainline kernel work

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:22,640
done by the community members so it was

00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,430
essentially thanks to people who were

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,180
working on it and the communities like

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:32,870
post-market OS and debian community

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:35,810
which was possible thanks to them and

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:39,050
those developers have now managed to

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:44,750
report more and more verses so this is

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:47,330
Sony Xperia z2 and there is also serious

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:51,800
for which I'm not exactly sure of the

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:53,810
model number and there is actually there

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,220
is a so basically now we have an

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:59,390
experimental experimental launch

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,910
experimental root filesystem which can

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,200
be done on such devices which were which

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,680
are already mainline

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:11,770
it uses fully open source message type

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:15,470
instead of the hacked up live Hybris and

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:20,350
actively Bibles so it's a great to have

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:23,480
such open devices in the market and also

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,360
like you might have you might know this

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,500
already so KD community partnered with

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:37,250
the purism to they will deliver m5 and

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:38,300
agreed upon to sue and we per the peer

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:43,060
ISM computers

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:45,560
Renee campaign which was successful and

00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:49,730
her KD community of free to support

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:53,270
cross Mogollon Librium file and so it's

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:56,279
expected to see in January 2019 and it

00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,740
it also uses a full email lying

00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,170
colonel and fully open source drivers

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:05,370
and in addition to light it also

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:08,610
supports in switches concept which is

00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:14,839
essential to privacy and security Colby

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:19,470
as a curricula community have set up so

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:24,360
I talked about devices and here are some

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:27,240
of the pictures so it says Sony

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,899
experience as I talked about it's

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:36,329
running mainline kernel rosin and plasma

00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:38,819
ball on it a sore neck this is another

00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:43,230
CA device running a Porsche market OS

00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:47,279
and plasma ball and here is another

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:51,420
device c-plus menu while 'next sorry not

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,389
Nexus 5 and of course there is the

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:58,410
prisms development board which is

00:11:54,389 --> 00:12:02,189
already which is also running a does no

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:04,680
one so when we started plasma mobile

00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:07,740
project essentially we were using Levi's

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:12,899
present we well we we didn't actually

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:15,500
explore the opportunities to at that

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:18,959
point we didn't actually explore the

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:22,139
possibilities to have a open devices but

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,790
now we are we are now due to community

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,970
members and the corporation's we are

00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:29,519
actually in the position to build upon

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,920
the open devices and have a plasma while

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,350
running on such devices one of the

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,600
interesting fact about such devices is

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,360
it makes a development so much easier

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,620
because old status oops host that is

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,639
familiar you have a same NASA stacks you

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,259
have a same drivers you have a same

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:53,089
wireless Traverse and you don't have to

00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:57,209
deal with deal with the system which

00:12:53,089 --> 00:13:01,019
basically where you run a endured in

00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:03,209
inside the where you run minimal Android

00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,110
inside the container and talk to pick

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:08,950
through various IPC and you try to

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:16,090
convert chill abs-cbn

00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:19,870
course is called to Siskel's to the to

00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:22,480
the Android Bionic based system and if

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,750
this will also make it so much easier to

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,990
have multiple distributions to support

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:34,000
mobile devices currently we just have a

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:37,690
row for example union based reference

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,640
system on the plasma mobile but if we

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,100
are we are going to follow such open

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,950
standards which are already getting used

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,590
on - doc devices it will make it very

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:50,830
easier for other distributions like

00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:56,350
Debian or are clean of salts who pursues

00:13:50,830 --> 00:14:01,870
a to build upon and of course we need

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:04,390
help so you can ask you can talk to us

00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:07,780
in the metrics channel because mobile

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:13,480
network store and many English there is

00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:15,760
a plasma of electron we need help on

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,590
various topics for example mainlining

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:22,810
such a new devices and we also need her

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,180
so far we have successfully running male

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:30,340
anchor on the only Qualcomm to voices

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:32,800
but that is effort to have a MOLLE

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:36,520
pasted reverse-engineered graphics

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,910
travel Lima so we need help with such

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,850
devices as well the there are all there

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,430
are there is also a community it's so

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,970
which can help you get started on

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:53,590
mainlining your devices and also we have

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:56,080
a post market OS project who have a very

00:14:53,590 --> 00:15:02,880
calm very good guide on how to mainline

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:02,880
your device and yes before

00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:19,029
[Music]

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:39,470
[Music]

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,470
[Music]

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,460
[Music]

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:30,490
[Music]

00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:17,690
[Music]

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,609
[Music]

00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,650
[Music]

00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:26,940
and statistics and restate it says check

00:18:35,460 --> 00:19:20,800
just it's just yeah all right do we have

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:21,670
any more questions I'm wondering if

00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,280
truthiness

00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:27,420
actually maybe you meant the sony xperia

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,830
x device which was the unknown set

00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:33,400
because for that one the hardware is

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:36,820
pretty open and sony documented a lot of

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,070
stuff and i'm also wondering do you

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:45,280
think about joining efforts with the

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:49,000
Sailfish people about joining the

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,440
efforts of shellfishes people I think in

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,550
a party

00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:57,330
I mean like it's a thing of past year we

00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:01,960
started a collaborative effort with

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:04,840
selfish ways and namo mobile and to

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,980
touch people this is called a Harlem

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:14,980
it's a separate to plasma coil so it

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:18,010
works on a solution to use so it works

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:22,630
on a solution to use plasma on basically

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:26,910
those old hardware that only Android can

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:29,380
be used so yes we are basically

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:33,670
collaborating with the selfish ways but

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:35,710
as far as I am aware they are they are

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,320
not putting any effort in the mainlining

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:40,950
devices basically so my current

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,290
presentation was about mainlining device

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,230
basically you get to use very resent

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:59,550
gonna like 4.18 or 4.19 and not the

00:20:46,230 --> 00:21:07,170
vendor provided 4.4 or 4.9 are we on

00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:09,030
time moral there's a reason why he talks

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,280
a lot about Linux low-level stuff and

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,440
why he's in charge of that and why does

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,880
this sort of read separation of where

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,810
does the plasma stop when register

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,740
mobile and right

00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:22,290
so I hack on plasma the way plasma is

00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,750
architected is that we have a single

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:26,880
executable called plasma shell which

00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,590
loads the rest of the UI from a package

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,390
which means if you have a system that

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,730
has best Michelle installed on it in

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:35,010
theory as a third party you can install

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,980
an entire different UI into that system

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:40,620
right so this is then why we call plasma

00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,930
desktop and plasma mobile not because we

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,760
like lots of keystrokes but because in

00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,800
our minds those are kind of separate

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,870
plasma it's the runtime it enables you

00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,760
to write UI targeting a specific form

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,830
factor and desktop for example is a

00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,680
project that implements a desktop UI

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,420
thought that and plasma mobile is two

00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,700
things it's also a project to implement

00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:02,550
a device specific user interface but

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,860
it's also our effort to bring the plasma

00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,720
runtime to mobile devices and all of the

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,700
steps that go into that like device

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,010
image creation and so on which is the

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,840
expert 4 which is kind of why he focuses

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:16,830
on that now under your eye side of

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,720
things we know some of the things we've

00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,310
done in the last year we had an

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,320
optimization sprint where we work very

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,820
hard on making this runtime more

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,570
performant on low powered air and

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,910
hardware for example the target device

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:33,120
that we started with at the start of

00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:35,160
that sprint which was a full week 2 log

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,590
2 compressing the power button to get

00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,090
into the UI at the time we took 34

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,160
seconds at the end of the Sprint it was

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,800
down to 12 or something like that and we

00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,410
cut memory usage by I think one and 50

00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,810
megabytes and stuff like that so on the

00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,060
runtime side of things we've worked very

00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:53,170
hard to target a lower power envelope

00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,210
then

00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,450
a lot of the work that we're doing right

00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,670
now are in kirigami kirigami is a KDE

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,250
framework it's a user interface toolkit

00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:06,070
that extends cute and cute quick what

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,530
Kodama provides is stuff to make your

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,330
applications convergent which means that

00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:13,420
with one code base you can target both

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,460
desktop and the mobile form factor and

00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,770
we've been working for example on

00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,480
porting KDE system settings application

00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,210
to kirigami and other modules in there

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,460
to make them available on mobile we also

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,860
see more and more of our KD applications

00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:29,350
support to Kagame or EDI ami based

00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,900
interfaces so as time goes on more and

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,790
more applications pop up on the plasma

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,780
mobile device image and become more

00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:40,480
usable on a mobile form factor so the

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:43,560
shell specifically there has been some

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,540
polish it needs much more work for sure

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,520
so the way it works is that there's nice

00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,020
very very plugin oriented everything

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,500
that you see on screen is in fact a

00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,840
plugin

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,400
even the notion that you have a desktop

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,730
for example on the desktop or that you

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,290
have a panel is provided by a plugin the

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,910
plugins are made aware of their

00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:02,500
constraints and they can adapt to them

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,330
this gives you the ability to do

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,040
something like use one code base to

00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:09,250
provide desktop icons but also have a

00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,930
file popup on your panel right so what

00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:13,150
we do is we reuse some of the existing

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,740
UI bits we have on the desktop in the

00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,740
mobile shell like for example the

00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,690
Network Monitor UI and to pick your

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,340
Wi-Fi or pick your connection is reused

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:26,650
in the mobile shell but adapts to the

00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:30,100
form factor a bit what this is giving us

00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,630
is is a useable basic system that shares

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,150
a lot of code it needs a lot more work

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,490
to be polished specifically that fan

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,610
factor which the framework allows for

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:41,770
you can on a file basis and on a per UI

00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,920
screen basis you can swap in from

00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:48,010
practice specific qml files and that's

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,410
work that is ongoing as well so that's

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:53,290
like a short overview of what's going on

00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:56,110
on the UI side and I think we're very

00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:59,080
excited to see more more apps work on

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:01,240
the mocha form factor and as they pick

00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,100
up Kagame to do that kya me also gets

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,650
better which then creates this

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,580
fortuitous cycle where it becomes more

00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:14,110
more appealing

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:17,340
report your application to Konami okay

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:25,450
thank you very much it was very

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:29,529
interesting in my mind we have a plasma

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:33,100
boiled off on the Monday so if you want

00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:35,380
you can stop by it's a 3-1 one people

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,890
and at 10:30

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,890
