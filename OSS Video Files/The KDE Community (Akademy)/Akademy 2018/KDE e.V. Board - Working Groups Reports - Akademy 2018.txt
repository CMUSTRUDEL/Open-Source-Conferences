00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,540
[Music]

00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:41,590
was something that I was learning we're

00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,590
learning

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:05,540
[Music]

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,350

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,470
[Applause]

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,650
[Music]

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,650
we are

00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:06,969
those boxes are set

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,269
[Music]

00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,490
[Applause]

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,149
[Applause]

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:23,170
I never lose likes because I just spend

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:24,700
hours getting to stop so we had five

00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,220
cases that I can talk about a public

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:35,760
because they took place in public either

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:40,770
on lists fat hair or absorb we a

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:47,620
conflict between the release manager and

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:52,900
of the protein and that is that's so

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:55,740
this is from municipal problems between

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,740
vdg

00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:05,750
that had better ever we there was some

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:09,560
soul-searching on outside and Tomas

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:15,590
spoken listen to some people and I think

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:17,840
I think things are very we had a case

00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:20,900
that was a little body a maintainer

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,820
brought it to us however we found that

00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:27,830
the maintainer was the one who had been

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:32,390
rude to the by the quarter and that is

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:37,190
only we had a death in the community

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:39,010
which is sad marker Keenan has died and

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,260
assisted men and disabled me account

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:44,870
personally I think we ought to send a

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:50,780
card or something to the family if

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:53,840
that's no the year began last year with

00:09:50,780 --> 00:10:02,540
a huge discussion about a teach at

00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:05,480
solutions IRC matrix Rakesh at other

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:30,440
solutions and there was lots of

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:35,630
discussion any questions there will be

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:38,080
more and then meeting the wind things

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,080
that we can't

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,350
we need more people to doctors

00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:33,610
we're always willing to meet in person

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:37,360
at Sprint's and other meetings had some

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:42,899
things so seriously one of us would have

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,899
to fly somewhere but say something sir

00:11:51,750 --> 00:12:01,529
I mean will will talk the I don't know

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:06,779
something free face-to-face or non free

00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:09,180
that's all that's okay it's sometimes

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:11,279
great intimidating we need to talk to

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,939
somebody that they see is in an hour

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:19,589
I'd say myself is in power I see myself

00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:22,379
as more of listening here and you take

00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:26,300
things into consideration I believe my

00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,300
fellow team members feel the same way

00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,470
well from when I first came in was right

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,830
after a major fork things have

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:59,150
definitely caught better but that

00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:02,070
doesn't mean that that even people who

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:04,890
are friendly with each other also have

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:08,400
conflicts and sometimes they may not

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:13,380
have the tools to come to an agreement

00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:16,160
and sometimes they're so invested in the

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:20,840
issue that they don't see that their own

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:24,840
conduct is a problem that actually is

00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:29,340
really common because humans are humans

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,769
I think I'm out of time so talk to me

00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,769
privately

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,769
Oh

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,389
[Music]

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:10,130
even our you talk about the traction

00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:11,660
 oh well I'm not gonna do it I don't

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,930
know who could be the person to choose

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,930
back

00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:25,519
[Applause]

00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:41,949
all right

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:45,059
[Applause]

00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,059
[Music]

00:15:45,110 --> 00:16:38,509
because it is

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,670
[Music]

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,480
by

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,930
[Music]

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,339
[Music]

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:15,500
we based on performance of the piece

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:15,500
here and we try to predict

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,289
life support

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,150
our

00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,460
[Music]

00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,849
[Music]

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,709
[Music]

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,869
[Music]

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,609
[Music]

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:15,630
[Music]

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,630
yes

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,779
[Music]

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,720
[Music]

00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,610
Hey

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,630
[Music]

00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:48,800
thank you so yeah what we are what we do

00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:52,130
so the the advisory boards is basically

00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,290
a formalization of Kennedy's alliances

00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,990
both in the commercial and

00:25:54,290 --> 00:26:00,770
non-commercial of the saucer ecosystem

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:03,500
and the advisory boards working group

00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:06,170
consists of contact persons for each

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,660
member of this advisory board we did

00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,280
this so that the passive board members

00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,080
wouldn't always have to come to the

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,030
whole advisory board with everything

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,800
that they every question that they had

00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,510
or every input that they wanted to give

00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:22,070
but that every organization can have

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:25,700
their own specific contact and yeah that

00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:27,170
each member of the group is they are

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,710
responsible for one advisory board

00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:33,500
members where they are open for inputs

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,270
and questions and also getting them in

00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,400
touch with other parts of the community

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,110
for example yeah if someone has a

00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,990
specific question about a specific

00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:44,620
project Pacific application then their

00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:48,230
contact can get them in touch directly

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:53,150
core members are alleged david icke a

00:26:48,230 --> 00:27:00,860
radio Cayenne Google Lydia Sebastiao

00:26:53,150 --> 00:27:03,230
continuous Tomas and me yeah what have

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:06,470
we done over the past year we had five

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:09,470
advisory board holes which is always

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:13,310
there with all the advisory board

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:16,430
members and the contact it's usually not

00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:18,740
everyone can make it to the same time so

00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,960
because some some of the advisory board

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,690
members do what they're doing within

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,090
their work time others do it within

00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:26,650
three time so we are alternating times

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,450
between afternoon/evening so that

00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:32,590
everyone had a chance to come at least

00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:34,390
and be second meeting and we have

00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,400
welcomed two new members to the advisory

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:41,260
boards private Internet access and

00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:43,830
Debian and yeah they are currently one

00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,820
of the things that we've done was

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:49,360
coordinating a letter calling on

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:52,120
politicians to accept all three software

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,850
repositories from requirements is canon

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,600
filter so this is maybe you've heard

00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:00,310
about this new you copyright directive

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:05,730
and one of the the articles in it

00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:09,630
article 13 as everyone who holds

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:12,610
anything where users can can upload

00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:15,580
things have to filter them for any

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:18,100
potential copyright infringement and

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,380
this will be pretty hurtful for open

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,910
source communities because we yeah we

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,070
don't have the the staff or the

00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:27,730
technology to do this kind of filtering

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,830
and we also don't want to do that so we

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,270
have partnered with several of our

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:35,710
partner organizations within the

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:38,170
advisory boards to yeah draft and and

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:41,140
signed a letter together to politicians

00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:45,670
to make an exception for all of open

00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:48,790
source and yeah some some lessons

00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,950
learned so we have tried to figure out a

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:53,610
good schedule for the advisory for calls

00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:56,740
we try to do them every two months and

00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:59,290
we realized that we didn't really have

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:02,350
enough interesting topics to make every

00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:04,630
core worthwhile and realized that people

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,180
were seemed less and less motivated to

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,880
attend every call so we went back to

00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,980
forum on schedule

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,270
hoping that we will now have enough

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,610
topics

00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,970
yeah to me really make those interesting

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:19,500
and one positive thing that we've

00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:22,710
learned was that we were actually

00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,950
surprised by the by the impact that's

00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:28,800
the the news of Debian joining the

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:32,160
advisory board actually had in the face

00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:35,700
of Baker system with users with people

00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:39,270
on on forums on reddit with news outlets

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,100
about Linux and open source so for us

00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:43,860
Debian joining the advisory board was

00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,710
Morris geography we like to judge each

00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,750
other we have different missions and it

00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,670
was just coming natural to us that

00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,970
Debian should be on our advisory board

00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:56,610
but yeah for for the world outside of us

00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,500
it was really big news what rule what is

00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:01,050
happening with what will this mean will

00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,450
Debian a switch to plasma is default

00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:06,450
desktop that was that was pretty

00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,890
interesting edge saw that just being on

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,990
the advisory board actually means

00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,830
something and not only for us but also

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,830
for the outside world

00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:21,900
yeah where we need help we're currently

00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,420
trying to find more closely what the

00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,910
Advisory proper do and also watch the

00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:30,360
advisory board working groups to do so

00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:32,850
yeah if anybody has has any input on

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:38,010
what could make the advisory boards

00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:40,860
really useful then happy for it our key

00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:43,530
goals and plans yeah does that want to

00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:47,190
define more closely the the duties of an

00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:49,320
advisory board contact so that people

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,390
really know what's expected from them

00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,590
from them we also want to do more of

00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:57,080
these joint initiatives and actions like

00:30:54,590 --> 00:31:00,960
attack with the data to the

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,490
competition's but yeah that was the only

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,799
that we did and we think that there's

00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,539
still a lot more potential and of course

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,510
we want to grow all the advisory board

00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:10,230
for others also if anybody as has ideas

00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,270
Forgan ization

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:16,440
that should join the advisory board and

00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:18,659
you are also happy for that yeah you can

00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,640
you can reach us under this email

00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:22,640
address yeah

00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:56,080
yeah one of the discussions that we had

00:31:49,659 --> 00:32:00,070
was that Sousou came to us saying that

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:03,010
our their schedules of updates don't

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:06,580
really match with with all schedules and

00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:08,890
also that we didn't have any long time

00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,520
supports long term support version for

00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,220
plasma

00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,950
so those always had to decide should

00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,690
they work what plasma version they

00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,620
should include in their releases and

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,860
then what to do

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:24,580
because we wouldn't or Yasmin only had

00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:26,110
six month support schedule so they had

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:29,169
the problem that they always had to beg

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:31,780
for fixes from later plasma versions and

00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:34,630
so we yeah we try to find a solution

00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:37,710
that the plasma LTS is basically what

00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,710
