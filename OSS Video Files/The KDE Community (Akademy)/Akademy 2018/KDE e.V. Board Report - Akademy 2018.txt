[Music]

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:20,779
[Applause]

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,680
[Music]

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:51,350
acute company canonical and private

00:03:46,170 --> 00:04:08,730
Internet access and we have bascomb and

00:03:51,350 --> 00:04:13,080
PDA be as supportive of other alight

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:16,889
from with an ecosystem yeah can advise

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,900
us on strategic metals and we exchange

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,510
ideas with them there will also be a

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:26,400
bigger report about what the Advisory

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:32,900
Board does but I can say that we have

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:39,229
this private Internet access joining as

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:39,229
sponsor and Debian joining as a new yeah

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:56,180
then we also have if your but if you

00:05:52,510 --> 00:06:04,390
really did make sense for my biases

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:04,390
relationship so we have period

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,090
all right Kenny also hot

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,810
[Music]

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,309
[Music]

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,860
[Music]

00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:20,809
we think we are very happy that promo

00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:23,539
has become a thing again specifically it

00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:26,509
has become an institution that others in

00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:28,759
the community can call upon and rely on

00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:30,879
to get things done quite similar perhaps

00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,769
to houses edwin has worked previously

00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,479
where we are already accustomed to being

00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:37,579
able to reach out to sysadmin to get

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,069
help with something and we know what

00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:43,699
this admin can do for us it's become the

00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:46,579
same thing with promo we have managed to

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:49,449
establish processes we know when to

00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:52,189
invoke promo and what they can do and

00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:55,369
they have become a well-oiled machine

00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:59,329
in publishing stories for the community

00:07:55,369 --> 00:08:01,039
about our accomplishments and I think

00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:03,889
we've seen the results in the feedback

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,649
we get from the wider ecosystem and also

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:08,419
starting from outside the immediate free

00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:11,979
software bubble which is something that

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,979
we're still going after so

00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:19,009
now next year we want to have Academy

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,889
again of course we put out a call for

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:24,740
locations very shortly after last year's

00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:28,849
Academy so far we haven't received any

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,460
submissions that's a bit bad but it's

00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:34,819
also not untreated

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,319
it's not unprecedented and we expect to

00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:39,529
get some so very soon

00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:42,079
and perhaps for the first time we've

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:43,940
made it very explicit that we are open

00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:46,430
to locations outside of Europe as well

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,470
this has technically - in the past at

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,529
this time we decided to include it in

00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,690
the call for locations we think we're

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:57,319
ready as a community and also our

00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:11,620
funding situation allows for it so yeah

00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:13,670
we hope that might happen now Springs

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,750
this is another thing that has gone

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:20,690
quite well the number of Sprint's we as

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,329
a community organized and held last year

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:27,440
is up again which is has been great to

00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:29,899
see we've heard good things from the

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,350
people who have held sprints people seem

00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:35,750
to be happy with how it's working next

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,490
year we expect this to continue in fact

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,610
we might even have more sprints than

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,970
this list namely all our goals Quinn's

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:47,949
are upcoming either in the second half

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,949
of this year or perhaps early next year

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:45,830
and also there are a lot of conferences

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:50,750
the by ourselves but we have a sort of

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:55,790
process process in him in the last year

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:58,700
we had so where we started to have a lot

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:02,900
of TV presents mostly in some

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:05,350
conferences that take place in those

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,350
places

00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:27,759
so last year we had to fundraising

00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:30,629
campaigns one was for the runners prints

00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,699
and one was the end of the year campaign

00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:36,069
they both went very well

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:40,089
Randa came close to anything its goal

00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:41,709
the end of you campaign did very well we

00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:44,709
want to specifically thank lace for

00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:46,269
putting a lot of work into that the

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,339
fundraising campaigns are also an

00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:50,290
example of what we just talked about on

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:52,180
the promo site we've seen our

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,149
fundraising working group work together

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:58,779
with the promo community to get our

00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:01,269
campaigns out there and yeah that's been

00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:02,769
working very well and it went better the

00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:04,930
second time than the first time and we

00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:09,249
expect to expand upon that with future

00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,870
campaigns then we got an unusually large

00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:14,139
donation last year from the pineapple

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:16,269
fund who is an anonymous guy who racked

00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:19,240
up lots of money using Bitcoin and

00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:24,480
decided to spread some of his wealth to

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:28,470
many free software and other we culture

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:32,500
organizations we got $200,000 from them

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:34,750
this hasn't increased our income

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,480
dramatically and has posed us with the

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,209
challenge of how to spend money which is

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,779
an ongoing discussion with the IDI

00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:46,240
membership we have gathered feedback

00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,949
from the membership on and from the

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,649
wider community for that matter on what

00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:54,430
they would like us to do with that money

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,589
and we have a decent set of ideas and we

00:12:54,430 --> 00:13:00,040
are in the process of realizing them

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:01,779
together with the membership we have

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,639
managed to bring more people than ever

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:06,220
to Academy this year with travel support

00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,439
and we have been able to fund the

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,509
Academy social event also better than

00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:15,209
ever I can't confirm that will have

00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:15,209
pineapples there but that work we also

00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,410
yeah other things we talked about is

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,420
putting some money into improving our

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,860
documentation efforts in a similar way

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:28,810
perhaps as we've done with promo and

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,130
yeah we'll see what results are in the

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,779
coming year it's going to be quite

00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:36,339
exciting it's also a new thing for us it

00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:39,190
represents the EB scaling up its

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:41,829
activities which is always it involves

00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,220
learning and discussions going to be

00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:44,220
interesting

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,410
publish

00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,770

[Music]

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,809
