Title: Kai Uwe Broulik - Plasma Browser Integration - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	With a significant portion of the user's time spent in applications outside the realm of Plasma, namely most web browsers, there's a need for better integration of those applications into the shell. Plasma Browser Integration provides media controls for websites, download status, KDE Connect integration, and more.

[Music]

00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,199
[Music]

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:28,890
so actually all of the measurements

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,860
[Music]

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,599
[Music]

00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,649
[Music]

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,399
[Music]

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:26,780
but Harkin is not really so how does

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:30,170
actually that this graph I put up all my

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,200
open offices around skills and you have

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,709
a thing at the top left you have the

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:40,400
catalog website whatever then there's a

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:43,810
country suit that we as women is

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,810
injected into the website

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,199
[Music]

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:42,210
so not going to use the emails we have

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:47,099
two upcoming leaders for some future

00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:50,930
releases place so that if you right now

00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:54,289
start controlling this way we can easily

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,289
start a video

00:04:55,089 --> 00:05:00,249
and then that's a list of features that

00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:04,719
also came up which are not that easy to

00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:07,029
implement because you cannot relate from

00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:10,929
the extension with actual video of the

00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:14,909
universe' so I can like an extra window

00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:23,439
for activities or find out like

00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:25,679
abilities usually to and that's very

00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,679
