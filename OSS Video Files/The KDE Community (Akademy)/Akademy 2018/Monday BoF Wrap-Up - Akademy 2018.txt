all right everybody welcome to the Boff

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:09,960
wrap up session for Academy on Monday

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,509
August 13th 2018 we've got about a

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,210
hundred people here we had 12 Boff

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,880
sessions today and so I'm going to ask a

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,580
representative from every Boff to come

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,800
up and and give a little one minute two

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,920
minute summary of what you did today in

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,880
your boss and we're gonna start with the

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,489
Konan boss which has ovd who's name on

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,739
it

00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:42,090
every have we got any conan people all

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:44,850
right no cone in today say that we found

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,039
out lots of things are awesomely

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,890
prepared and then complexity hits so we

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,110
figured out yes one git repository

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,390
provides several libraries sometimes so

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,670
we should split into several conan

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,219
packages so that makes things a bit more

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,800
complicated but we might actually end up

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,019
with something pretty nice and hopefully

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,840
make building stuff when you're a new

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,080
contributor much easier and also even

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,869
the actually creating applications and

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,070
deploying them easier potentially so

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,140
yeah it sounds hopeful about a lot of

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,020
work is needed if you have a bit of

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,229
Python time on your hands it would be

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,650
greatly appreciated all right Thank You

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:24,650
Fredrik

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,910
[Applause]

00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,720
next up is the automotive session who

00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,720
did automotive

00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,930
okay that is a camera last year

00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:45,470
we work on identifying the gap between

00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:50,210
where Katy was back then and what we

00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:52,640
need to showcase our software in R&D

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:55,790
automotive environments now this year

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,790
that gap is way shorter and we are ready

00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:06,140
to start working in showcasing Katie's

00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:08,899
software on small devices on Yocto so we

00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,840
have been discussing which applications

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,610
would be interested to showcase we need

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,690
something that works on plasma mobile

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:20,830
that is interesting and also we have

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:27,290
been discussing where we can showcase it

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:31,010
during the rest of the year up to Foss

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,410
them next year so hopefully we will

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,360
start showcasing Katie soft wearing

00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,959
embedded and out emotive environments

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,959
this year

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,770
[Applause]

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,640
thanks Augustin now we're gonna move on

00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:53,129
to the whole day worth of buffs for

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:58,319
Katie ease premier products plans the

00:02:53,129 --> 00:03:02,129
plasma stuff Dave please talk about

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,739
plasma okay so we had a bunch of

00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:17,970
different topics we started with past my

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:20,400
mobile so okay so the boiler plasma

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,609
mobile dwarf we discussed what is

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,069
current state and one of the important

00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:27,780
points to discuss is how to recruit you

00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,340
members for the plasma buy because

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,359
currently it's very low on the

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:36,030
contributor side and we basically

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:39,060
discussed some more bits about on the

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:43,099
technical soil like using bundles on the

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:48,840
mobile and I think the discussions were

00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:51,329
met there if useful then we moved on to

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,930
serve our Whalen topics as discussion

00:03:51,329 --> 00:04:00,659
about screen sharing from yon wave that

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:02,699
really worked become funky well in

00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,609
topics several different protocols for

00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,720
input and screens and scaling people

00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:09,409
talked about some of the other issues

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,599
that we need to address that came into

00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:13,729
giving us a lot of - duze I'm not a lot

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,500
done

00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:18,659
after lunch we came back to discuss some

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,750
more of your long-term bigger picture

00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:24,210
topics we discussed the talk I gave

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,789
yesterday about moving some parts after

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,830
process and where we go that came on - a

00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:31,849
lot of good ideas of things to explore

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:37,800
and some new discussion points

00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:40,849
afterwards afterwards like every like

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,430
above of every single Academy since a

00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:52,469
decade or so we talked about activities

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:55,529
and virtual desktops so since now we

00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:56,220
pretty much have to have to redo the

00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,890
work for

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:04,010
the support in Wayland both for visual

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:08,370
desktop and activities we are looking

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:13,950
about ways to either merge them or make

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:18,240
them work better together good news is

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:25,590
that we will have virtual desktops back

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:29,100
in Wayland for 514 then after that we'll

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:35,210
start to look into activities an

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:38,910
interesting thing as every time we did

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:43,080
we did a little polling of the of the

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:46,380
people present that were that were

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:51,900
attending there and quite some people

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:56,730
were using both virtual desktops and

00:05:51,900 --> 00:06:00,450
activities at the same time for pretty

00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:02,520
much the same the same use case one was

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,130
using only activities and not virtual

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,169
desktops some other were using only

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:11,360
virtual desktops and activities but

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:15,360
these gave us a bit of a better idea

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,700
where to go what to go with the

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,250
architecture and hopefully hopefully

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:24,320
where there will be way more smooth and

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,320
integrated and beautiful for everybody

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:31,669
note will be on the mailing list I think

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:41,800
thanks Dave Bhushan and Marco next up in

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:48,190
that room there was the Hague our human

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:50,070
interface guidelines yeah Keurig human

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,930
interface guidelines both it was

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,460
organized by read my already had

00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,280
to leave so I would just wrap it up

00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:02,229
quickly so we talked about this project

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:05,889
that she initiated we have we had vacant

00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:11,130
the Vicky but now we have it on a new

00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:14,350
address at hig dot k dot orc and you are

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,300
welcome to visited and we talked about

00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,180
like how we could improve it in detail

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,150
so it's a new format and sphynx written

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:25,539
out which proves and many aspects evolve

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,460
how it was before and so we want to

00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:29,350
improve it and teacher it's more and we

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,690
got some feedback but we also want to

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,810
look at the bigger picture of it like

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,700
how can we see the human interface

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,479
guidelines maybe now for the next few

00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,910
years in terms of Jasmine breeze and all

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,400
the applications and you have your

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:48,340
discusses or the designers will discuss

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,260
with us in the vdg meetings tomorrow and

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,260
you're welcome to Changa

00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:00,810
[Applause]

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:09,510
thanks Roman moving on we got a promo

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:17,610
Boff but I guess promo prom was probably

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:19,860
pro mowing thank you hey so in the poem

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,780
above today upon any man I talked about

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,670
everything they did in the year he

00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:27,300
showed us a lot of statistics that they

00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:29,760
pulled from the Twitter the pageviews we

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,920
talked about how to maintain user

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,110
engagement what were the drops for the

00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,169
port where the spikes we also talked

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:40,050
about you know how can we engage and

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:44,010
that was one of the action items do you

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:47,850
charter more tea stores and see how you

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:50,340
we can get more kiddy users what else to

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,560
be discussed I talked about mentoring

00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,300
programs and you know how can you do

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,240
more outreach to the students we talked

00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:04,200
about the plans of revamping the website

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:09,820
and I think that was bad Thank You Divya

00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:12,470
[Applause]

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,060
you're half a minute too late Paul to

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:18,380
give a summary of your own work but

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:23,470
Divya has covered for you ice coming

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:28,760
over round for the wave wave wave

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:33,220
alright Michael please all right so uh

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:36,230
Camila Hilda is a ball for his wave

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,960
multimedia app a music player basically

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,960
and so in that ball we we talked a lot

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,810
about kind of like the focus because

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,750
he's got very impressive vision very

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,640
long reaching scope he's he's already

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,320
got his app working on kirigami so you

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,760
can run it on Android today and he's

00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,160
able to show it and demonstrate it and

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,420
you can run on a plasma mobile today so

00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,580
it's an interesting use case for that

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,580
platform and again he showed us on a

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,860
nexus 5 running plasma while he's also

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,750
talking about back-end stuffs like

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,900
SoundCloud you know and how people can

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:11,810
you know make music together and use

00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,240
free software apps like wave in order to

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,550
share that together so some of the other

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,410
stuff that we talked about is you know

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,970
like kind of approach the the

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,040
intellectual property and copyright

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,830
issues that are inevitably associated

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,280
with anything with music nowadays and

00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,630
kind of you know where the the current

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,160
commercial market has kind of left

00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,380
opportunities for free software to

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,790
develop like try to play music on your

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,240
phone without having you streaming or

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:40,430
without an internet connection so that's

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,720
kind of a high point a lot to do and

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,720
very impressive progress so far

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,950
[Music]

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,950
[Applause]

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,810
thanks Michael

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,519
next up is a category you wouldn't it's

00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,010
hard to believe he's really here and

00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:09,089
that he's really real there's the

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:10,910
sysadmin Boff thanks agian so in the

00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:13,920
sassette member we had a very productive

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:16,410
force on a somewhat lengthy discussion

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,390
about how to handle so seven onboarding

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,350
as well as going over everything that we

00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,510
currently have in terms of

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,279
infrastructure what is easiest to

00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,980
delegate out to members of the community

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,500
without affecting principles around

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,230
trust and security of structure because

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,529
a data is important in very sacred to us

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,630
and we came up with a list of systems

00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,490
and items that could very quickly be

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,839
broken out and which could reduce the

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,329
load on this assessment team so that we

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,920
can focus on doing other items and we

00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:46,500
also came up with a list of other things

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,950
that could potentially be broken out to

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,110
in the long run reduce the issues with

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,720
capacity we have and we also talked to a

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,180
much lesser extent about the identity

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,610
revamp and what's necessary to bring

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,709
that forward and replace the current

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:05,420
platform which now is quite dated and

00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:05,420
has redeemed of its lifetime

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:19,400
Thank You Ben

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:22,910
next up is the fabricator buff so after

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:26,330
migrating to fabricate like two years of

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,950
like that has been two years and there

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,230
were like lots of complaints about

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:35,600
fabricator and lot so people hated the

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:37,520
fabricator at completely so that's why I

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,370
registered essentially this buff to

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,430
gather around some actual constructive

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,350
feedback about what's wrong with what's

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,250
wrong with the fabricator and how easy

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:51,430
that means can solve it or possibly

00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:54,110
forward that discussions to of shame I

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,780
actually didn't expect that much

00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:01,000
audience in my boff and it turned out

00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,000
that the whole room was completely full

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:13,340
but in that sense we get a lot of nice

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:16,120
feedback about how so essentially we

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,980
gathered a lot of nice feedback of how

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,740
what the community's problems are with

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,180
the fabricated and like we also got

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,570
solutions for many of the community

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,580
members problems right on the off so

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:35,940
that's a good yeah

00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:39,730
[Applause]

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:42,130
thanks Bhushan also we have the

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:47,470
community data and community metrics

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:50,860
boss is Kevin around otherwise I will

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,960
give a summary in the KDE community

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,850
we've been using the blue blobs for

00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,950
years the blue blobs have turned green

00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,040
and after that kind of pastel colors

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:03,190
it's about measuring the health or the

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,640
state of our community we've used these

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,680
blue blobs green blobs to take a look at

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,160
who's contributing and how often and who

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,110
is who's busy it's also means of

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,640
detecting when people go away because

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,750
then you can be concerned you can say

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,750
hey where you been

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,500
welcome to your first Academy

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,190
but there's more to measure in our

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,290
community than just that and there's

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,720
more to our lives than just commit

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,630
messages so we've been considering what

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,210
other data sources we can add to the

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,520
analysis tools and how we can extend the

00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:44,710
analysis tools to produce more

00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,580
information about how our community

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:51,400
works so that when people ask us hey how

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,400
you doing we can give a really lengthy

00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:58,260
factual answer all right that was the

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,260
community data session

00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:10,899
then Lydia led the community goals

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:12,480
retrospective she's away anyone else

00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:18,430
want to give her summary of the goals

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:23,110
session is Neil fetus here then no

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:26,740
photos I'm gonna stick you with it so

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:29,740
yeah the discussion involved around the

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,839
three calls that was voted there was a

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,959
discussion about the privacy goal a bid

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,269
and how that could can evolve at through

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:41,380
the years and doing the great adventure

00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:45,730
into our into what what we are doing

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:47,920
because there was some suggestions that

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:52,000
were not communicating enough on that

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,670
goal we were discussing a bit about how

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,610
to think of the goals how do we plan to

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,949
end them or maybe how other goals might

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,620
succeed them in the future and how do we

00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:05,380
decide that one goal is complete and one

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,470
is not and we talked a bit more on each

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:11,350
goal and what we can do going forward

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,720
and it gets to the important goal and in

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,750
regards to them

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,140
usability goal and we we shared also

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,630
some problems we found so far in in

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,850
terms of tanks achieve these goals what

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:26,709
we see well what are the areas we can

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,620
improve and what are the areas that we

00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:31,510
did well and we need to continue doing

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,050
and that's what comes to mind no

00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,050
actually

00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,709
and of course it's good to have goals

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,050
but and the end we need to get our

00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:47,959
software out there and that's why we had

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:50,779
the distro Boff which got all the

00:16:47,959 --> 00:17:01,339
distros together to talk about our

00:16:50,779 --> 00:17:05,899
common goals and common issues okay so

00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:10,130
in this drop of first we had lightning

00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:12,860
talks introducing nine distros featuring

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:16,549
KDE some smaller ones and some large

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:19,490
ones and then with an hour of discussion

00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:24,799
where we discussed some of the issues

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:26,750
that we are facing all together and one

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:31,220
big topic was how to deal with back

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:33,799
reports how to get users to fire code

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,830
back reports and how to get them off

00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:39,620
stream when needed because most of

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,480
because very often they end up sticking

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:48,700
in around in the downstream back

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:52,279
distribution back trackers and and

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:55,789
another issue is also how to get

00:17:52,279 --> 00:18:00,260
distribution developers more involved in

00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:05,990
upstream and upstream development what

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:08,540
can we do for that you want to add

00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:14,120
anything more

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:15,290
I would just say that a lot of people

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,850
thought that we were gonna fight and

00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,850
instead we're all collaborating so

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,110
[Applause]

00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,750
thanks Kevin

00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,310
that wraps up the ball frapp up for

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,240
today I'll see you all again tomorrow

00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:35,830
morning at 9:30 for another session of

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,830
