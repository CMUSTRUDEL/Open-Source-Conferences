Title: Aditya Mehra - Mycroft AI on Plasma Updates: Mycroft on Plasma Mobile & Privacy - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	Modern-day proprietary digital assistants are popping up everywhere as the proliferation of smart devices are increasing having a substantial impact on how user data is handled which potentially blurs privacy lines. Mycroft AI is the Open Source alternative that puts the end-user in control of their privacy and provides complete transparency on how user data is used. This presentation will showcase a demo on some of the most the recent improvements and developments in the Plasma Mycroft project and also give a quick preview on Mycroft on Plasma Mobile project. This presentation will discuss and demo how a privacy-centric intelligent digital assistant can further enhance your KDE Plasma desktop experience via voice interaction and further touch upon how Mycroft puts you in control of your data.

Mycroft AI is an open source community committed technology that ties natural language processing, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and powerful APIs together to create a powerful experience allowing users to manipulate their devices through voice control. Mycroft AI is the digital implementation of a modern day virtual assistant on the Linux Platform that can help a user conduct a multitude of task via voice/text.

This talk will also include how users can decide what data to share with Mycroft Skills and how the community can volunteer to improve Mycroft's Open Datasets.

	00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:14,759
hey good hi good morning everyone and

00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,430
today I'm going to be talking about

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:22,860
of plasma micros updates and where my

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,539
coffees at on plasma currently so in

00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,960
this talk I'm going to be talking about

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,699
what's new with micro on plasma I'm

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,610
gonna be showing you a short demo of

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:37,470
certain skills and I'm gonna be talking

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,720
about what's next so the first thing I'd

00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:43,320
like to do is introduce about what's new

00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,079
and talk about introducing - cards so I

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,230
know many of you have Android phones and

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,449
you have used the Google assistant or

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,550
Google home and when you open it up the

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,609
first thing you normally see is some

00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:00,930
kind of cards and news so that's concept

00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:03,329
with micro - cards is that you get

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,090
information immediately and urgently so

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,610
whenever you open it you always have

00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:10,850
information cards ready on the on the

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,850
screen

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,500
the next thing that's new with my car is

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:25,140
how the conversation looks like so lot

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,020
of applications are not using

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,150
conversations low context of how chat

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:38,640
applications should look so this is how

00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:41,130
you talk to Mycroft looks right now the

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,020
next thing that's new with the micro

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,180
plasmoid is there's what better

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,340
autocomplete so when you type start

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,560
typing something my coffee is going to

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:57,119
be able to tell you things and at once

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:59,369
that you can ask Mike roster so what

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,550
else is new with Mycroft on Cosmo ice

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:07,170
killed a lot of new skills so some some

00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,360
things that I think last time I shared

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,610
on blog post is that you can do things

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,240
like control activities social moving

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,910
files

00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,160
control your phone via KDE connect and

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,170
expectation so these are some of the new

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,860
things that also that you can get a

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,860
complete list

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:41,609
so show that later so some more cool

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,430
skills are the resort skill and what's

00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:46,469
nearby - these are complex skills that

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:54,230
can't be that Mycroft can do which I'm

00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:54,230
going to be demoing so put the demo

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,599
let's try so whenever you buy some women

00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:12,120
also I guess this is so exciting since

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:15,139
like the Morning Sun was always it's

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,799
give me a second and starting off so

00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:18,799
apparently the old queen

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,270
yeah I know just give me a that's okay

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,810
it's so that you get to meditate and

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,810
concentrate

00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:02,849
yeah

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,780
[Music]

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:37,390
all right so there you have the

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,180
microcosmic please show on screen so

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:45,520
let's start with something very simple

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,520
hey Mycroft tell me a joke

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:01,260
oh is it using the elastica police which

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,260
over if you use

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,650
Oh

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:10,009
let's try that one again okay my fault

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,009
tell me a joke

00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:26,900
so I think doing all of this like on

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,900
stage deserves extra balls

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,750
most of you have probably seen this

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:40,419
working at home on the videos it's

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,800
really awesome stuff okay so since it's

00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,419
not like working I'm gonna show you some

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,419
videos all right

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,840
so this is basically what I asked micro

00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,360
fear was a micro of search recipes with

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,129
chicken lying and honey and you can see

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,560
some cool recipes the micro comes up

00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:27,780
with you can on on you can also see ask

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,270
Mycroft to read the recipe to you and

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:37,050
that's what it's going to do but sadly

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:38,909
the audios not working alright so this

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:44,969
is one of the skills that Mycroft can do

00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:47,159
and what I add else in the den and the

00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:49,460
demo was this is a force mobile device

00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:53,310
that's running the whole microbe stack

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:56,819
locally so the next thing is of course

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,680
doing a Mycroft on Cosmo mobile so which

00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,139
I will be talking about during the micro

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,400
POF session so I would like everyone to

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,599
please compass with my coffee over

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,599
session on the 16th

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,830
we brought me able to show everything

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,830
thank you all right thank you

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,679

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:59,710
talk to us about guerrilla usability

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:59,710
testing so what come Thomas

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:12,840

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,840

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,880
