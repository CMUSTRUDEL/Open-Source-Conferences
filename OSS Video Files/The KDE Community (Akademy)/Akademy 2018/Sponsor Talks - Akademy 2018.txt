immediately bounce back all of us

00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,790
they're awesome

00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:29,770
this also because but there's great

00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,770
sponsoring out that what the thing and

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,710
trusting us we their support

00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,000
I didn't do anything yet yes probably

00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:55,350
most of you have heard about but you

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,350
want to explain yeah

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:10,830
he's doing magic finger acrobatics

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,930
that's awesome so to see I even have

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,840
slides not that it's super important

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,640
yeah cute you kind of know us so I will

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,140
skip over most of that we are doing Oh

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,680
between selling transitions okay

00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:29,620
so we do a lot of stuff that you are

00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,690
also mostly aware of the desktop is a

00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,910
huge thing for us so sometimes people

00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,710
come to me and say you're not doing

00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,300
anything for the desktop that's not

00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,270
quite true that's where a lot of our

00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,280
customers are but we do have a lot of

00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:44,650
exciting things happening there in the

00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,190
store donation which is why we met all

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:51,460
these interesting protocols and there is

00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,860
all this 3d stuff you actually heard

00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,259
automotive a bunch of times at academy

00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,090
now if you think that's exciting working

00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,640
with automotive getting software on

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,190
there that's free software and for

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,259
example also getting them to do 3d stuff

00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:10,690
that's lots of cool stuff going on so

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,520
work is fun we recently had some

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,690
pictures taken in the office so this is

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,380
just to show you it's you should totally

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,330
join us

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:25,000

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:28,269
colleagues in Moscow yeah briefly 2020

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,180
is the year when we aim to release q6

00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:34,209
and you of course invited to shape it

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,420
either as part of the mini community or

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:40,480
of course as part of the few companies

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,220
so consider joining us we have nice

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,670
office

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,020
in Berlin in Gulu in Finland and of

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,040
course a possible no way

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,680
join me there is also to be there yeah

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,220
q6 what's that we're not gonna break

00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,750
things some of you remember q 3 to 4

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,660
that was not fun we see that so 6 would

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,640
be more like in acute 45 we don't want

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,680
it to breakages where we don't feel

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,360
there really necessary we do want to

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,550
clean up the graphics step to better

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,700
than to create the 2d scene graph good

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:18,690
quick with QED for example none of this

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:22,890
is of course decided C++ 17 will be the

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:26,070
base and we actually have last knowledge

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,290
that summer be coming tomorrow and he's

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:32,100

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:36,990
do talk to them talk to me and let's

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:40,490
make cute better yeah more pictures

00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,490
because they are

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,799
and with the current climate situation I

00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:54,329
was swimming since May all the time it's

00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:54,329
awesome so yeah that's it

00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,489
[Applause]

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:13,810
hello all right

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,419
so to reflect on the on the conference

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,970
we've all just attended in the KT

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:21,609
community we work very hard to make our

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,860
software better but as you've seen in

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:26,350
many of the talks you also continuously

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,960
strive to make our community better and

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,030
make our process better because believe

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,949
that's a good tool in and of itself and

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,220
it's something we can apply towards many

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:38,229
different problems a few systems we also

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,620
work very hard to make any software

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:44,080
better but we are also trying to make a

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,750
grain free software company and to learn

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,979
more about that and improve ourselves

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,990
because we also feel that is something

00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:52,690
that can be applied to many different

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,530
problems especially in the past year

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,660
we've focused on winning KD some new

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,220
friends we are very glad that some of

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,070
them have joined us at this conference

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,560
and they're very happy to be here with

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,099
them and we will certainly be here in

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,099
the next year

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,680
you may have heard of them to you before

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,620
well while we may have chosen another

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,410
desktop as our defaults they're still a

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,440
wide and diverse range of users who

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,539
consume your software by activity so

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,880
thank you so much providing that

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,880
software for us I found an interesting

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,710
listening to make the talk just now and

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,840
probably been if you follow me on

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,030
Twitter or master plan I just bring them

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,500
the entire - Australian - they're so

00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:54,599
sharing and step four is something I

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,599
think we can help with getting your

00:05:54,599 --> 00:06:00,449
software out there to more users that's

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:02,759
our job we want to present your your

00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:06,419
software your excellent ad software to

00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,909
many more users so I will be here for

00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:11,539
the next couple of days I would love to

00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:16,099
talk to you about how we can get wider

00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:16,099
users of your software thank you

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:34,789
hey yeah I'm happy to be here this is

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:37,789
around for more than 25 years and from

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:44,440
the beginning and kdd is the default

00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:47,210
desktop I want to use the opportunity to

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,250
thank Nate for the one of the top I

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,300
don't really have any degree when every

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,910
single work yourself

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,770
I think you've anything the 4k TV isn't

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,729
what users need and I think the fact

00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:00,919
that your goal was elected as as one of

00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:04,310
the three goals okay it shows that

00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:06,440
there's a lot of resonance out there so

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,870
keep keep up the one of the world I

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,090
think that aligns perfectly with what

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,889
user needs as well because there were

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,690
exactly these problems we want to get

00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:20,389
our software to users and provide

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:20,720
language so that's one way for we do

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,449
that

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,800
this package hub and telling from the

00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:26,800
popularity of stickers

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:52,139
it's the way so your something gets

00:07:43,380 --> 00:08:03,870
delivered by a package to 15 and so

00:07:52,139 --> 00:08:05,730
that's good finally I have to say this

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:21,229
is a wonderful place to work if you want

00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:21,229
to talk to me so thank you

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,660
next up the colors about tourism

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:48,000
but just briefly explain what we're

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,740
doing problem relates to education so

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,889
what we think is that freedoms tell that

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:58,839
key so the company and I think that

00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:00,760
freedom is absolutely essential and

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,860
especially we believe free software's

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,850
the best which particular all on

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:12,190
digitized also digital freedom and this

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:15,000
reminds very well the community SSL

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,000
which is really great

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:22,209
gives our as company started a 14-2

00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,639
trade market that the computing wants

00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:29,160
the product that protected users privacy

00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:32,320
security and pitch of freedom and

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,570
creative work laptops so you know 50

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,990
inch which features specific features

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,149
that challenge provide these or I shall

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,769
protect these rights and freedoms first

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,870
of all they're Republicans which is in

00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:46,449
development providers by how have

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,980
survived things like the radio's of also

00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:50,410
camera microphone from the system so

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,589
that no one can spying using these

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,589
devices

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,440
which is free software by us firmly

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,050
placed before those who don't know which

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,730
also the disables and most illiteracy

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,850
into management and generative us

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,700
whisper spying on the users and super

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,870
also include a stenographer

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,890
disappointment we used to effect the

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:18,580
would process of death must at least

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:22,750
with each pure Linux distribution never

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:24,610
develop together with communities which

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:29,050
is free software foundation endorsed

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,610
which also features husband and these

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:35,110
are then the current laptop worthless

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:36,970
thirteen engine 50-minute account very

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,010
ambitious project is the hidden file

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,620
which is a mobile communication device

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,540
which was that the same goals that we

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:47,320
follow for the thinnest distribution to

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:50,470
purify water laptops after the original

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,170
periodicity to pay and it was clear with

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:56,560
our content very from final stages

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:59,920
development organization and its really

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,900
ambitious thing and this is based on the

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,060
same Thursday principles as we did for

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:09,300
the software side and also the backdrop

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,300
side here are some screenshots of

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,450
one white computers that appears within

00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,760
social purposes corporations are just

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:22,250
what you need thing and come one at the

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,110
yes especially was one of the postal

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,930
premises corporate corporations when yes

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,480
was still one of the very few and this

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,580
is especially done to ensure that the

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,610
most ethical goals that we share and

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,350
that we have to achieve can make the

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,089
change between the company so these

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,120
chemical sacrifice corporation profit

00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:44,270
and this is the special pieces of the

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,160
process of operation we have the two

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,050
mission and very the costs equal ground

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,260
for two people currently and about

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:53,480
authority development which is why and

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,279
we work very closely together both

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,010
through software communities our

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,990
ultimate obstacle first so we want to

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,959
really work together with you and the

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,550
other free software communities thank

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,330
you very much for having us in here and

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,330
finally the

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:50,490
I got nothing man hello

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,850
so if I'm walking like a bunch of other

00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:56,580
ke people there okay that so we are

00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:01,050
consulting company specialized no sphere

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:06,150
or compute and 3d or gia and things we

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:16,200
obviously for long time on the EKG

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:18,690
community of me all timers so we

00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:23,300
actually glad to see more new faces in

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:26,730
this community this pretty grateful that

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:31,140
I like to point out that last year so we

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:36,480
are this cavern with Mirko and Frederic

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:39,090
are so long timers and we came up with

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,510
that idea of course and that's really

00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:46,620
nice you see that delivering this year

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:49,350
thank you good things happening so

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:54,080
thanks for all that work going on in the

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,080
community and to world domination

00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:11,779
so yeah this is kind of a pole of

00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:15,790
disappointments so here is really

00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:18,949
excited about patents and open source

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:23,679
alright anybody about license compliance

00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:26,660
and all stores copyright troll

00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,970
all this stuff somebody has to do it and

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,949
assess what the only legitimate does

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,319
it's a collaborative patent pool that

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:35,319
through cross-licensing prevents patent

00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:40,399
litigation and a nearly copy virtually

00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:42,230
enabled space so naturally we actually

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,049
don't have a revenue model we are

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:47,329
spending industry money to protect a

00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:50,959
mystery compatibilization that's what we

00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:53,319
are with the smaller sponsoring this dis

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,569
event there's something very concrete

00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:58,819
dkd community can do the implementation

00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:59,720
network on a regular basis every 18 to

00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:03,410
20 months

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:10,429
updates its coverage and technologies

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:11,779
are covered but in older versions since

00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:14,569
we're now just beginning with a new

00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:16,279
cycle of collecting updates i would very

00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:20,149
much encourage maybe someone who works

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:22,129
in who releases in the community to help

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:23,869
me identify the key technologies that

00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,940
should update will freshly include

00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:28,650
analysis of definition by coincidence

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,940
support assistant efficiency very

00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:34,800
important i one of the key dinosaurs in

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,020
this rule I gave a presentation last

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,200
year on what a community needs to have

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,600
like drive and grow and Kevin has

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,230
mentioned with this kind of triggered

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,710
the idea of goals which is great it's

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,570
great to see the results from that two

00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,170
things stand out right we need to be

00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,850
productive communities to have tried and

00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:00,090
we to be ambitious so everything I've

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:03,600
heard in presentation this is kind of

00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:06,960
what we need right it goes can achieve

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,440
but only if we work really hard so good

00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,050
luck with that

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,770
keep going you're doing well and I hope

00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,770
to see you next year

00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:32,410
hello most of you groaning enough now

00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:46,869
cook think let me go very very quickly

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:57,399
about it why we were here should I start

00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:59,199
anyway what a great fine okay so one of

00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:02,410
the one of the awesome things that you

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,199
guys know that I know hopefully big

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,589
corporations are starting to know in in

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,319
in several industries is that with

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:13,000
knowledge you can achieve almost

00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,279
everything and one of the good things

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,199
that we have is that we know a lot about

00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:21,339
the technologies because we basically

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:23,679
created so by working upstream a company

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:26,829
in small company like us we are about

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,740
close to hundred people mostly basing in

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,809
UK Manchester we can go to big

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,179
corporations mostly in the Bennett world

00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:36,460
and industrial world and of the money we

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,820
can go there and really do what they

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,040
cannot do or

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,770
what they've got an affordable price

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,510
because our truck service operator we

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,280
know the technology and we know how the

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:50,420
sulphate she's buying they are very

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:54,800
focus to know about his facts and yep

00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:57,080
and that is possible and that that that

00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:02,140
allow us to do things that many other

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,140
companies just simply character so

00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:09,670
[Applause]

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:15,220
yeah I should make always tell me forget

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:17,200
about the slides so alright so that's

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,330
what we are working up stirring many in

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,130
many in many communities now while we

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,290
are in this one in this particular

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,210
moment so basically I want to talk to

00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,010
you the fog the rest of the recording to

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,040
say basically about two projects that we

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:33,250
are heavily investing on working on the

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:36,220
first one is freeness of SDK probably

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,930
some of you know exactly what it is the

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,560
new version was raised a couple of days

00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,500
ago

00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,480
so whole thing is actively investing in

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,950
that we think it's a good project to

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,020
promote to work on a day and free

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:54,340
desktop SDK is part of our world

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,930
domination vision it's using the second

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,810
project I got to talk to you about what

00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:03,460
sort of doing these days is Bill Stream

00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:05,410
talking has a long history on creating

00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,860
and solving problems related with

00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:11,440
building complex systems that needs to

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,590
be reliable and working for a very long

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,380
time those things be used not just by

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:21,670
predisposed SDK guys but also but also

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:25,809
as was published some weeks ago by

00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:29,620
we don't release the duration P so we

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:33,340
have already in thirst abuse case in the

00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:38,470
open work and uses the tool we are also

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:40,030
popular some people that like to use so

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:44,559
that's another abuse case that is very

00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:47,290
interesting for us and we want to truly

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,540
be an eternity for tools that are very

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,940
popular out there but it has been

00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:55,600
development even more than ten years ago

00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,640
so yeah I would like to talk to you

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,590
about those topics if you are interested

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,809
and obviously like everybody else we are

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,750
growing the whole living solution tree

00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:08,110
is growing like crazy so if you are we

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:12,220
want to the problems of big companies

00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:15,299
things that matter a lot convenience a

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,299
great option thank you

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,380
[Music]

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:37,309
police is coming to every device every

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:40,350
platform and every household globally

00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:42,720
and unlike the desktop software market

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:46,370
and the operating system market the

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:50,160
winners and boys have yet to be chosen

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,620
the open-source community stands to be

00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,320
the leader in this category in the same

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,450
way that has been the leader in the

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,179
server market it's been the leader in

00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:02,850
the web market in terms of dynamic

00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:06,840
content it's been the leader in the

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:09,030
database market my craft AI is the open

00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,550
voice assistant we're building an

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:15,830
open-source voice stack that can be used

00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:18,300
any way desktop automotive mobile

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,400
wearable we're building a voice

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,380
assistant that doesn't represent some

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,730
giant company that's trying to insert

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,800
itself into your life

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:29,640
we're building a voice assistant that

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,290
represents you the user we're building a

00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,140
voice assistant that when the phone

00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:35,309
rings at 10:00 p.m. it will let the call

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,230
through because it's your brother

00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,900
calling to let you know the baby's here

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,090
not because it's a telemarketer that you

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,780
paid the voice assistant company to get

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,760
through your photos we're hoping to have

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,060
the key

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,130
[Music]

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,560
this future a future where voice belongs

00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,510
to the open community and that means

00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,990
building agents that run not only on the

00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:00,180
desktop computer but on mobile devices

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,070
wearable devices and across all of the

00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:05,040
points where we touch technology in our

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:07,050
lives so if you're interested in making

00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,710
sure that there's an open future for

00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:13,140
voice that Amazon Google Baidu $0.10 and

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,850
Alibaba don't dominate this market the

00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,070
way they've dominated every other market

00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:19,320
in technology over the last 10 years

00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,960
please come and volunteer with our

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,300
community help at Yad to build a voice

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,310
assistant stack for the KDE desktop and

00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,830
in the future as we extend the

00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,690
technology to more devices more

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,550
automobiles more wearables and more

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,860
mobile devices be a part of our

00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:38,030
community and help us to build an open

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,030
future thank you
