	00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,480
I hear not

00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,640
yeah so this is my surprise I would

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:20,340
it's pretty cute today but I haven't

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:23,550
like so that was handy so I won't snap

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,500
craft is we want to make it easier to

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,660
deliver software to users it's as simple

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,430
as that we want to make it so that your

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,650
software can get into the hands of users

00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:35,480
quickly and easily so they can get the

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:39,060
latest and greatest shiny reliable

00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,160
usable secure fresh software on their

00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,079
system that's the goal of snap craft

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,579
there's two real terms here that I'm

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,399
going to use a lot money snap craft

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,309
which is the tools we use to build the

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,160
software and snap which is the packaging

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,410
format so a snap can you can think of a

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,269
snap as being very much like an apk on

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,219
Android it's a package that contains

00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:02,670
your software and snap parties the tool

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,949
used to make them now one of the tools

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,950
that we provide a web-based tool we

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:11,550
usually build your software and land it

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,820
on consumer hardware and that's what

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,650
build build up snap craft IO and the way

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,270
you build what's that Gras fireworks if

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,460
you hook it up to your repository

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,290
wherever that may be

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,670
whenever there's a change in your closet

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,340
rate let's say for example don't get

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,380
help every time you push it commit snap

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,329
craft will automatically build it and

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,790
push it to the store now it's not

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,549
mandatory that you use this this is a

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,380
useful tool that we we provide you can

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,180
build using snap crafts on your own

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,490
hardware but this is just one of the

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,040
options is build or snap arpaio

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,509
it's very useful to people just getting

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,119
started especially to people who've

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,710
created with a code thrown out on github

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,090
and now want to build on the next

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:57,329
package they can use this service only a

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,860
snap you drive sucker off with a hammer

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,219
file that looks a little bit like this

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,950
the yellow has a few important sections

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,680
the bit at the top is typical metadata

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,320
about your application so you describe

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,320
it in simple terms version number name

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,170
description and so on and this is a snap

00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,090
craft on the animal for command - cool

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,270
cool offline IMAP so while I'm

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,910
addressing the KDE audience snaps are

00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,250
not limited to desktop application

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,620
you can put a small command-line

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,630
utilities in a stack you can put server

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,180
demons you can bundle lots of things in

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,070
a snap it's not just for desktop apps

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,960
it's not just a server not just priority

00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,790
the goal is the snap to be used for

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,320
anything in this case the little

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,220
command-line utility you'll find oh

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:45,680
that's really cool you know but the

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,420
metadata at the top the next bullet it's

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,250
really important where is it parts and

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,980
this describes us now what goes in this

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:54,440
map and in this case of my map is a

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,130
placement application and snack-off

00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,080
knows how to build Python applications

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,880
so there's a plug-in airline 17 this is

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,370
plugging Python there are lot of other

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,510
plugins that snap craft has that's what

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:10,100
the seam 8q make made Auto tools it can

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,810
build your applications you can build

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,370
just about anything and you can

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,230
overwrite those plugins and if you've

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,970
got a weird esoteric build system you

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,340
can overwrite as well you don't have to

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:24,470
use those onions in this case is piping

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:26,990
open to and that's like the absolute

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,850
minimum you'll need for a snap off you

00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,480
know there's a couple of sections in

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:34,340
there one length like eight confinement

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,230
I'll talk more about confinement little

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,180
bit later but essentially snaps can be

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,540
securely confined so one application

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,460
can't see the files of another or can't

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,800
get access to system resources that you

00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,830
have internet access to and this

00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:52,400
particular application the confinement

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,050
lonely straight and we've also given it

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,490
access to the network because this thing

00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,830
backs up your email it needs to go and

00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:00,680
get your email so line 13

00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:03,080
it uses a club to get out over the

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,560
network and that's all this application

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,739
can do it can't

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,959
the system locks it can't even display

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:13,510
an x window on the screen it is strictly

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,099
confined and this is the target that we

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,489
want is to get every application

00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:20,950
strictly confined so that users have the

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,090
confidence that each application is not

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,240
going to stamp all over your other

00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,590
applications or read or SSH keys or you

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,710
know other things you just don't want

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,150
them to do that's the simple stuff yeah

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,310
more here's another one just to

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,340
illustrate 30 people plugins this one

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,229
uses nodejs so we can build node

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,780
applications but as I said you can build

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:42,580
graphical apps as well if you do use the

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,630
build service every time you do should

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,190
commit we built all those major

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,130
architectures and you can force a bill

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,200
per person to build many but a bet if

00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,810
you just want to force of rebuilds for

00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:00,460
example and you can do that but every

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:02,530
commit will generate a new build from a

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,210
user point of view what users will see

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,180
there's a web-based store if you go to

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,860
that URL in your phone or desktop

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,570
players I thought that's very user like

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,190
browse the store and search the store

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,550
and look for applications and you'll see

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:22,419
some prominent proprietary and some free

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:23,710
software applications in the store if

00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:25,330
you click down on one of those

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,490
applications if we look at the user

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,130
point of view of my own app the thing

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,680
that we built oh yeah you can see the

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,630
name of the application the people who

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,970
publish the application making a

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,729
screenshot or two down here as a

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,650
description metadata and then over there

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:44,530
you can see exactly what version is in

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,510
the store the snap store

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,950
supports multiple versions of the same

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,120
application in the store at the same

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:54,070
time so you could have a version 7

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,229
series of online app and a version 6

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,850
series version 5 series you want to

00:05:56,229 --> 00:05:59,440
support multiple releases the store

00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,000
completely supports that but for the

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,830
opportunity to sink in a case like this

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,110
where there's only one version in the

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,760
store it's that as well it's very

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:12,639
flexible a more complicated example

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,400
known is also in the snap store and with

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,169
note they have

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,960
supported releases they don't just have

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:21,720
only one sort of release and so they

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,810
have these additional what we call

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,810
tracks and these tracks four nine eight

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:30,180
and six and ten whatever other release

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,669
of note that they support that enables

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,949
them to maintain multiple releases and

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:37,470
it allows a user to choose which version

00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,810
they would like so a user can say I want

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,699
nobody and I want to stay on no date I

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,919
don't want to be on ceremoniously

00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,820
upgrade to load nine or no 11 or

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,600
something which might break my

00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:51,600
application so using tracks in the store

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,430
you can support the capability of the

00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,889
multiple releases and support it not for

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,110
these events or another little thing on

00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,760
is really you look makes a little

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,460
nervous or think you'll see a little

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,919
green taking it's a white take on the

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,280
green background but the green tape as

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,080
we call it is the thing that gives the

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,020
user confidence that this so quick came

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,520
from the upstream it's not something we

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,560
do it on the internet and packaged it

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,870
and maybe put some malware in everybody

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,729
in the store so invented this level of

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,610
validation to give the user confidence

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:25,320
that this software comes from the

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,210
original upstream source and if I go

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,760
back to the story see some of these

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,860
roles that have takes a lot to prove

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:37,320
that they came from the original

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:40,260
developer if you scroll down on this

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:44,039
page you see a little map trying to make

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:46,169
the store page appealing so a user will

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,789
have some confidence that not only is

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:49,560
this applications from the original

00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:51,479
developer lots of other people around

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,550
the world that using it as well people

00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,699
live by regionally using it as well so

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,470
this just adds extra data for the user

00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,560
to make that decision about whether they

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,699
want to install this software or not and

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,430
you can see over on the right hand side

00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,979
it even shows a logarithmic bar graph of

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,659
the firm what distributions people would

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,880
install this software on around the

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:14,370
world we don't give them all numbers but

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,030
it gives you some level of you know idea

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,030
of where is he

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:22,039
come on my tools to do browsing the

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,919
store and manipulation and installing

00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,479
snaps so for very same snack I can just

00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:27,710
type of snack in phone no reading

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,780
exchange of the same stuff that's on the

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,750
web store you can have a little green

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,820
taking that suppose that this is a

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,289
verified developer and it showed you all

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,789
the tracks inside the output from this

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:41,870
is actually very long goes down to back

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:43,640
here so there's lots of tracks for each

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,709
of the different supported releases but

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,209
allows you to install the remove snaps

00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:49,100
and manage the synapse on your system

00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:53,330
from the command line and here's the

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:55,160
example on my system yesterday I didn't

00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:00,649
have note installed I just did exactly

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:04,130
still no browsers and then simple as

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,750
that I didn't have to go hunt down this

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,029
application online I don't have to go

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,620
and find some random website or again

00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:12,380
have repo and then downloads and

00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,470
software and install it it's just right

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,110
there easy for me to install it's

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,779
available for lots of different

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:24,950
distributions these are some of the more

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:26,870
popular ones but actually it's simple

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,480
for lots and lots of places these about

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,839
the kinds of places where people have

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:36,230
snacks installed so that myth but it's

00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:38,029
only a bun - not the case right four

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:44,180
people have snapped installed in lots of

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:48,829
different where some of these which is

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:50,930
pretty cool users love new software they

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:53,270
love to go and look for new software

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,980
they'll open the software store browse

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,959
around click on things read the

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,860
description be grabbed it's something

00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,480
they're interested in and then

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,079
installing if they don't like it they're

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:07,579
long installing and we've discovered

00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:10,520
this inner beauty the default desktop

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:13,160
installer is software server isn't in

00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,240
software and it's lying here it is

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,370
editors picks all of those are snaps and

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,110
my team populates that list with

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,010
software that we found in the stepstool

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,740
that is beautiful functional

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,780
as good metadata is kept up-to-date by

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,480
the upstream developer is nice and

00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:34,060
secure because we want to recommend good

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,730
software and how our users and they want

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,280
good software we know if we put an

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:42,100
application in that list users will

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,410
install it it's it's something

00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,560
revolutionary that we learned in the

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,500
last year users will open the software

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,300
store and install applications these

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,730
kind of think users don't do that but

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:56,770
they do they actually do and we can see

00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,800
the stats for an application that is

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,590
snapped and they've got in that list and

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,480
ago the graph goes up when we add to

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:07,000
that list so it's a good place to be in

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,520
that list I want to feature your

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,820
applications in that list I want to have

00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,100
your beautiful functional secure of

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:19,870
today's software in that list to drive

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,330
users to your applications and this is

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,210
what it looks like when we feature

00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:27,250
applications in that list this is a

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:30,160
relatively popular application the

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,780
colors represent the version number of

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,200
the application so what we're seeing

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,990
here is over time yes the number of

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,210
installs goes up you're also seeing is

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,550
the new version supports the older

00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,870
version so users are being pushed

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,240
towards the new version of the

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,370
application and you as a developer not

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,190
having to support lots of really really

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,840
old crusty versions of your software

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:56,320
because the users of English food it's

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:59,380
very short small among the people who

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,330
are still on whatever the software was

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,670
and all the places where their graph

00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,010
does that is when we featured in many

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,590
software or we've tweeted about all

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,320
we've written a blog post about and we

00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:14,020
love doing that that's my job is to

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,790
write blog posts and tweets and promotes

00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,870
of the way so that's why I want your

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:21,490
software to be able to write about here

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,090
are examples of the stupid cleats

00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:27,220
I write on a daily basis applications

00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,279
and people engage with this stuff both

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,160
on Twitter

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:34,100
Google+ people we share this stuff

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,930
people reply they argue with me about

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:41,629
whether ponies should be in the command

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:45,920
line or not so yeah this is the kind of

00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:48,139
you know stuff we do so a little bit

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,269
about the technical side of perhaps as I

00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:52,939
mentioned they're confined they use

00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:55,309
standard Linux primitives like armor and

00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:57,199
set comp to complying application so

00:12:55,309 --> 00:13:00,740
they can't break out of the sandbox that

00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:05,779
they're in to ensure that they stay can

00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:08,749
find it you can when a user installs an

00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:11,269
update to a snap the previous version is

00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:13,160
kept on the system and in the event of a

00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:14,990
failure we can roll them back to the

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,050
previous release and that includes wrong

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,610
their data if necessary as well so bad

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,240
if you put out a bad version of an

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,550
application you can have some watchdog

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,379
in there that determines whether the the

00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,149
application operated okay if it didn't

00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:30,230
roll back to the previous release or you

00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:34,759
couldn't move forward and pushing

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:38,360
yourself Jesus I mentioned channels

00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:40,730
there are four channels edge is a

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,430
channel where we say push the latest

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,439
updates into the store but these are the

00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,959
leading edge updates directly from get

00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:49,610
master and end users usually don't want

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:51,649
that they probably want more stable

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,930
releases and so we have a stable channel

00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:55,279
as well and if you push your application

00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,709
to the stable Channel it's very

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,709
discoverable in those software the edge

00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:01,970
channel is not discoverable software so

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:04,509
we don't want people discovering

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,160
software which is very unstable

00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:08,689
leading-edge changing every day we want

00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,029
to discover stable stuff that you

00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:13,850
support so there are multiple channels

00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,779
the four main ones are stable candidate

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,569
beaten and age

00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:22,250
most people only use edge and stable the

00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:24,110
others are optional and I've also

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,179
mentioned tracks for the example with

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,709
mode you can choose to have multiple

00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:29,660
tracks for supporting different releases

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:33,730
and that allows the user to choose what

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:36,320
version they want to store

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,510
that's why people automatically update

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,000
four times a day a payment on your

00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,950
system will go and check into the snaps

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,480
door and see if there are any updates to

00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,520
your snaps and will just update them

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,770
very much like mobile phones these days

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,740
which automatically update the

00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,750
applications on my phone I have no idea

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,760
what version of Spotify I have installed

00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,890
those no I've got the latest and the

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,380
same on my desktop I have the staff of

00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,510
Spotify installed no idea what version I

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,060
know it's the latest if they pushing you

00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:07,730
update I will get it usually with four

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,250
hours you can defer that if you want to

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,780
so actually on my home machine I don't

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,150
want all these updates coming throughout

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,770
the day so actually I defer it I only do

00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,320
my updates between 4:00 and 7:00 in the

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:21,110
morning you can choose whatever time is

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,730
best used it weekend or some other time

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,560
but the idea is for you to do those

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,570
updates because we don't want these

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,240
devices out in the field with old

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,890
insecure versions of software that's the

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,670
whole reason why this motivation to push

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,620
people forward if you have any questions

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:39,200
and what to discuss this further we have

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,570
a forum we do as much as we can in the

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,820
public both Safdie and snap crafts are

00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,340
open-source their hosted on github you

00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:50,120
can see all the code and meet all the

00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:54,620
team over there and you can try out

00:15:50,120 --> 00:16:01,390
build up snap craft io just on whip

00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:01,390
super easy any questions at all yes

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:25,950
which is about the recommendations you

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:25,950
say that it is a manual were criteria

00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:39,130
that list there yes it's it's very

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,860
simple it's a meeting that myself and a

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,200
colleague have on a weekly basis and we

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,690
look at each application we test install

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,520
them we see if they're updated upstream

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,650
we see if it's owned upstream or whether

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,300
it's owned by some random person in the

00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,350
community we check whether it's got

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,780
update metadata

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,310
whether the license is correct the icon

00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,500
is spray so we have a whole bunch of

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,570
criteria that we run through and if any

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,340
of those are not done like the icon

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,560
isn't right or there's no screenshots

00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,089
will email the developer and say hey

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,400
we'd like to feature your application

00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,230
but we can't because you haven't got any

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,699
screenshots or the license is wrong and

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,320
generally people would just go to the

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,580
store fix all the things that are wrong

00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,560
and then we'll feature them the

00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,480
following week we do that generally

00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,640
every week not while I'm here but

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,640
usually every week we update that list

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,040
[Music]

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:42,310
brilliant question so we can't fully

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:46,090
know what's inside us now because some

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,470
snaps contain proprietary software most

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,930
of them are free software there's a few

00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:53,380
proprietary ones we don't introspect

00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,780
into exactly what is inside the binaries

00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:00,670
that are inside those facts which is why

00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:03,070
we present them with verified tick in

00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,780
try and we try and build relationships

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,780
with developers so that we can vet them

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,210
but we don't guarantee that the snap

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,559
doesn't contain any malware and we have

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,149
had one instance

00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:15,340
a little while back where someone did

00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:17,409
upload a snap that had some malware in

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,409
it was a game and it also had a crypto

00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:22,809
minor built-in tricky thing there is

00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:24,700
crypto noises are not bad in and of

00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,860
themselves and if I put a snap in the

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,499
store that was a crypto minor I would

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:32,379
want people to install it right but

00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:34,659
where they fall foul is they described

00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:37,389
it every game but it had a crypto minor

00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:39,610
in there as well so we obviously have

00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:41,470
terms and conditions and you know we

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,330
would rather you didn't do things that

00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,309
were bad and when we found that

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,409
particular application it was removed

00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,529
from the store within two hours of being

00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:55,179
told what we also did in that particular

00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:57,389
case was we took the software that had

00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:00,100
been published in the store and we

00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:02,590
compiled it cleanroom without the

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,240
malware and pushed back to the store so

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,669
if anyone did have the malware on their

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,139
system we pushed a clean version over

00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:10,840
the top of it to replace the broken

00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:13,570
brush so we do take very care we do take

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,940
that seriously and we do do some scans

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,740
and checks of the things before they go

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,450
into the store but we can't check for

00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:24,629
everything it's a game of cat and mouse

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,629
and we will never you know everything

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,920
