Title: Kevin Ottens - Bringing Community Data Analysis Back to KDE - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-05
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	After Paul Adams retired from KDE to pursue other endeavors, we were left with not much insights left about the health of our community. This talk will explain why and how I decided to pick up the torch. It will also cover future plans and interesting questions to explore. No colored blobs were harmed during the making of that talk.

In this talk we will explore the work previously done by Paul Adams about community metrics. I will explain the code legacy we got from Paul and how I modernized it. This will be the opportunity to demo some of the tooling. I will also explain why I'm not planning to reuse off the shelf solutions for that work.

Next, I will give my own interpretation to the diagrams and metrics Paul was previously producing. This will explain and justify some of the improvements brought to the visualizations that were advertised in the past months.

Last but not least, I will explain some of the currently undergoing work and the questions I plan to explore. There might be crazy plans about going beyond just visualizing what's going on in the community...

thank you

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:16,600
so welcome everyone

00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:19,760
so as mentioned we thought about the

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,820
community that our analysis and bringing

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,620
it back to Katie because it turns out

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:31,100
that something we used to do and then

00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:36,770
stopped so my name is Kevin Newtons

00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:39,770
I'm working for k-dubb to pay bills and

00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:43,250
so I'm doing cuticle switching trainings

00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:46,730
development as a trade and all my spare

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:49,700
time working for the ete community have

00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:53,090
been doing that volume why lately I'm

00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:56,270
not churning much code in KD products

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:59,090
but turns out that through that topic

00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:03,770
I'm running a bit of curds about the

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:07,700
community so let's get back in time

00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:11,180
first maybe some of you you know or

00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:15,320
remember that guy look at that guy

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:18,110
dashing right what a teddy bear you want

00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:23,020
to have him and hug him with it right

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:27,229
we've been happening for a long time no

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:29,060
not for the curdled produced because he

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:31,610
didn't write any code for the KDE

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,770
community really but he had a couple of

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:37,510
strips which he didn't publish until

00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,510
fairly recently as far as I know

00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:46,550
communicating bow the result of his

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:49,280
trips which were mostly this was what's

00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:52,010
called the Blue Bloods but you might

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,420
remember we had one line per contributor

00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:59,750
in and then this came from left to right

00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,180
was time and you would get a small blue

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,040
blob in front of contributor in that

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,100
contributor was active that particular

00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:11,900
week and the more active the contributor

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:13,970
the darker blue blob would be turned out

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,890
when I looked at the code we get back to

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,510
that later on that there were basically

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,000
four layers of activity you committed

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,130
once two times three times or four times

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,890
and then everything else is equal to

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:30,310
after that that was an interesting one

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:34,190
still right because one that we could

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:36,550
see if new people who are joining in a

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,930
particular team or the world community

00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,959
because if you have a graph which gives

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,820
you they're gonna like this with the

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,760
blue Club starting that means new people

00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:52,520
are coming each line right that gives us

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:55,250
an indication when someone was stopping

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,040
right or if someone was between oppose

00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,200
and then

00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,299
bring back so we could be able to see

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,060
these kind of things

00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:12,120
the other type of the other type of

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:17,819
diagram did where those right so he did

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:20,879
also contribute or networks the one not

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,629
repeater and an edge between two

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,819
contributors

00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:29,069
if those contributors collabo eighty

00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:32,220
right and we determined that who commits

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:35,849
that's what he didn't script in the

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,819
commit someone touch the file and in

00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:41,939
another commit and workers and touch the

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:49,349
same file then you would have an edge

00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:52,650
between those two between between those

00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:56,459
two all right so that's a bit of an

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,230
approximation of collaboration but if

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,750
you are looking at the data produced by

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,449
the community which in the case of a

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:10,340
software product is many comets that the

00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:14,519
best thing you can come up with and then

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:17,880
2014 King right 2014 is best least last

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,699
time we seen Paula at an academy and he

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,720
gave a talk where he shared something we

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,180
should look like this

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,080
that was a diagram where I was putting

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,070
over time

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,640
[Music]

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,920
community and CIO the dirt the more

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,900
equation who that so there was some

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,320
noise in there but there was a clear

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:44,120
trend of climbing up all the way up to

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,890
2010 and I need to drop drop again

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,810
what's interesting about cohesion is

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,700
that it's not related to the amount of

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,330
community with a cut flower week right

00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:57,600
it was linked to that are well connected

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,340
that network was how much collaboration

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,830
was happening between the contributors

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:07,590
so that was interesting to see see that

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:10,980
it was the reasons why were still

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:15,120
debating but what I found sad in that it

00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,840
basically started to debate and nothing

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,940
happened right

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,270
we didn't really start reflecting on

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,270
what Oakland and then kind of when the

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,980
recently I thought yeah let's see how he

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,720
did it and maybe we can pick it up and

00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,820
we could try to make those metrics again

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,850
maybe we would get you inside because

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,300
since 2014 we moved on right a new thing

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,300
happened

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:52,950
using good comments from within the

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:57,860
Python scripts and speaking to grab this

00:05:52,950 --> 00:06:00,879
all right I was like spinach or and made

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,339
code right with love

00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,439
the amount of skill that but Adams as if

00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:09,129
you ask me we tell you is a crappy

00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,869
programmer I can say I love all the code

00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:13,839
I've seen them that were good things

00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:15,669
some of those I'm using now extinct

00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:19,990
coming from there there were a couple of

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:23,529
problems on his trips so that were very

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:27,819
slow and our to maintain and extent

00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:30,129
because that was all really and made and

00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:32,649
the fact that he was written practice as

00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:35,169
you put made things very static so if

00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:37,479
you remember I ended up with a PNG which

00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:39,360
was thin thousand pixels wide right

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:43,719
which is not necessarily easy to

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,309
comprehend and ability alright so that's

00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:51,129
pretty much the situation or the weight

00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:54,699
here 2014 and then 2018 becomes an area

00:06:51,129 --> 00:07:02,679
right I'm thinking okay let's revive

00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:04,749
this and she can be in 2018 data science

00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:06,819
where I reckon is about data sciences

00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:08,829
where there isn't I guess his weight and

00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:15,399
so every problem in the world with data

00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:17,139
science yeah if I was even sitting in

00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,019
that room would probably stand up and

00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,969
shout bingo at the point

00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:23,939
yeah it's find out which bingo in the

00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:26,499
data science field in my opinion but

00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:34,659
they developed some interesting tools

00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:37,929
alright in Python which with I used

00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:41,860
three of them many pandas Network X and

00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:43,449
okay alright so pandas is to be able to

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,520
pick two eyes

00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,830
that and then we can actually process it

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:53,259
in Burns instead of having you all for

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:56,620
your own unrolled loop Network X is nice

00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,599
for dealing with protimeter crafts and

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,520
bouquet is nice for switching out the

00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,620
visualization and that's actually

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,009
dynamic HTML so you can actually

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,919
navigate in there and there is also nice

00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:11,439
to which he is named Jupiter which

00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,870
allows you to share on your code faster

00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,719
because you can prototype and run some

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:32,349
part of it again and see how it works so

00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:35,889
that's what I'm looking at inside of

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,699
your order then you get views on I spend

00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:39,550
too much time

00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:47,050
commenting on the code because otherwise

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:50,459
I but the idea is that you can spit you

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:54,370
cotton snippet right and then run each

00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:56,290
individually so that one is longer

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,959
that's actually the part which processes

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:02,610
the get history so I'm looking at the

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,769
World'd history of peeling on the year

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,230
2017 understand better and then we can

00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:11,560
start to learn maybe that what

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,590
Jupiter as well that if you try to put

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,970
one variable when the driver tries best

00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,750
effort we're going to display something

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,700
meaningful which is when you have plenty

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,190
of data like this is nice let me check

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,770
that you have a table which look like

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,770
what you expected because you will get

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,320
so we get this kind of crust right and

00:09:51,100 --> 00:10:09,270
so like what we are you see that's our

00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:09,270
tactic so we can so if I do

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,900
20 and so on right so we can do this

00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,360
kind of in its velocity and if we look

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,850
at the world script I fast me quickly

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,740
now it's fairly linear right there's

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:29,420
nothing I mean you have that I do that I

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:32,810
just do that so that fairly mentally but

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,120
in the end that's very easy to change

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:38,540
things right if I would want you for

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,760
some reason but that makes sense but why

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,760
we want to flip my sanity on the air

00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:56,740
I just when that bit now I have my

00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,100
sympathy fleet and we weren't just

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:04,000
around the rain then I had my chorus K

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,920
which is backward so nicely among change

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,100
aligned experiment see how it feels

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,380
right a very good rule for getting there

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,630
and found that room then you can express

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:18,040
you can stop produce produce stuff like

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:21,340
this so that one that's coming out

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,440
versus team size by Tim sighs I mean the

00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,950
number of people active a particular

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,840
week

00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:33,160
so that's low work and so each

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:39,400
correspond to one sample for a

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:42,010
particular week and then like safety

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,170
data but where we filtered out with the

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,690
I frequency features right so to remove

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:49,390
all the noise and get an idea of the

00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,760
track and interestingly when I run that

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,610
one on all these three we have 4 KB

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,640
which is nice because we do work in the

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,990
KDE repositories to a history all the

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,990
way back to the beginning

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:13,320
in 1996 we can see that we have both the

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:17,060
entity size for win right card

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,310
consistently in 2010 that it drops right

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:23,250
interestingly that's the same time when

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,780
Paul found the differential equation I'm

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,910
currently trying to work will use the

00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:30,270
pathway like rotten failing so far I'm

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:33,900
not sure what but that was interesting

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:40,410
to find same tipping point date and then

00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:42,150
it's declining and so we can see very

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,490
interesting thing is that when there's a

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,410
point sensitive we we have predominance

00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,690
where the chip size is kind of constant

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,910
there right we have a plateau on the

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,490
team size and during that same barrier

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,640
where can you see the activity coming up

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,460
crazily and if you look back at history

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,990
that basically the time where we can get

00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:05,490
info and so everyone was busy just

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,110
breaking everything in Cavey lives and

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,270
so obviously that was generating a lot

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,740
of complaints and so on we will same

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,740
team right so you can have a great

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:18,780
variation on that we're having a fixed

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:22,520
team's files and which is inconclusive

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:29,160
and the greatest question for us is

00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:31,440
still declining or not tough question

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,020
and that's also I mean when I exploit

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,630
those graphs that's where most of the

00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,280
risk is because look at that right I

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:42,210
mean if you look at it to me

00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:45,290
it's team it's still declining I'd cut

00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,290
it that way all right

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:55,220
that are pretty matter is very because

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:59,830
night we don't have a big drop that we

00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,830
had before right which is queuing of you

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,600
looking at something which is defined

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,790
that much anymore so the thing when you

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,710
get something like this and I because

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:16,960
Lydia was particular actually sampled

00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:20,060
some of the data data points you see

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:24,520
that's more that you would be relevant

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:28,070
we it's not completely stabilized yet

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,230
but very clearly it's almost stabilized

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:33,740
at that point right so it looks like

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,410
yeah we had declined now we almost there

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,360
which in plateau and seeing the amount

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:42,140
of new faces I see this year I mean a

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,890
mechanical things you agree that some

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,890
more from there so that's

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,650
interestingly that graph is when I

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,960
published it on my blog in the one which

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:58,930
but we must comment because I was

00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:01,700
outraged and 2010 deep and so on again

00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,910
but that's not most interesting stuff

00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,960
you can come up with in my opinion when

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,610
I do stuff like that

00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:13,460
no one's comments on it lazy bastards

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:15,440
but the thing is I mean we can do that

00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,080
right so I witnessed it emu blood

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,050
remember I am playing on the faculty

00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:25,020
I mean resolution was very low in the

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:27,089
amount of cross we add that we can

00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,070
easily than before and so we can see

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:33,300
that a lot of motels really is a bad

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:36,720
word because I mean it's like I will

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,899
burn everyone ever every single week

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,850
right of the year it's just crazy but

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,070
then we can spot things like something

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:47,430
happened work around that fat flower

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:50,420
week I mean it it's been lately churning

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:54,149
a couple of comments

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:58,290
thirty is something that's actually the

00:15:54,149 --> 00:16:00,779
Rande effect right that week it was at

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,980
one low and that's one that you churn

00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,980
cottage cheese right

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,810
we have also see things like that right

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,660
we can also lose so that scaly p m--

00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:26,550
again the conservator network from last

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:30,390
year which is Danielle ok I mean

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:34,829
activity worker still at him and then

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:37,350
there's this guy I mean winter well I

00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:41,190
didn't winter if you look at him I mean

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:43,829
most of you haven't seen him right most

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,920
of you never hear about him think he

00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:53,089
left the community is doing stuff

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:57,829
camping right a mystical six or five

00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:57,829
central people and then

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,429
you can find that's like this like

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:07,339
official Monica Monica sorry we is

00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:09,230
basically acting as a bridge right we've

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:13,010
got three persons who are connected to

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,449
you no one else right and so that gives

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,360
you so if you want details about that

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,559
with my blog right but that this kind of

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,390
things which gives you an insight okay

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,020
see each person might be happening there

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:27,589
so let's look at that which wanted me to

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:31,190
do is one which is even arbitrary that

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:33,020
three normalized plots where you get me

00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:38,150
some twenty four one contributor all you

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:41,470
get is some twenty is activity and the

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:44,030
green one is the normalized team size

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,070
because what I normalize it work in

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,169
there so it's or between here one one

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,130
because what I'm interested in is trends

00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:56,990
not the absolute numbers and the reason

00:17:52,130 --> 00:18:00,380
why we are the size is that we cannot

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:03,590
really compare the centrality versus

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,860
activity even some size changes so in

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:09,740
that area right if we consider the team

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,590
size somewhat stable I mean there's no

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,780
reason right somewhat stable then I can

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,620
move at the variations of activity

00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:21,830
compared to sensuality that's fine but

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,600
if I try to compare centrality there

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,850
wasn't relative there does that mean

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,460
anything because the team shrink shrunk

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:31,790
right at that point does that make sense

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,510
and so the graphing Booker is a very

00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:38,030
interesting because to get is saturated

00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,340
at that time we have to be very very

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,809
active I mean that's like crazy level of

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,809
activity from him

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:50,590
huge spike in sobriety here with a very

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,770
small spike of activities that's because

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,550
a team size changed all right so that

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,220
those kind of things

00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:00,430
I can look at more interesting so

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:04,140
question again look his activities clam

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:07,030
being why is centrality is dropping

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,940
right for an area where the team size

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:14,350
kind of constant and that ladies and

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:17,470
gentlemen is a sign of folk in the

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,450
community right we have someone who is

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,400
working on something that no one else is

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,290
working right so he started to walk in

00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,940
his own corner I'm not judging the

00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:28,480
reasons or whatever right I'm just

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:34,450
saying that's a pattern right so the 90

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:38,350
Mobile's that was a quick 200m important

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,830
I'm running out of time so what came

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,410
next

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,700
right when we have a few metrics and so

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,890
on that we've been looking at well

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,300
obviously we can look at more data

00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,830
sources I mean that's one of the

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,900
requests like that yeah look at the

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,630
reviews I love to look at the produce I

00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,910
mean thank you of information there the

00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:58,120
fabricator API is just a bit you get you

00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:00,520
to actually add information so it would

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,350
require me to add a very big chunk of

00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,910
time to be able to get there and I never

00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,010
managed together but I would love to

00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,620
rather so there are small sources we

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,120
would want to look at main same thing

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,540
but that's not that is you write your

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,000
committee sorry that's your view spots

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,620
right what matrix monitor sources and so

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
on but if we do that we are always

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,420
looking at history that's pretty much

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,860
what I do there Mike but when I a story

00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,200
might find patterns like the one I

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,680
showed before and maybe we can start

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,680
reduce tough

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:37,730
can we try to predict when someone is

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:40,070
slowly on weld right okay we try to

00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,830
predict when we're at hands not you

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,810
situation with Christian which then will

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,570
make us or at least the community

00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:51,050
working group or active in figuring out

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,880
that maybe something bad is at the

00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:56,510
inside of this team right because right

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,090
now the committee working group find the

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:01,730
facts when it's kind of too late right

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:04,400
sometimes odd Ash words have been

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,870
uttered already if we could get early

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,660
warnings about that they could be

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:11,450
proactive and before we drag the

00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:15,110
relationship then we can to try to

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,850
salvage it so that's one other thing

00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,790
which would be interesting to do love to

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:22,400
do at some point but again sometimes

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:25,940
right the key thing the other one I have

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,040
is more funny idea is like again Auto

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,500
recommendation system you contribute a

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,290
contributed to K mail the gate for the

00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,970
past four weeks maybe you would be

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:38,780
interested in checking out with H list

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,790
as well right sir

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,350
for the onboarding that would be

00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,170
actually something interesting to do

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:47,870
right because often contributors they

00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,820
get him because YK maybe there's a small

00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:52,070
thing I don't like and we fix it and

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,740
then know what right we were uh turn

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,530
then to a proper retention we might

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,840
easily put them to what other tasks we

00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:02,270
have prepared but maybe at the end of

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,580
the day came in is not easy software

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,110
product you like most and maybe would

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,600
like to look at something else right so

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,160
if we have a way to provide some

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:16,250
interesting recommendations for them

00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:18,170
that that could be interesting alright

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,830
that's pretty much what are you looking

00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:23,930
at for future

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,670
thanks for your attention and you got

00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:30,260
any questions if we sit up trying for

00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:37,700
that because I'm I'm two minutes so you

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:42,020
got questions how we have a break after

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,910
that yeah bring questions oh yeah before

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:48,010
the first question one thing I forgot to

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:50,660
mention there will be on Monday morning

00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:53,690
there will be a buff on Monday morning

00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:56,180
about that topic so if you won't get in

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,820
if you want to give an ant we can come

00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:01,760
to that work if you have ideas of things

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:05,000
to measure then we can see how up that

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,250
would be and visible or not so we can

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,320
have discussions more descriptions below

00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,320
that but questions

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:24,180
[Music]

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,250
could be that the apart I mean I can

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,880
that's why I actually did that one in

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,289
two blog post MIT right because

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,570
obviously I fail because I'm seeing

00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:55,760
human and so on so sometimes I sleep

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,309
something somewhere where I shouldn't

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,500
but I try to a post where I'm actually

00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:02,840
looking at data and trying to figure out

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,120
okay what's going on kind of a cold and

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,640
way of looking at things and then having

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,570
my own opinion interpretation at

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:18,230
distance right and that's what I try to

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:19,340
do then faint like so from the time

00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,140
where it happened

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,870
right so the second blog post is not

00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,970
only about the data right but the data

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,860
tells me that the time where it happened

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,520
and we have a half time to recover from

00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,230
that

00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,880
right so the time where it happened

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:35,480
actually the good switch and we have a

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:37,400
are trying to recover for that so that

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,890
means there's two periods in there right

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:43,990
the switch to get itself and the only

00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:46,909
reason why we would have drop like this

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:50,150
with the switch to get is because it was

00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:52,039
out to use at the time I mean back if

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,770
you remember 2010 when you get what

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,049
there it was will be that news for

00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:00,710
almost everyone right even seasoned

00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:04,520
developers and then the certain period

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:07,730
where it improved it up it'll appear

00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,830
everyone knows yet and still we still

00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,740
have our time to recover and then that

00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:15,020
patch claria which is one way in well

00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,549
obviously we have to speculate me so I

00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,409
have an opinion about that which is not

00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,630
answer to because I have nothing to

00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,610
really back it up apart from my own

00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,480
personal experience when I get to the

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,480
University and

00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:30,159
basically I mean when I put students in

00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:32,409
front of a bike at all they're like oh I

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,859
have to create an account I can identify

00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:38,679
myself with Facebook right I mean

00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:40,509
there's kind of crap I mean I hate that

00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:44,559
that the kind of crap I have to hear

00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:46,809
right and yeah if those people think

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,609
that way obviously you put them in front

00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:51,099
of something so in my case I couldn't

00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:53,320
even be fabricate our really--that's

00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:58,749
identity right they have to create an

00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:01,419
identity for them we do this right I

00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:04,119
don't want to do this I want to identify

00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:06,849
with Gita or with whatever and we don't

00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:08,289
have that option right so maybe staying

00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:10,749
with fabricator I'm just fixing that

00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:12,849
would be enough Vanilla's right then my

00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:14,409
personal opinion is probably more from

00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:16,330
the interactions I got with them because

00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:18,399
I can fold them to create an identity

00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:21,119
and then see how it goes and they do not

00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:21,119
have more problems

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,790
right so that that's why I select if you

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:55,440
also look at other communities because

00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:57,600
at one point I mean the problem I figure

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,850
at some point is that I'm too close from

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,380
the data so in some way that's normal

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,430
right I'm doing this because I want that

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:10,560
community to improve but then if I want

00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:13,680
what patterns and so nice to try to find

00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:17,100
them at other places which forces me to

00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,410
try to do other things and so on so one

00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,810
of the things I think we try to look at

00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:25,800
his next cloud because they've got a

00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:28,980
fork right so the fact that they go to

00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:33,180
talk means it's interesting for me for

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:36,240
that so I would probably pull data from

00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:39,240
next table or the data on cloud try to

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,190
find back the parallel where things were

00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,080
happening trying to put things and see

00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,390
how it goes so that one of the things I

00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,220
have on my mind yeah definitely I need

00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,920
you to get more that's why last one I

00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:53,280
need cute in C rows because I've been

00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:56,000
thinking before Us Weekly two different

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,000
things to look out for

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:37,950
[Music]

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,630
not this I mean I don't you have an

00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,700
addiction about that because yeah

00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:51,850
clearly it's more hip to do stuff on

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:55,570
Android right I mean because they leave

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:57,760
that baby or so and so they want to play

00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,980
with this and and so an option is also

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,590
for us to go more aggressively on this

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,630
kind of platforms I mean if kirigami and

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:08,020
so on so we are having actions to what

00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:12,100
that already and that's the thing to

00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:15,850
push them right so I've no pathologist

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:18,810
shown about that but clearly I mean

00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:22,870
there are other factors as well right

00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:24,700
because if you take a team playing with

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,460
the phone yeah obviously

00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:30,940
I mean it's Android or nobody won't

00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:33,210
contribute to it if you take a student

00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:36,490
which is in software engineering

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,050
yeah then yes we think of platforms

00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,880
could be interesting

00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:42,880
but Munich's is still interesting in

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,950
some universities as well so for those

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,020
ones there are small factors and that's

00:29:44,950 --> 00:30:05,380
more those factors that I'm looking at

00:29:47,020 --> 00:30:06,730
with the story that we have so by you

00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:10,809
mean the impact that could have on the

00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:14,440
community when I produced that yes and

00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:17,470
no in the way I mean in the way that

00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,210
never got beyond the point of maybe that

00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,900
we kick their ass in doing something

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:26,140
about onboarding for instance which is

00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:29,040
great because you're there so that

00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:32,830
that's a good thing and that's what you

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:40,450
if the graph about the team size and

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:41,800
commit was really really bad I can tell

00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,410
you I would have published it or not

00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,820
right the thing is it get to a territory

00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:49,270
now where it's kind of inconclusive

00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,650
that's good right in that way because if

00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,540
that's inconclusive if that gives the

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:56,080
message people that it's in your hands

00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,809
now right at the time when Paul did that

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,150
in 2014 that was still very much inside

00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:03,220
of decline so when people are confronted

00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,929
with that and I think that's why we

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,980
shied away from the debate at the time

00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:11,590
that's oh my God we're gonna die and

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:16,520
that's basically people being cutting

00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:18,980
the lights of a car you mean quickly

00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,450
and so they basically just freeze and

00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,910
don't do anything about it but we're out

00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,650
of that so so the other thing it's

00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,780
inconclusive now it's kind of stabilized

00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:29,750
here you can go in any direction we want

00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,460
right it's not like we have some force

00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:49,640
of nature or forcing us to move shrink

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:51,890
or anything right so one thing the same

00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,480
file on the same time period I'm looking

00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,790
at right so if I'm looking at the time

00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,610
period of a week that if two

00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:02,360
contributors search the same file or set

00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:04,760
of files that week one thing I didn't

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,220
mention that the link as a weight as

00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,140
well so if the overlap in the files I've

00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,210
been to change that week is very large

00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:16,220
than the weight of that particular edge

00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:18,470
is iyer and so then that plays in the

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,490
centrality computation that place in the

00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,490
layouting of the graph

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:35,269
right we have a birth on Monday morning

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,539
10:30 for your opportunity so that's on

00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:37,539
the wiki

00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:56,200
