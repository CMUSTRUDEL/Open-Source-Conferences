so first I want to start was a short

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:16,240
introduction to kiddie community

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,080
sighing technical problems

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,030
so freakos currently those are privacy

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,850
software top-notch usability and

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:56,170
productivity and in light of new

00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:59,490
contributors and that last one is are

00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:02,920
they related to our student programs

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,940
because we carry as a community has

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:10,270
always been very much about mentoring

00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,190
people teaching them how to write good

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:18,940
code how to contribute to a source

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:24,610
project and we have programs what do we

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:27,280
have we have seasonal carry google

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:32,850
Summer of Code and Google codon we've

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,850
also taken part in outreach e v-not so

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:40,560
google Summer of Code it's

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:46,829
I've programmed by Google as the name

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:54,540
says that's run to get university

00:02:46,829 --> 00:03:00,629
students basically we have participated

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:03,439
since 2005 and it's always been a

00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:06,629
meaningful contribution to me because it

00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:09,120
taught us to think about ok but can

00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:13,680
people actually do another project how

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,220
can they do it what kind of things do we

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:28,950
need to improve into documentation

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:33,080
explaining and it was nice enough to for

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:35,310
summer in

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,830
[Music]

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,540
one is probably de commented on making

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,170
period at the beginning where they

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:48,990
really get to know the people who let

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:51,630
him in there there are regular

00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,190
evaluations to really help the students

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:58,500
stay on track with their project and

00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:00,720
adjust that if needed and it is very

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,230
much focused on code and development

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:09,420
work so not market we need documentation

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:11,790
transactions and medicines the next one

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:15,480
every day pardon is will codon which is

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:19,020
a similar program but for younger high

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:26,400
school students mostly also hosted by

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:31,730
Google in the other and it's it's not

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,730
paid points

00:04:41,660 --> 00:05:08,900
and it's a lot it's always because kind

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,900
of

00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,790
[Music]

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:39,220
[Music]

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:53,650
and me German who also gets to go to do

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,650
trap procedure

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:01,180
every up season of kdeeny which is our

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,819
own program every run because we have

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,270
seen that there's a lot of enthusiasm

00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,430
around

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:23,050
Papa Smurf code but there were people

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:24,550
who didn't any number of reasons why

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,740
they couldn't be a part of google Summer

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:31,990
of Code but still one of this structured

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:34,900
program to free software project so we

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:46,060
asked this it's much more relaxed and

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:49,029
less there's also an evaluation and we

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,449
send a t-shirt and some stickers and a

00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,449
nice car

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,130
four hour time span already and a

00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,290
certificate to say that they

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,970
successfully completed their projects

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:08,410
which they can use for example for

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:12,540
university application and it is open to

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,540
more kinds of contributions or not just

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:33,160
alright and it's mostly doing super

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,070
appreciate it and it's a very nice thing

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,530
to see all these people coming to our

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:45,370
community and getting their first taste

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:47,699
of contributing alright

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,699
with that

00:07:51,250 --> 00:08:00,010
maybe I have a question first who has

00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:00,610
taken part in any oh yeah give yourself

00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:11,250
a hand

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:11,250
awesome did you ever do a season of Katy

00:08:41,000 --> 00:09:22,430
I would say that if you ask any TV that

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,070
has participated they know very well how

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:27,470
about it what is it is valuable for the

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:30,560
mentors because there's nothing like

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,880
teaching somebody else to help you

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,470
figure out what you know and what you

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,510
don't know and it also helps you clarify

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,170
things and it probably makes your own

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,170
photos better

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,710
also we're figuring we're always trying

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,110
to figure out how to onboard the

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:54,260
students better how to include them in

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:58,690
the community more the fact that we

00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:03,530
didn't do GCI last year google code-in

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:06,800
we usually call it juicy eye we wanted

00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:10,250
the students for previous years to be

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,410
mentors because they're closer in age to

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,230
the students so the fact that you didn't

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:19,910
do it last year was a loss for us in

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:24,530
that we couldn't recruit those students

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:27,770
to be part of that but now is the time

00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:29,839
if you're in a team that has any sort of

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,300
short tasks that can be done in a day or

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,240
two to start selecting those somewhere

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,640
not just in your head but on wiki or

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,120
some sort of shared document or even

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,850
just an email to your TV mailing list to

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,019
get discussions started because

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,860
now is the time to start collecting

00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,860
those ideas

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,619
well

00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,179
[Music]

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:07,519
[Music]

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:50,050
one of our most successful Google or

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,640
summer of KDE people was not a student

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:56,760
had been a student for many years and

00:12:51,640 --> 00:13:00,550
created the first CI system for KDE so

00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,360
that has been superseded but she got the

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:07,720
ball rolling

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:10,900
and and when she was just overjoyed that

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,840
she could do that not being enrolled as

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,560
student so it is open to anybody who

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:21,120
needs mentoring if we can find a mentor

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,120
for the project we'll do it

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:06,160
if you like administration join us you

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,160
too can send nagging humor emails

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,479
[Music]

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,729
