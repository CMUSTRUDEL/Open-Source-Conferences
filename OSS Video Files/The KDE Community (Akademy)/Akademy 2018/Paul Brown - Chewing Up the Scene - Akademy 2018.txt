Description: 
	Create "vanity" transitions and other interesting things with the Kdenlive video-editing software
Kdenlive

Learn how to create "vanity" transitions and other interesting things you can do with the Kdenlive video-editing software (and others).

Kdenlive offers you a great many of transitions and effects to spice up your videos. However, sticking to what is just in the box, can have the opposite effect, making you movies boring an trite.

In this talk I will show how, by combining different techniques (and even different applications), you can create your own "vanity" transitions with fun animations and other tricks that are not obvious at first glance.

Along the way, we will discover what Kdenlive's limits are, why they exist, and when to use something different.

[Music]

00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:29,920
we underwhelmed but I am moving outside

00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:33,680
my comfort zone and talk about stuff I

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:37,489
make videos I have read videos for

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:54,890
different publication as participants

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:58,280
stuff like that and if you if you are

00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:01,159
bad at something then you know just make

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,100
it part of the bigger don't write a yes

00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,350
trying to better of course but if you

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,890
know a crappy drawing what make carbon

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:14,780
roaring you know don't try and be

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:20,900
something that you wanna do I wanted to

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:23,410
make right what that I actually made I'm

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,410
going to show you that this debate is

00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,410
for

00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:33,740
okay so magazine containing anything

00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:36,140
back in the day there were simple

00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:41,780
effects they wanted to achieve and this

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,789
is one of them okay just so humanism see

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:51,590
these in order to glory

00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:55,009
again any new girls so how do you do

00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:58,250
that at the most the thing is that okay

00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:02,719
I want to do this I have no idea how I'm

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:07,250
gonna do this right and they have no

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:10,519
idea about you know I have no formal

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:13,099
training in ATT and I just played a lot

00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:16,849
with cake in life right and they was not

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:19,280
happy with I think we need use a normal

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,859
transition like a star or something the

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,200
soup's on left to right or whatever is

00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:26,329
not equal you are using a word processor

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,489
and you usually once and it's all the

00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:30,530
different fonts you have that is

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:37,060
something the typical beginning usage

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:37,060
right and yeah okay I'm happy but I

00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:45,860
so the first thing you do when you are

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,360
like me and have no idea how to do it

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:55,010
you can't eat with a sledgehammer right

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:57,710
so the first step for me well okay so

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:02,300
that's why I wanted to achieve was the

00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:05,210
same thing I will draw if we single

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:09,200
frame of animation by hand you know

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:11,000
using gave a critter whatever and move

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,620
it from left to right now in views of

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:20,300
silk here we write a pure green here and

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:39,440
then I will just take a night put it on

00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:42,790
top right and then I will make the

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,790
underlying video

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:56,440
right that was my first for that video

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,440
if I have to do this again

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,250
that's right oh and I have to do it also

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:09,400
with not just static in international

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:20,570
travel to the future with something

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:26,320
so I wrote script and in the demonstrate

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:30,620
to you right now knife works now he sees

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:35,870
them also how many pieces go along but

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:39,620
so I have this video right that I

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:47,900
downloaded from the internet I am pretty

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:51,770
sure so my idea was I'm gonna make that

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,020
guy run across the screen and and in his

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,390
wake

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:59,270
then in his way he will come everyone

00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:02,210
that okay but how do you do that because

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:05,230
this is not just one strain that I move

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:12,620
by hand

00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:17,320
okay so the first thing I had to do was

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,320
get rid of the green screen

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:27,600
so is my true love Oh

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:37,210
the search thing has to do is to reduce

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:43,440
it sit the whole video include new

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:52,000
friends so I have this killing knife

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:57,570
project here because this is not the

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,570
latest one but it doesn't matter because

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:12,580
basically what you do is you just render

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:15,300
the project to PNG right there you don't

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,710
have to you don't have to specify

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,780
anything that you know how many digits

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,780
you want take it I'll do it for you

00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:46,510
okay cynical obese in and what we have

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,350
to do now is to get rid of that green

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:56,400
background

00:06:47,350 --> 00:07:00,280
okay I make it transparent okay for that

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:05,740
several things I'm doing by hand but

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,950
this 195 frames no that's too late for

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,660
that

00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:16,440
so I use it okay so you have to do I

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:19,840
have a little bit Mattox in here just

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,730
wake up like a please you see see that's

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,730
the one okay

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:39,539
okay so basically you have the

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:44,250
background color which itself is not

00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:47,099
exactly pure green right I'm using kick

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:50,430
a color picker or whatever it's called

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:52,919
that moves around the green part and in

00:07:50,430 --> 00:08:03,870
general that was the green okay

00:07:52,919 --> 00:08:06,120
and what you do is oh right well you

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:24,479
know what fast that means that you know

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:28,169
you have 40% near you and then maybe

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:32,089
that okay makes it just era will appear

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:36,829
right so let's try that

00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:36,829
so we're going to try the first image

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,060
every

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:35,150
definitely now the next step is coming

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:38,240
up because this is magic because tree

00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:43,280
just works you just century and in fact

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,530
it works twice if you do it once it will

00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:50,290
sleep they will still difficult you have

00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,290
to that's right

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:15,880
okay now we have to do that with every

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,880
single

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:55,600
yeah that's that what well-produced

00:10:50,530 --> 00:11:00,260
will convert your green screens

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:03,950
animation Simon you can use not until I

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:10,870
get with the next string that happen

00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:20,770
right to make each of the frames for the

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:20,770
transition so I'll show you that

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:40,749
okay now this is the street that I won't

00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:43,179
touch me me to spray news that moves the

00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:48,790
guy from there from the right to the

00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:53,470
left with a mask okay now all this is

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:59,499
basicly you make a big for each frame

00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:02,079
what create a bigger than normal frame

00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:06,999
they do facial Hector

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:09,610
you silly green or black or whatever to

00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:12,399
the right you move it a bit the next

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,709
frame of the animation and fill in the

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:31,139
center center said all that this is what

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:31,139
that does it's done these French

00:12:43,150 --> 00:13:06,050
I'm running around the street because

00:12:48,110 --> 00:13:17,230
like that when it runs we can animation

00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:25,820
frames now it takes what it takes for

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:29,840
parents the first one is the directory

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:35,240
where to find animation then it happy

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:38,529
takes the size of the videos you're

00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:43,970
going to use even transition

00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:49,579
not sight of the animation I have to do

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:58,300
funny see it here so still you don't

00:13:49,579 --> 00:14:00,079
talk about those right foundation no

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,470
okay let this happen

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:07,279
you don't let the right 3d thing yeah

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,819
they make sense okay and every unit up

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,619
there

00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:14,029
so one is seated the mysteriously tears

00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:18,290
of Steel

00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:20,749
okay now thanks to the magic of those

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:43,759
thing I just have to offer this over

00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:54,170
here the size of the video is so we can

00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:57,290
say they can't read that then we say the

00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:00,220
color we want for the drama if you want

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,220
people so great

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,180
of each brand you see what does not

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,330
intersect and then we say coming in

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:12,900
frames we want the animation to us or

00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:24,779
pop the transition of all I'll say about

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:26,360
60 frame that's about right now okay so

00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,380
it's gonna be living here it's pretty

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,360
what it's doing here

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:38,000
now is recycling actuation service

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:44,130
exactly the site of exactly the height

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:55,500
of the two of the two videos we know too

00:15:44,130 --> 00:16:00,570
much together back in also creates it

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:04,610
creates another folder with nation now

00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:18,480
moving from right to left

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:32,750
okay tracking a three-act a mask because

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:32,750
that is the 60 frames and right

00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:43,790
[Applause]

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:54,009
ah so now we have a component we weave

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:54,009
into those right okay

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:16,250
right we've got to load the transition

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:22,970
we don't get to this okay is the trigger

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:25,939
input image sequence and that means he

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:29,140
will not report only what frame will put

00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:29,140
all the frames as

00:17:49,299 --> 00:18:06,700
now what you're gonna see now yeah we

00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,750
need one more just the game or other

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,960
transport and transparent background

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:40,640
running in front of the hospital so what

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:43,960
we need is awesome so we're going to

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,960
know the mask

00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,980
we

00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,130
a little again important

00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:21,139
there now you see

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,480
[Music]

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:12,040
has dozens of options we want to do is

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:19,690
to do a really crude xor as programmers

00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:28,260
denominator R is in this case or not if

00:20:19,690 --> 00:21:11,920
there is a mix of both transparent and

00:20:28,260 --> 00:21:17,530
the bottom layer so whatever you want

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:21,150
just it's just something that

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:26,230
supplements the normal rather boring

00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:30,610
sales positions that we have a I have

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:32,500
more I have dozens of studies I have how

00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:37,920
to make the perfect gift for your back

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,920
be you know I have out me

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,920
[Music]

00:21:53,770 --> 00:22:31,060
I have to finish my program is not good

00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:32,620
enough let's define a tradition that it

00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,460
makes help you need to break leave that

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:39,000
a given example the way healing life may

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,000
be severe

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,720
I don't understand why there are so many

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,270
lives around

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,040
it's a horrible form at their peril to

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:52,300
the lot of people like this weather

00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:56,260
gives it that the TV not me and not very

00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:59,680
good we were that with a city one I have

00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,870
helping to make a much better place and

00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:07,120
keep night in the background you see

00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:10,570
there right but I haven't found a way to

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,990
integrate the system I used to make it

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:16,030
into and actually much simpler than this

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,710
so I don't know that's why I have to

00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:41,570
completely like anything

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:45,020
I have used a new version yes okay for

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:51,110
me crushed all the time so I mean I was

00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:53,059
able to when you dragged a clip and it

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,000
separates for example the outdoor on the

00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:58,399
video which is very useful but the

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,059
moment I'm known to separate me it

00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:05,230
crashed and I admit I haven't come back

00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:21,620
to that in the last two or three weeks I

00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:34,730
think that you saw okay just before I

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:38,720
finish do you realize that the Linux

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:42,289
Foundation has now teamed up with

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,740
fellows yes okay Rita is not on that

00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:45,559
list

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,809
the is on that list we have to get

00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:50,090
critter on that list okay a bit of

00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:54,309
context the little mutation has teamed

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:58,700
up with a loads of big English perfect

00:24:54,309 --> 00:25:02,960
movie companies Industrial Light and

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:05,419
Magic Forbes etc and they are if that in

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,320
a project called the open source movie

00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:11,000
something right and they're what they're

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,630
trying to get is all the modifications

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,700
that those those companies are doing to

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:20,570
open source project they're using

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,850
juicy movies to Sheldon

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,940
right can be compliant with licenses and

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:28,610
stuff like that deep is on that list as

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,440
are many other open source projects

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,780
imagemagick recent Manolis

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,030
if MPEG is on at least his life is not

00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,020
on that list and previously not on that

00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,210
list

00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,640
going back to what is my core function

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,770
here which is probably one of the things

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,110
we're going to be discussing is to see

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:55,600

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:55,600
