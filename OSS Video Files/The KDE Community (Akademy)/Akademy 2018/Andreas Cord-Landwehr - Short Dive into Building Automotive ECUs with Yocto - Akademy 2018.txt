Title: Andreas Cord-Landwehr - Short Dive into Building Automotive ECUs with Yocto - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	Yocto is the most commonly used build and configuration management system for creating automotive-grade embedded systems that are based on Linux. When featuring a UI, these embedded control units often use Qt as their main development platform. But actually, automotive development is also a field where we want to see the use of key assets of our KDE community like the KDE Frameworks 5 libraries, too.
In this talk, I will introduce the basic principles and concepts of Yocto. My focus lies on the integration of libraries and applications into a Yocto based board image and how to generate and to use a cross-building SDK. Moreover, I will discuss the recent steps taken to make Qt and KDE Frameworks 5 available in the Yocto world.

well

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,560
dr. so today a little bit about dr.

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,820
maybe a little bit about the occupation

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:28,130
office historic in the last year we had

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:32,369
to dress up motorsport may I don't know

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:34,860
what about ever but weathers automotive

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,280
together getting going to focus and this

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:42,269
area we are talking lots of times about

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,360
Yocto and how to make York to a little

00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:47,250
easier as KD applications and offense

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,879
many good idea to explain what your case

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,550
it's really hard to get comfortable

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,489
internet what it is how to use it and

00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:01,980
what it's for so a little bit about me

00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:03,750
my little :

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:11,490
I'll see you can find in several

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:14,190
channels ion for some time I did that I

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,209
was mostly active in KDE and learning

00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,700
started it an agriculture company was

00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:23,130
doing big tractors and part of thousand

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,240
for Chavez pass and implements for them

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,590
and mostly of my job to knowledge is

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,069
coming from that time where I'm working

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,599
for it professionally with Yocto and I

00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:38,849
will tell you in a second what you have

00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:41,000
to means so typical things I'm faced in

00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:45,229
my environment

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,470
dr. BAE Systems I'm using a lot huge C++

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:53,280
and going deep into the event violence

00:01:49,470 --> 00:02:03,780
so we need well getting something guard

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:05,580
on the interesting half there and well

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,090
over the clan first talk is took a few

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:13,140
really well short overview about your

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:16,260
tool to understand what other main may

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,500
choose in your to how it can be used and

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,110
to give you starting points if you

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,920
the reason why I'm not trying to do any

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,200
it well

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,710
all the flights giving you examples

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,030
that's typical doctoral training takes

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:36,060
about four to five days it's a really

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:40,710
really a steep learning curve when

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:43,170
you're successful but well you know what

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:50,820
you are doing but it's complete complex

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:56,520
stuff you're facing okay some basic

00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:58,260
notions and simply use and I want to

00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,940
explain what it is so that's an

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,690
arbitrary picture I found on the

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,640
internet and I only took this month

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,030
since there are some well names of

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,190
interface moments so I don't have I

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,840
don't even know that a trend or you'll

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:18,240
be good so we're talking about issues

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,640
that are very controlling

00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,070
so essentially it's a computer you are

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,300
putting in some box and then you are

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,850
putting it into your machine

00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:33,120
or maybe it can also buy the cell phone

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:35,340
it's a specific device that really

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,690
customized for the use case you want to

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,940
use it for for example if you have a

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,110
automotive control unit in a car or a

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,780
tractor or so on

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,720
you want to have certain connectivity's

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,160
like you all want to have can bus access

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,760
so it can also see the main

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,620
communication system on vehicles you

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,480
probably also want to hurt Ethernet

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,410
wherever we are not talking about the

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,880
unbasic

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,480
isn't happy annoying from your laptop

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,570
it's more 181 which is automotive great

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,110
isn't it this which is a little bit on

00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:16,560
the physical layer you want you have

00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:19,080
serial connections since a lot of well

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,030
all you see used on the air serial

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,250
connections and you're facing this

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:26,850
legacy hardware and this is the little

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,990
bit somewhere to connect your memory but

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,319
you buy it

00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:34,169
without some patron I care if it was USB

00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:37,080
card a lot of more things you have on

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:38,849
the customer part there is a really

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,520
important point you're talking about the

00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,990
custom hardware that was off designed

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,190
for the use case where you want to use

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,610
it and so you have happy developing them

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:53,130
up and doing the software development

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:56,419
and the work that takes a lot of time I

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,639
never saw it the less than a year

00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:01,530
hopefully it's less than two years and

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,169
the beginning you have a few prototypes

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:08,370
maybe one two must be where you can use

00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:12,720
later on maybe ten then 50 100 depends

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:15,449
on how good or how finish the idea is at

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,120
a time that also means for your

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:20,280
development but often you have only

00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,889
really few devices that you can use to

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,690
test the software that's a real problem

00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,280
since you are developing software that

00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,860
last one when if you should be on

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,690
embedded device but you can't act on you

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,340
only have one or two to four testing

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:38,520
purposes so they have to be avoided and

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,440
possibly already have here but other

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,639
parts inside year the time device

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,590
changed over time you also might have a

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,740
complication process or that's the often

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:52,949
like you're only doing for the system

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,590
updates vary from some real allowing the

00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:59,430
whole root filesystem and updating it

00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:02,130
are you ever another custom guy so it's

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,919
not like a typical lining system we have

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:08,150
a beta package is one of each other at

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,349
least often it's not recommitting

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,719
usually have different Hardware

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:14,880
you want to you are developing on then

00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:18,080
the hard way go tell you develop with

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,630
forth so is used often is magnetized and

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,669
I think most of us don't have a device

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,979
for the main development so you are

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:29,479
building your creative software on x86

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:32,400
device and building it for annulus

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:35,310
so you're also paste is problem that

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,419
f crostini good shape so one

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,860
architecture for another application and

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,260
whether the stock and only talking about

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:49,740
Linux operating systems and I'm not

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:52,350
talking about real-time the issue I want

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,740
to talk about this talk the true

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:59,280
statement doctor tries to solve the

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01,229
following let's see we have a specific

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,740
issue we want to develop software for

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:07,830
that means we want to have a full system

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,570
image that you can finish after on the

00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,639
English so maybe it's end of the line

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,840
where you are reading production or your

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:19,199
system image they get updated later on

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,030
the system image take vacations its

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,699
libraries that you want to flash and

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:26,850
it's important that's no magic happen so

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,310
that's its media refugees to the did it

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,280
you can start it together together again

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,169
so you get all the same size hopefully

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,110
without getting re trace off from the

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,900
internet and that we also be very fine

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,940
if you maybe get some revenue until

00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,060
years after from the truth it's also

00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:48,450
possible there and we are working on x86

00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,150
machine and this talks about how dr.

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,070
twice this moment that still not really

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,470
get with yeok or well these are

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,139
techniques but I'm getting more to what

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,680
you up to this yoga isn't we need to go

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:04,560
to this combination project they used

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,590
cemeteries I have found this really nice

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,349
Crouch from the actor project the other

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,270
project is episode collaboration project

00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:14,669
that provides templates to use and

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,830
methods to help you create custom lines

00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:19,669
based systems from bedded and IOT

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:25,919
products regardless of the architecture

00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:30,240
so they are casually choose from several

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:32,849
areas and creating an ecosystem where it

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,400
doesn't make it simple so it's just

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:38,339
before we were faced with arbitrary

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,490
basis from cannot render very well

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,070
attacking your

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,870
they start with one specific vendor and

00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,640
hybrid system and you could simply

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:50,350
change to another one and that's also

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:52,540
well me we don't like that

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,149
sorry you have the perfect price for

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,390
making into speaker system or making

00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:00,550
life very simple to provide or to take

00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:07,140
any part during the job for creating

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:07,140
such energy and to reuse what you did a

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:16,750
few basic notions that are extremely hot

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:19,990
G of you are following for a recipe is

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,940
maybe the most reference the most

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:27,370
fundamental in terms of your code it's

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:32,160
like a recipe for cooking your knees you

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,720
know you have a few videos that you need

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,920
and you have steps you don't have to do

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,440
and at the end you get the results so

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,230
these are recipes from in software on

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,680
how to get source code how to modify it

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:52,390
or delete it how to get to resize and

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:55,209
other packages and then and the other

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,600
sense this group of recipes so family

00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:00,370
recipes that are together

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,579
that's a little bit more it's a guru

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,970
it's better so they make already hates

00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:06,220
this

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,339
we have layers on top of each other and

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:13,630
it's one of the biggest points of the

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:15,940
year Yocto system but I have recipes but

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:19,240
that's tech elite rather and they

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:21,630
utterly but a higher priority they are

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,730
can adept Lord where your emails for

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:28,060
example if you have a great recipe for

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,700
cell library so it's not working for

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,230
certain architecture you are working on

00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,470
then you can add a patch to a higher

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:39,640
priority layout so append the recipe and

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:42,490
modify it in a very fun way and getting

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,770
them well yeah

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:49,330
how many your specific Tetris movement

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:52,060
that is a rich I'm talking always about

00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,550
two loops fire system English so great

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:58,990
reliance PC it and doing LS at root

00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,490
that's what I do and that I won 100

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,330
files attack we could put bunch of minor

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:14,920
and very device and talk about the case

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:17,440
of a physics life of embedded software

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,270
or the information are distributed

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,860
between your two and openembedded on the

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:29,290
internet and the reasonable is not China

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:31,990
came from guys who are made made systems

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:34,690
that went on home computers and a lot

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,550
about looked into the cost painting

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,830
process at the tooling and I did a

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,780
really good job and they are really good

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:44,740
results that are simply uses the octave

00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:46,930
project and there are two crucial things

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,540
that either show exist in the next slide

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,160
one is open embedded core and run this

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,440
 bake which is the building

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:59,350
shooting of my bed cause you make me

00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:02,980
turn data you need for a baby so in a

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,320
nutshell what open ed core is it defines

00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,920
the crucial bits for your cross

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,380
combination so it defines is how the

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,390
sensor tasks are performed like how to

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,330
obtain soft board and that's not as

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:18,820
simple as a case as it sounds it's a

00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,100
different different when you are getting

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,490
soft goods from get from again from

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:29,980
child there are several ways how to

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:32,170
obtain source code so let us define how

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,830
to configure small for example assuming

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:38,350
how to set up the bill dependencies how

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,220
to define what is behind what this big

00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,690
fire before it could be a software and

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,420
of course a whole compilation process

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,790
how to trigger Sigma how to forget to

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,390
make how to trigger Auto tools and then

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,430
that's extremely complicated to get

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:57,870
anything

00:12:53,430 --> 00:13:01,200
because working also the hot copulate is

00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:03,780
a smooch which is the target system but

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,980
put onto your x86 system is run

00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,480
subfolder that you can use to

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,080
temporarily start everything you need to

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,890
beat by the target and also traditional

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,780
checks moreover it brings you a lot of

00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:22,770
these recipes I talked about so far the

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:24,180
essential things like you need a PCC for

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,490
example to build something so you need

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:30,720
recipe for that but it's crucial you

00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:33,750
must be let's see otherwise how can the

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,670
bus and a lot of things you often want

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,400
to use and these are also already

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:42,120
provided us of embedded core and I

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,820
provide a service platforms so you can

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,270
go to our lips party see of course x86

00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:51,210
and it was really important to him

00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,580
so here automating emulator is supported

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,200
for which which is an architecture for

00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:04,890
which you can build and test the

00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:08,280
software secondly right very complex

00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:11,250
 system that takes all the

00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:15,420
layers and recipes and creates your

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:18,360
image it does it by well you're defining

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,030
a list of to define which layers you

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,490
want to use it passed all of them and

00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,830
also let's HP higher priority layers and

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,800
pennies recipes from lower priority

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,060
layer it's a set of final recipes that

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,120
you are getting by this layered

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,850
technique and they'll taste also

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,530
possibly tasks and then it looks what

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,290
you want to do it from you have built

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:43,020
requirements for my nice and then

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:46,350
where's some diversification see fancier

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,210
and bitbake goes to three bay and looks

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:51,060
what is required to get the spinach done

00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:54,390
and all these asked event scheduled in

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,770
the bank and run one after each other so

00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,250
for example if you want to build a

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:02,040
archive cosmos did should shoot core

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,900
before and you must first download the

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,270
source code before continuing so they

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,339
are simple tasks

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,640
well well they're complicated to

00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:14,120
schedule in a naive very much it's a lot

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:18,709
of work to do by a big day and it's it

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,850
takes hours real hours I have projects

00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:23,899
let's have from 4 to 7 South

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:28,040
temperatures and not be billed and

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:33,200
that's about 50 gigabytes and for 5

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,459
hours on my age 32 gigabyte machine so

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,990
if you are building everything from

00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:45,800
scratch that's well not nice but really

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:47,770
important here then well now we have the

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,910
baby food we have the core definition

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,860
starts thing that's of course missing is

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,570
a distribution so that how to put

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,120
everything together and there are

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,220
several ways for example this pokey that

00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,870
is something that that is likely applied

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:05,080
by the of the project so reference

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:08,020
distribution how to well yeah power some

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:11,750
systems target system should look like

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:15,560
you can use it as as a blueprint to

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:18,170
create your own institution you can well

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,750
you can also you know just otherwise for

00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,940
example the automotive grade - iostream

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:26,630
can you tell you a lot about it's also

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,310
alternative but these are this Mesa 3

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,820
things like a provide by Optima so it's

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:35,990
a set of set of definitions and very how

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:38,329
to create an image and the power of the

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,420
optic system is like a lot of big

00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:45,050
companies supported and also support the

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:48,860
layers layers I'll use it for something

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:52,640
you get a text layer you get 8p layers

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,980
you get also have the adaptations from

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,589
the big companies you don't have to do

00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,079
it since the ever come set of we have

00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:04,030
become language of defines it the

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:07,160
correction may vary but it's there a

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,280
last point product of the basics SDKs

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,449
are mistreating for pointless

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,949
we spent 20 October that you can

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:18,189
automatically generate a software

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:20,140
development kit with your definition the

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,150
software development development kit

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,430
contains everything to start across

00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,780
building so that's something you can

00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,370
install like if the NDK or SDK if you're

00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:34,000
the Android SDK she off area was any

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,100
with and that you can get an arbitrary

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,440
developer to the developer can use it

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:41,140
and create software cost apply for the

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,810
time device that's useful if you don't

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,360
want to give your to enhance of area

00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:48,430
developer to credits on system it's also

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,060
useful if you want to share with

00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,800
communities also useful in commercial

00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:59,110
contexts when you don't want is close

00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:03,550
all of your source code and what's also

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:06,520
it's that if you have a standardized way

00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:12,280
how to create software development kit

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:14,980
you can use that to set up early at work

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,110
really using ways to configure which it

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,600
creates automatically for you can

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:23,800
arbitrarily your SDK and we set it up

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,420
ice good best we can get the same

00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,260
indicator bed up to also get the same

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,670
experience it'd just be nice and still

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,800
you only have another time a very

00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:40,090
beautiful you wanna put the targets the

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:44,620
software runs which is nice no to system

00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:47,920
the cottage could look like this

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:50,830
so we have a set of layers the boxes

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:54,790
here so they're pokey as a distribution

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:56,430
okay automated contains automatic or for

00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:59,520
the meter information

00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:06,420
delicious our tasks are supposed to be

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:10,940
done it's quite specific and on top of

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:14,220
that you can for example you will

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,140
probably need these people a up so a lot

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,180
of product package layer from the

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,000
hardware vendor often the device you're

00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:26,280
developing for example simply touch the

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:31,440
i/o from Texas Instruments depending on

00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:33,870
the party or working for then you have

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,640
for sure a custom they are they figure

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,050
where you can configure everything

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,400
together but you want to have in your

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:44,220
final system so what Xiaomi Chinese it's

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,020
fine introduces onto your image to the

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,150
libraries and applications and system

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,950
these clicks for assisting these

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:53,940
services for starting up the system and

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,560
so on everything configured as it's good

00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,440
practice to put it with a separate layer

00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,360
and then you can extend with other

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,490
functionality this for example me to

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,640
keep five layer if you want to have cute

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,370
I guess you want and I guess the

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,740
automata let me take a fire provides you

00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:13,590
all the most recent KD frameworks five

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,210
layers and if you want to plus my

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,550
learning on it you can just meet a KDE

00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,830
so there's a set of different layers

00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,140
that you put together and tell your do I

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,790
want to have this beside your pasta

00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,070
recipes 1283

00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,810
there's everything and provide skills

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,940
either system image that you can slash

00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,940
at the end at the take a lot

00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,560
well that's what I already talked about

00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:42,550
for the last night

00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:47,110
well if you work in protest talk this

00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:54,610
afternoon we now have a really decent

00:20:47,110 --> 00:21:01,230
set of meter k5 recipes every week where

00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:04,150
you have updated it so tonight's is for

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:07,330
an integrator or developer for the

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:10,180
target device you only have to say I

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,820
don't know the meter k5p depository I

00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:15,210
have one launch my configuration and I

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,890
add one line since I'm prepared and

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:28,570
everything time to start automatically

00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:30,790
and it's very powerful system I'm not

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:33,990
that familiar with the plasma desktop

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:36,220
but I think first-time homebuyers mostly

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:40,590
completely running the shell but no

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:43,570
attic edges yet some American education

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,300
most pop music a kilogramme applications

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,670
to make it really nice but that's a

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:53,770
really good choice if you want to assure

00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:57,690
that the device is working this payment

00:21:53,770 --> 00:22:01,990
and all the nice things working it's not

00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:05,580
but it's ready - ok which is what both

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:12,940
of the times in the most critical part

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:16,930
so that was a really long talk to and

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:23,890
how to use dr. pepper can be used but I

00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:26,260
mean to start some years ago but also a

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,860
lot of time for me to go filter and see

00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:33,610
whether you are - how do I start and I

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:36,580
try to get give a small starting

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:39,310
procedure might be good idea to start

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,330
this job first of all there's a really

00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,549
good Quick Start guides

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,100
I put a link as a slide and you already

00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:49,009
saw at the beginning they are at a

00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,980
conference back summit that's nice way

00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:57,289
to well download a few sources configure

00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:59,299
bitbake one it wait tomorrow's then you

00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:01,820
every side and you can put you can put

00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:05,690
it into the emulator and see if it works

00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:10,149
in fact your first step to get building

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:13,669
so you know somehow it's working so

00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:15,080
seconds really important step and are is

00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:17,179
the important step in the main

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,639
development development is to bring it

00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:21,789
on to the target audience at that time

00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:25,789
or estranged things would happen

00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:27,909
it's always the same often you will see

00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:30,499
nothing a backspin nor network

00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:34,429
connections are working and if you have

00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:37,789
to connect with USB to serial adapter to

00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:40,609
get your tty zero somehow access and see

00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:42,350
what's the color output messages are the

00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:45,019
beginning to really understand what is

00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,090
going wrong but that is in my opinion

00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:52,220
the second step first get doctor money

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:54,859
in Calcutta and best you some weather

00:23:52,220 --> 00:24:00,529
where they are already working solutions

00:23:54,859 --> 00:24:02,869
like recipe pie for example you can go

00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:09,700
diet eat automotive and use 9x6 there

00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:12,080
are also dropping distributions coming

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,679
and then you can really start playing

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,109
opposite and that's use music meet a

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,950
cute five and create a smaller to

00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:23,779
verification

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:26,239
one in full-screen maybe start with

00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:28,669
already prevalence couple at all and

00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:30,950
putting something on it and it's looking

00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:33,529
cool that's really really quickly in the

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:37,580
first time you see a picture and your

00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:40,190
baby boys and Peter K 5 meter KDE put

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:44,119
everything together and while you have

00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:45,919
to first integrate device the whole

00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:47,360
problem is it's a melee speedrun craft

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,690
and

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,660
there's extreme big amount of

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,070
documentation which is I think good to

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,430
understand if you're really different

00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:01,220
and it's beginning is hard and it really

00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:04,160
takes a long time it's downside problems

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:06,290
wherever it's currently I think one of

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,910
the industry-standard steals and that's

00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,370
really good point and has been also

00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:14,030
schooling for creating embedded devices

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:17,810
and where even the commercial companies

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:19,520
are participating and yes acute

00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,370
companies supporting the reader case

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:26,960
should find we are supporting 2 meter k5

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:32,450
layer and so it's much easier than years

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:36,290
ago to integrated device okay

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:39,800
I also add one page of references I want

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,870
we time that I think one of the most

00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,880
important starting point if you are want

00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,560
to meet something especially is you have

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,840
the project documentation at the website

00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,710
may if you see a lot of need for the

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:55,970
Quick Start Guide for the full reference

00:25:50,710 --> 00:26:00,110
for the big bag reference and one thing

00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:05,150
I just remembered if ever comes this big

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:09,370
bag look for big layers I am Not sure

00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,370
it's in there okay

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,510
[Applause]

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:36,870
from a large with ESP everything is

00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:45,300
build up a batch with Yammer receipts

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:57,030
and buildings into layer FS then I can

00:26:45,300 --> 00:27:00,380
combine the layers to image the tags

00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:03,800
cookies big spicy pudding

00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:06,300
I'm just about image creation I'm not

00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:10,560
well for every package you are creating

00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:13,650
you are reading it you are splitting the

00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,300
package into smaller packages for me

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,960
it's really similar to what Stefan is

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:21,990
doing for stating step and then you are

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,210
populating the switch and I think that

00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:27,660
always taking the reason most recent

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:31,610
versions as long as I didn't change if

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:34,290
you're doing great stuff well you get a

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:37,290
job you know so screw that we have to

00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:41,630
clean but well it's really it's funny

00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:41,630
and expecting spicy food

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,070
so the later it was really a

00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:12,130
congressional hearing system to make it

00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:14,650
easy to make adaptations for Elena's so

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,000
you should never get this situation

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,970
where you change the recipe from a

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,800
layout but you made it making a page so

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,950
you have a very document hoods and

00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:29,740
second layer the 31 to change something

00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:32,740
and if it sounds really hokey or we we

00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:35,920
are at the crucial step

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,920
[Music]

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:13,450
well this is not a question but I just

00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:18,610
want to highlight that the work that we

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:22,480
are doing open apparently a huge door to

00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:25,390
our audience that has never seen they

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:30,010
can't work that we've seen bass in open

00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:33,220
source that industries that are actively

00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,900
looking for creative development so the

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:39,090
developer application developer

00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:40,840
assistance it opened up the door for

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,480
companies that have been traditionally

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:48,600
very close source and they are getting

00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:54,760
to open source companies that have been

00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:56,560
environments aware or cute King so I

00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,110
think we have a lot to offer in many of

00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:02,500
those industries and I also think that

00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:06,220
would be a great area for pity you get

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:09,340
into the spotlight in and bring a lot of

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:12,070
energy for people that do not have and

00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:15,130
that do not know what we have that we

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:17,200
know so I would like to see more most

00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:19,540
people that these guys put in effort on

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,980
that but you see they that and then

00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,330
going to these big corporations and

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,100
getting some money from that that goes

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,100
that back that's how we can story

00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:38,610
yeah always supposed to ask residents of

00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,610
diners but license agreement risk you

00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:54,220
may ask a different question I'm really

00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,080
wondering how you want if this approach

00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,750
it in your face is creating images of

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,840
plaques on the system it's cool how do

00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,590
you want the long term handle the life

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,210
cycle

00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,770
there are many many different devices

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:09,460
out there in the world and these

00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:11,710
machines they run up to 20 years and how

00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,020
do you want a service with all these

00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:16,930
many upstream projects ultimately with

00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:19,810
that especially provide security and

00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:24,700
mascot monkeys are evil devices locked

00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:28,030
down Kevin that's the media but question

00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:30,010
but that's usually but here we're

00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:35,370
providing a structure as that's the

00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:35,370
question for the people were integrated

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:42,750
for the updating process for surely some

00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:45,450
specific system like two partitions of

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,070
the partition system value / optimum

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,260
partition index which the partitions on

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,179
go back if something goes wrong my name

00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,970
is Gordon imagery came right back if

00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:57,269
everything breaks down you don't have to

00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:59,510
send a few technician was the year

00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:03,149
lockdown it's a Camille difference Tommy

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:05,490
as far as I know nobody gets tried in

00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:15,590
the automotive sector to do it really

00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:15,590
this cheap immediately

00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:40,710
I am not sure how eagerly but the best

00:33:28,830 --> 00:34:01,409
advice that I can say let's come here to

00:33:40,710 --> 00:34:03,960
say the definition of the application

00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:07,250
comes with the hardware that's it that's

00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,250
the that's what I've heard

00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:14,250
yeah but I think we all know the story

00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,730
college GPA between and how we get home

00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:20,609
and start this project it was not about

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:23,339
PC was on a pretty yeah yeah but here we

00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:25,440
are talking about well but I just said

00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:27,810
there's open source license its private

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,119
area they don't have commercial license

00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:33,240
company we have commercial license for

00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:37,070
sure and well I don't know anybody who

00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,070
tried to get responses

00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,230
and for showing all the time relation

00:34:40,740 --> 00:35:21,240
Goods and the problems

00:34:42,230 --> 00:35:22,890
yeah that's a reason for educates me and

00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,220
gpsd and that's also the reason by be

00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:29,970
ske supporters at the k23 soft

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:32,270
foundation goat went away to get his

00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,270
