Title: Lays Rodrigues - Atelier: A Printer Host for 3D Printing Powered by KDE and Qt - Akademy 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-05
Playlist: Akademy 2018
Description: 
	Back in 2016, 3 young developers started to work on a project with a goal to make the 3D Printing world a better place.

The 3D Printing world in its core is based on the Open Source world. That movement started back in 2004 with the RepRap (reprap.org) project, when the first patents on 3DPrinting started to expire. With that a lot of hardware and software projects started to pop up. Despite the long Open Source tradition within the 3D printing community, there isn't any good cross-platform solution to govern our printers. In this presentation we will explain how Atelier offers a solution to host many 3D printers easily.

A Free Software solution using Qt and KDE technologies for KDE.

	00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:16,080
and okay a few years ago we started here

00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:22,790
in side KD to fix a problem on 2d

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:25,439
printing but this light passed out when

00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:29,279
when you buy the kama 3d printers on the

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,470
market you have probably you have DC

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,739
screen

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,920
they came but most of them came come on

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,350
whatever with that screen and the button

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,260
on the side that you were to let me use

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,960
to manage the printer that's awful

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,510
to use for example I got to the printers

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,570
that today I measure say stop or is

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:58,079
three subliminals so before the printer

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:59,730
life such fire plug on the and I remove

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,710
the energy and instead of going to the

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,970
menus so things most of the technology

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,720
is open-source

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:13,650
let's get my scripture here because most

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,810
of the technology is open-source and the

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,120
main language that's there printer

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,900
Enterprise is open source that is the

00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,970
g-code file that's this one we can write

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,430
a program to interpret to those comments

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:40,710
and send and push it to the CEO command

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:45,000
to the printer so we just saw novella is

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:47,160
just seven averse and so we is that we

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,260
have it we have this promise but I think

00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,300
that we have this technology the rff

00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,600
sauce seeing start to be open source

00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,210
likely 2004 because of the potential

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,910
start to aspire for the D printing and

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:04,260
we see we use our technology for

00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:06,900
attitude control acts very old so we

00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,090
what we do here developers we try we

00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,620
start to build the software's for that

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:16,530
there are some solutions on the market

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:19,260
but the main the many solution used is

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,950
the Cosette source

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:27,840
that he don't work properly or auklets

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:32,340
farms so we were we had the problem so

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,670
we start to build Italia Italia is

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,829
divided in two parts is attic or that is

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,180
until your car and until here that is

00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:46,109
the interface itself you go we make a

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,870
quick over call at scar is a library

00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:50,730
okay

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:54,269
it handles all the communications that

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,459
3d printer is reading feel guilty that

00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,989
was a decision that we made learned on

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,840
the beginning of development and

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:03,150
development because we wanted to build

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,920
things first and most of the user are

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:09,690
windows so we could build like

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:13,129
cross-platform more fast if it was only

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,870
cute without to the keyd libraries so

00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:19,170
support most of the open-source boomers

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,690
we made that like plugins we have I

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,180
think that six or seven open-source

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,900
femurs available or I have a half a

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:31,440
website and they change a day handle

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,019
that data a little bit different so it

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,160
made plugins for them to handle they're

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:43,980
still tiny difference between them and

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:46,290
is already so for each core is it

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,260
separate or different interfaces so you

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:54,440
can plug anything on it on including KML

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:57,569
because we are at a support depth so and

00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,859
score also has some weed gets libraries

00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:03,959
that we use on a failure because to test

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:07,019
article to validate or work we couldn't

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,329
wait for develop the whole Attilio

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:13,109
interface so we made our release of

00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:16,409
hardcore January we've had a small test

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:21,720
client and we use the same weed gets on

00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:28,320
a failure on with more contact so also

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:31,050
has this Bureau with gas library and

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,729
then we have a terrier that uses guilty

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,779
and KD frameworks we have

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:39,389
some part of the lab is that we are

00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:39,930
using that's I don't know snow is that

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:46,740
much yeah

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:51,990
now is that it is the face of a tear

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:56,370
when you open it we are using K XML

00:04:51,990 --> 00:05:00,379
window we are using K text editor here

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,379
for the editor if I get my mouth yeah

00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,659
now you have a code file here then you

00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:19,199
can edit and do a manage is the file

00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:21,749
save anything that you need we are all

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:28,319
right also using for TD I don't remember

00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:31,949
the rest sorry yeah okay so this is the

00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:35,729
face of a savior we have the welcome

00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:38,370
screen let go that where you have a

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:41,729
quick connection guys we get the news

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:46,020
for website in getting bovid we have the

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:51,719
3d view that needs work that hinders the

00:05:46,020 --> 00:06:01,199
g-code file the editor and a camera like

00:05:51,719 --> 00:06:05,149
getting de o show my face I'm here and I

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:09,449
don't tested but since I'm using QT

00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:11,039
multimedia thing I think we can use UDP

00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:16,789
connection to get to our remote camera

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,789
to use it but I didn't test it let me

00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,590
so as you can see this side is the

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:33,110
general read gates that you can use we

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,180
separated it there works like to

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,230
workspace here here is the generic e

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:41,930
that is common features that is shared

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:47,710
with the application on this side we

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:50,540
have a two-car instance we'd get tabs

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,580
Italia is the first printed host that

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,370
allows you to control more they want to

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,370
do printer at the time so here I can

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,920
open your windows and connect is a

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,720
heaven of serial ports also connect any

00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,550
amount of pieces that I want to and go

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,280
through them in each one in one session

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,550
so this is the first printer host that

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:20,620
allows that because of these their

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:24,590
cooperation this separation from the

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:26,990
article of a failure it is also that we

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,750
want to reach another device like

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:33,110
embedded one so it was better for us to

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:37,910
make this operation the first thing that

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:40,730
you saw is this blog entre see that when

00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:44,720
you open the socket the port maybe have

00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:46,550
some perturb oh so you see the log so

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,920
you can send to us or the beginning

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,900
formation I I don't have a cheesy

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,490
printer here because of mice wasn't able

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,130
to get he said the printer here today

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,170
but tomorrow we will have that so I have

00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,420
my are doing you know with a femur on it

00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:07,820
so I you connect and show you the other

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:10,130
side we have these with the other we

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,430
have Auto detect of the ports your off

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,630
the cookies when I connect the printer I

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,090
sent a comment

00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,000
IG cold coma that returns me are huge

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,800
string where I do I reject to see which

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,270
femur is that so I can't load

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:30,440
automatically the protein so I've change

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,180
the profile here so I can get connect

00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,459
will be fast

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,860
okay now it

00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:44,420
so it's quite fast the profile I have a

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:47,910
profile dialog - to add profiles because

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,040
you can have any amount of printers and

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,230
there you have a lot of materials for

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,199
that so you can have a profile for each

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,660
material and we have this maximum value

00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:00,990
change temperatures that goes direct to

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:04,379
the dial to keep you away from not

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:07,170
burning your house for example yeah

00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:15,480
because the 2d printers can get on fire

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:18,480
so we are try to avoid that and we have

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,480
we have some nice feature is like a post

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,660
post comment when you have as a code

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,240
file and you want first if you want to

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,079
pause the printer to change the filament

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,029
for example you nd your decoder your

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:36,420
code wasn't this license to have that

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:39,540
pause you can add a custom comma a comma

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,660
and then when you hit false articles see

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:46,380
that you have custom comment and we use

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:49,259
that instead of the default one Oscar

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,449
also allows you isn't on a salir yet

00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,220
because it's some work but it's correct

00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:56,430
so they are at supports the code

00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,339
injection also because you don't need to

00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:03,600
get the worker to realize your fiery

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,759
slicing Israel you get este albeit press

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,630
the little program that turns into your

00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:15,779
code so he always had a day in the code

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:18,360
injection but it's a here yeah so you

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:21,089
choose you get the partner right here I

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,189
just connected here and get the port and

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:28,709
get the profile and then your connect

00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:32,040
and that's the like hey let's again okay

00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:35,339
so we have these two main dials that is

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,970
the better than the hots and one here we

00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:43,139
have key shorts with the graph kick-ass

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:46,300
chris view to the movie the axis battles

00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:48,970
of the two general control we

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:54,520
today we have the basically control of

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:56,770
the printer done so you can manage most

00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,850
of the pictures but if your printer has

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,560
a little bit different or femur because

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:06,370
it's open source so you can get to the

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:15,010
femur and add this stuff for you so we

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:17,790
can support that on Italia also I have

00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:21,010
some tab here where you can see the log

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:23,860
yeah we like everything that goes out

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:27,700
and come from the zero connection so we

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,130
have a lot like m100 five that gets the

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,930
Serta / - so we do our rejects on that

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,660
to get the temperatures of the bed and

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:38,010
off the extruder you can push columns

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:41,050
and control other stuff okay I also

00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:45,820
managed a SD card files you can print

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:52,810
for that but at least the lead based

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:55,810
management of the SD card so that that's

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,030
just for now and we have a lot of work

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,520
to do I think that this interface isn't

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,230
good enough because I also think that

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,670
there wants to bring the best experience

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,410
to my user and I think that we still

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:19,200
have a lot of the work to do wanna tell

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:21,640
you to get to a good state because okay

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,090
because I think that kidney has all this

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,580
thing about being given the user a good

00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,800
experience and has the video to conquer

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,230
all the rises I won't be able to do that

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,370
with Italia if I don't give the user a

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:38,940
good experience and ain't what fun so I

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,650
think that knee needs some three

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,350
tweaking before watching I hope that I

00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:47,460
was hoping too long to do doing Academy

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:51,220
but I was able to finish the code and

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:53,560
finish okay I hope that later this year

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,760
we'll be able to we are already on at

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,630
Sakura 2.0 that's almost ready to launch

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:07,660
to

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:10,390
and following probably a terrier okay

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:18,060
let's listen some eyes did this one and

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:21,460
this nice Hey so just showing that I

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:24,780
sent it so the graph will be up here the

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,780
orange line baby

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:34,210
okay so Italia has a cute application

00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,580
run smooth what's wrong

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:41,170
so we have a Kirlian at linux windows

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:43,690
and OS cheese the windows are the

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:47,410
windows user is that i met him like

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:50,860
couple weeks ago and how i want to test

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:53,860
this so the guy downloaded the binary

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,280
and start to use it and gave me a good

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,020
feedback and the praying there the

00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,360
control end to the praetor's at the same

00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,430
time because I attend some events of 3d

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,470
printing industry and the companies

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,300
wants to be able to control more there

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,970
are not more than one preacher at the

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:14,950
same time because they have farms up to

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:16,870
the printers so you may you know it's it

00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:20,650
hurts you to manage each one of them

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:24,250
because a printer host is uses way to

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:27,610
the to easier the life but people that

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,800
has advanced disk use those don't want

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,690
to get by the truck computer so they

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:36,010
want to embed a device or a way to

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:38,140
control remotely so is that kind of the

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,450
work the real focus now giving a check

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,120
or our web layer so we can connect you

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:47,380
remotely and work your knock him over

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:52,780
stone for the interface but these are

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:55,930
things already works and thank you to

00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:58,180
people from TV windows we have the

00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:02,140
binary fire factory run Jenkins that

00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,000
have mastered builds for Windows and

00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,670
os/2 she's

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,190
Linux we have the flat pack that one of

00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:14,800
developers made and I have

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,500
and I to the buttes front down we are

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,030
working on the EPI manuscript but we are

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:24,220
using through Travis CI to build it so

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:26,920
we have it's good that we already know

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,990
that it's being used so they use Windows

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,350
use the download that's back there and

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:37,180
start to test for us

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:41,200
and last 31 July till here made two

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:44,290
years so we had article released

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,080
beginning of the easier that is to today

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:50,050
we have more than a hundred dollars v up

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,970
there for helos for for for IP mage and

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,850
the six for overseas

00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,610
these are running outside here in other

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,110
platforms de Linux was I worried since

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,360
the beginning of the project because

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,570
most of people onto the printing using

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:09,070
Windows I can first then to move to

00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:10,630
Linux I could but I can't so that's

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,200
where the main concern since the

00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,200
beginning

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,620
so when craft here is that the Windows

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,690
and OS she's Yoda is made with cracked

00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,720
so since the beginning we gotta order to

00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:26,140
make crafts to work music failure and at

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,050
score correctly so we could use as car

00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,620
has a Natalia has these numbers of

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:35,830
comments I'm so nervous to say Dan and

00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm glad that these I'm proud of these

00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:43,440
two years and I can't forget to thank

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:46,270
the people that is working with me that

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,760
that will be Patrick Pereira from Brazil

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:51,550
he's our contributor for KDE

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:55,150
most of the developing lady and Chris is

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:58,120
Otello that is for New York and some ice

00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:05,880
for guiding us not killing each other

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:11,010
during the development of Italy okay

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,010
any questions here

00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:22,699
they talk thank you I have a 3d printer

00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,740
home how do I know if it's supported or

00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:30,289
are all 3d printers supported or is

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:32,059
there a list or no okay yeah most of the

00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:43,210
three painters have different

00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:46,010
open-source we have we have you here

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:48,679
also the text we have the plugins here

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,710
so we supports your corpus printers move

00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,690
for a repeater mulling gob oh oh yeah a

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,390
printer this is the femur that we

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,679
support there are open source

00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:00,890
there to the printers that are closed

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,159
source on the femoral they and they use

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,809
Jayco to oh they use another fork of the

00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,049
code so we don't support them because

00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:11,960
they're private Terry and I don't have

00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:14,059
access to them but most of the printers

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,520
that you buy for China anyway are

00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:23,270
open-source you do you know the model of

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:26,029
your printer yeah it works yeah I think

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:31,149
that Annette is mulling Annette I think

00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:34,820
is mulling so probably work and it's

00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:38,720
yeah it's for China we work the only the

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:41,059
proprietary ones that won't work only if

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:47,360
they give him us money to build it the

00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:50,779
support I wanted to ask about the video

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,490
feature I don't have a 3d printer so is

00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:54,520
that just supposed to watch the 3d

00:18:52,490 --> 00:19:01,850
printer as it prints and yeah

00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:03,649
yeah because the more they most wanted a

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,929
feature for anyone that has it to the

00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:08,330
printer is to not depend on the machine

00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:11,720
to use they want I embedded the version

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,850
that two runs on a husband Barry PI to

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,919
connect to the printer so when you live

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,230
the the printer alone printing you can

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,690
connect to that server and get the feed

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:24,760
of the printer to see if the model is

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:29,610
printing right so we have this feature

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:33,130
so this is for money printer on alone

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:37,330
but it is that because don't monitor the

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:40,120
printer and see because there is one

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:43,030
printer hose that is open source that's

00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,390
colored octo print that is is for

00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,919
embedded device you put the server

00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,320
octoprint ona husband berry pie and you

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,090
open your connection it's a natural for

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,780
outside your house so you can connect to

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:58,270
it and get that so we need also to also

00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,549
have this kind of feature because people

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,400
will want to use that embedded the

00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:05,049
industry the industry wants to get

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,530
embedded device they don't care much

00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:10,720
about addicts desktop version so but I

00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:14,380
want to hit them as that depends on

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:24,340
computer and these getting into 3d

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:28,990
printing yeah but i I've been tested but

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:31,240
I think that you can add a little you

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,860
depend you are Harry here for remote

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:40,720
camera and you works because of kiltie

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:42,970
stuff yeah you were already to be a

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,790
connection you can access the remote

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,740
camera but this is only for monitoring

00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:59,440
with Vitaly on your desktop because we

00:20:47,740 --> 00:21:02,710
don't have the web layer yet yeah what

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:07,570
are you using for the 3d view is like 3d

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:11,260
yeah but the the wish are when a Patrick

00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:13,990
did this one was on like alpha or better

00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,200
version of QED so we needed to rewrite

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:20,110
this and as I already invoke you today

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,710
hey that'd be cute 3d man to go to the

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:25,750
or both of these week to build it and

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:29,020
one little curious thing about Italia is

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:32,830
that when you are running Italia and

00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:35,049
printing the consumer memory is around

00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,940
are 100 megabytes of memory

00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:40,460
my main concurrent the

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:44,629
is the one who disclosed that sauce is

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:49,039
like 2 G 2 gigabytes of memory yes a

00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:51,379
shot so we have these advantages you

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,509
have being super supplies and QT that

00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:59,059
make it a life so much easier

00:21:53,509 --> 00:22:01,539
doing the development anyone no more

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,539
questions

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:11,720
there's one guy over there let's take

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,690
this question here yeah I have a

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,779
question regarding the preview so the

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:22,460
the itself is cute widgets based right

00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:25,429
yeah okay how did you implement preview

00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:29,090
before PL or did you use cute 3d you're

00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:34,009
pretty okay yes the source record is on

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:40,460
Kady egg eat okay you can get layer you

00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:43,159
can also get on top my channels we will

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,870
hold up both these Wednesday if anyone

00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,990
watch come please come

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:50,299
we need more developers and we will

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:57,110
discuss this stuff from eyes you'll be

00:22:50,299 --> 00:23:01,669
with us and these are our channels you

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:05,539
can get those there all the time and she

00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:11,539
has one last question and we have a last

00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:16,100
question thank you

00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:18,830
I have a very functional question where

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:21,980
you are in the fear fear of the if the

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:27,700
features of your of utter year compared

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:31,820
to the that commercial software yeah

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:34,330
when I actually started because of their

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,769
proprietary software yeah

00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,679
then I'm another software is aperture

00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:42,080
host they were open source until like

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,929
three years ago under a partial license

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,970
and then they closed the source but the

00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:51,650
program is still awful but aperture is

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,390
good because it's there was the

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:57,650
I think that was the first one and

00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:59,720
everyone say that she used it so I'm not

00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:02,120
making so much fuss about it earlier yet

00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,100
I have contacts with you people wants

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,530
with the printing industry when I really

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,900
need a tell your day you evaluate and

00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,400
indicate to people and I think that we

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,120
can do a better job because I think

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:17,150
repetier is really awful

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,870
you know I repeat here yeah on Linux

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:24,410
runs over mono and they have our budget

00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:26,510
CC version for us that's completed their

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,610
friends interface so I think that I can

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,370
get points so you have a common

00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:35,600
interface or awkward form and get into

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:37,040
the English but at the mass I think that

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,750
people that are interested the printing

00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,820
can use it earlier but people that are

00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,040
already our defenses queue they don't

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:46,340
like to use a printer host they put the

00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:51,470
code on the SD card and it's print but

00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:54,050
they the folks that I have with people

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,910
on industry people factors that make it

00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:59,660
through the pizzas in Brazil for example

00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:03,920
they like it a year because it's open

00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:05,929
source and watch to us to be they want

00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,200
to embedded Italy on their printers just

00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:11,450
because open-source is one of the atom

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,660
and there you don't want to pay like 20

00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:18,770
euros for life for license for machine

00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:21,740
Vic and in a repeater server opens a

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:25,190
browser inside the hospital PI and the

00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:28,460
day to cheese stuff is awful and we have

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:31,640
EML that can give us our huge expert

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,890
good experience or torture device and I

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,870
hope that on the industry that we work

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:40,400
at least if I get this connected

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:46,340
embedded on the main manufacturing

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:48,760
Brazil that we are discussing this is

00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:52,280
our channels of Calcutta Thursday I

00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,990
