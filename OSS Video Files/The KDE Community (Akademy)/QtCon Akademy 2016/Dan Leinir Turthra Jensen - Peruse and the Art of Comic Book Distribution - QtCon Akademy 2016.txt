i've become a cyborg so i've got an

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,400
antenna on my back to see if that works

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:16,320
um right so

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,960
first of all a few introductions to hey

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,960
guys guys nobody can hear

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,640
thank you sorry

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,800
um yeah a few introductions first

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,680
first of all it's me i've been with kde

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,680
for some time

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,600
and got my master's degree in

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,600
writing some kde software which was

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,719
lovely

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,760
and most recently i've been a member

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,879
of the caligra team and before then a

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,079
member of the gluon team

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,680
which is not

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,920
very active anymore and

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,039
most recently i became an employee of

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,559
blue systems

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,880
where i uh last year presented

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,720
an android runtime that some of you may

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,400
remember

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,479
and most recently have been

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,479
working on this

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,439
which is a kirigami based application

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,040
that is designed specifically to do

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:31,280
nothing but read digital comic books

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,119
um digital comic books uh not unlike

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,280
ebooks have some fairly specific

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,280
requirements um

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,119
for how to read them which means that it

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,040
doesn't really work very well in

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,840
something like say ocular which is a

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,759
generic

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,320
very powerful document viewer

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,799
there are some interaction methods that

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,159
simply don't work very well

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,960
and which which something like peruse

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,439
can

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,880
can do because it doesn't try to do

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,759
everything

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,560
it can do that a little bit better it

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,879
reads

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,640
amongst other things the comic book

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,280
archive format

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,480
and one of the problems that we

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,520
currently have

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,920
is well

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
people need to get these things which

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
right now

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,959
means going on to some very dodgy

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,120
websites

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,760
or use nets or you know various sort of

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,760
things like that it's sort of

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,760
not very pleasant that whole

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,160
um there are

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,599
locked down stores out there right now

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,879
which are things like

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,560
comixology which is very very

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,519
proprietary and

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,680
not only do they not have a there are

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,080
problems in that one which

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
are things like their their monetization

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,000
format is a little bit

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
heavy if you're a uh an independent

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
publisher

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,200
um so it's rather heavy-handed i've

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,640
heard

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,920
the horror stories of 70 of revenue

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,239
going to

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,760
the distributor on something like

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,519
comixology

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,120
um and obviously

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879
that that's a problem in itself but it's

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,480
also a problem that

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,080
there's simply no access to that sort of

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,680
thing from outside

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,400
uh so we have to work out

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
a way of doing that so we have this

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,200
thing

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,959
called the open collaboration services

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,519
if you've been here for about half an

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,280
hour you'll know exactly what that is

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,440
um well you'll also know it

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,360
if you've been a kde user over the last

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,519
15 years you will have seen these

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,360
various little bits

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,280
wrong one um

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,280
well that's the k stars which will

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,000
download all sorts of interesting things

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,959
new star caster star field catalogs and

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,760
so on

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,799
but you'll also get all of those little

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,840
star buttons

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,280
all over the place and you already know

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,080
them you've already used it

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,040
and when it comes to the technical side

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,159
of this

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,920
everybody loves to hate this thing there

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,359
have been several attempts at replacing

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,359
it with something else

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,560
and they've all failed

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,520
and these days obviously

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,120
sebas already spoke about this the main

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,479
implementation of that is

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,080
now yeah it is officially now

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,479
a kde project and this is really cool

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280
it means that we no longer have those

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,360
apart from

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,759
the minor technical issue that some

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,120
people just don't like the particular

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,440
exchange format that exists for ocs

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,240
which is yes there are technical

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,040
problems

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,800
but it's a web api there are going to be

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,639
technical problems there let's move on

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,800
from that for a bit

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,560
um so we have some technologies

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,199
in kde that have been working rather

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,360
well for this for some time

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:15,280
the first one is the very low level

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,320
bound directly and rather tightly to ocs

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,199
cube based c plus plus library called

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,199
lib attica

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,759
it's as it says the official c plus plus

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,240
testbed

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,919
for ocs features if a feature is

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,680
implemented in ocs the

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:38,160
the standard that is ocs it has to be

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,280
employed both on a server implementation

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,400
and a client implementation and since

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,039
inception

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
attica has been the one that did that on

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,280
the client

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,280
it is however a little bit heavy

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,199
if you want to do very sort of

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,360
very intricate things it's very powerful

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,759
but if you want to do

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
well essentially things like putting

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,880
those buttons

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,000
uh on a dialogue to get hot new stuff

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,360
it's really awkward to work with

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,240
because the boilerplate is the same size

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,479
for

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,759
for any small amount of work you want to

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,840
do so

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:26,160
hence okay new stuff which is

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:30,880
um which sits currently in tier three

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,080
um it's a currently queue widget based

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,759
and um yeah it's it's very very simple

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,039
very straightforward to use

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,160
um you add

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,199
a new stuff button

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,199
uh to it yeah the

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,240
that one the button you can access the

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,560
other things as well

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,479
but really the button is the one that

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,680
most people use

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,639
um and you just add that to a dialog and

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,639
off you go

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,960
you you obviously you have to have

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,800
content on the server to be able to

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,479
you know use that button for anything

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,440
other than showing an empty dialogue

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,039
that says there's no

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,520
such categories but um yeah it's

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,800
a button and a config file of that's

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,039
four lines long and

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,639
then you've pretty much got it it's very

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,240
very straightforward to use

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,759
um what it is though is obviously

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,840
yeah it's one of the

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,199
heaviest things to include in any

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,960
application

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:34,479
um mostly because uh yeah

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,960
so it includes uh keo which in itself is

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,039
not

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,479
too bad but it also includes yeah the

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,680
text bridges and widget add-ons

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,639
not too bad either but xml gui pulls in

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,680
everything

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,720
literally everything there is no tier 2

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,319
library that isn't

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,680
included um which is great

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,440
for kd applications um

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,280
because you know we've we've sort of

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,879
been used to this for some time you know

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,039
a kd application

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,520
uh generally speaking will run on a

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,360
plasma desktop and that already pulls in

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,440
most of the dependencies and that's all

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,280
fine

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,680
but not so great for other people

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,759
say we want someone who writes a pure

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,479
cute application

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,520
or a mobile application or whatever uh

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,879
to

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,960
to to use the new stock functionality

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,319
it's really heavy it it's very very

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,199
heavy

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,960
and we also have people who may not may

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,000
want to be in places that are not

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:38,240
necessarily a plasma desktop on

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,360
linux and

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,320
some of these places are

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,000
also places that are not necessarily

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,360
widgets

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,880
so what we're working on now

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:56,240
is the splitting

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,920
up of this which

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,880
we will eventually we will have three

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,080
frameworks and i know that there are

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,120
going to be people

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,040
who run packaging and distributions who

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,279
will be shouting at me for this

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,200
uh they all hate when we split up uh uh

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,480
uh split up our frameworks into micro

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,880
frameworks and uh

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,000
i believe there was a an atomic int

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,480
somewhere

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,480
uh framework was that no no

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,959
yes um right so but

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
i believe that this is one that actually

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,959
needs to be split up because

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,480
what it allows us to do is take all of

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,519
the strict

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
widget-based uh functionality that we've

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,200
got

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,920
in k new stuff now and split that out

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,920
into its own thing

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,040
because it is already a released

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,399
framework we have to retain binary

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,680
compatibility

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,240
um luckily

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,519
the knew stuff framework is so

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,680
pleasantly designed

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,640
that that has been really easy so

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,120
as it sits in the branch right now uh it

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,120
uh

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,240
it installs on a system and it doesn't

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,680
break anything at all

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,800
it just works um

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,720
and that's with what comes next um

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,920
yeah obviously some beautification and

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,040
so on uh but all the api

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:30,000
in any real way stays the same

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,399
then we have split out the core

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,399
as it says we can't actually put it into

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,399
tier one because there are some

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,040
still some frameworks that we depend on

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,240
but it's a very low dependency tier two

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,519
framework

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,320
um and then the

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,279
new new framework which is k new stuff

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,399
quick

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:54,160
uh which is a

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,720
sister to uh k new stuff which

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,720
possibly would have been renamed if we

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,200
didn't want to retain both binary and

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,760
source compatibility

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,640
which is obviously so we have k new

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,640
stuff core

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,680
and we have the widget one which you can

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,399
use stuff

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,200
and k new stuff quick for anything based

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,200
on cute quick

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,399
so in k-news of core we have

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,320
a load of stuff that already existed as

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,200
convenience functionality that was used

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,440
in

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,480
k-new stuff that was great

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,720
um yes a bunch of models

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,680
and the engine and the cache which is

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,440
possibly

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,600
uh one of the more important things

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,079
right now there is no way of of

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,000
loading any of this offline you have to

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,120
have an online connectivity to be able

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
to see anything that you've got

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,880
installed

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,920
to be able which is a problem if you

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,760
want to

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,279
just uninstall something that you've

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,959
installed you have to be online to be

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,839
able to check

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,639
the current status of that one on server

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,680
and then we have

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,880
yeah the new stuff quick which is

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:09,440
just a straightforward cute quick api

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,519
in in the way that quick apis must work

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
there are two ways of using this either

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,160
you use

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,560
the uh currently uh kirigami probably

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,800
will just remain kirigami based

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,880
list components which are

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,480
essentially the cute quick equivalent to

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,880
using kns button

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,680
the simplest possible thing you can do

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,160
um

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,120
and you end up with something which will

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,440
list things that are available

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,320
on on the store in the categories that

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,000
you want

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,160
uh in this case uh it is uh also plasma

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,600
tube yamahan web and so on those are

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,680
plasma widgets

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:53,120
um and it just will let you install

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,480
and rate and so on the various bits

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,040
um that exist in that and it all looks

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,360
the same

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,959
so very equivalent to kenya's three

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,120
button

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:08,560
or you can use the api directly

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,880
which is where the more sort of

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,760
interesting opportunities start to

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
happen so

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,920
what you've got here is well the first

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,760
one was

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,279
you just this is where you would get

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,800
comic books

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,839
but obviously if you already downloaded

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,200
a comic book from a series of comic

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,399
books

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,920
what happens when you reach the end of

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,839
that comic book you want to be able to

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,920
keep reading that

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,120
just you know and who knows there might

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,480
be another

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,320
another uh chapter in that series that's

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,279
been published since you downloaded the

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,240
most recent one

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,959
and that would then be able to show up

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,160
in

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,320
your list of what to read next that's

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,279
not something that would fit very well

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,959
into a sort of standard api you know

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,600
obviously this is comic books this is

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,199
very

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,040
app specific so we need to be able to

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,399
access the model directly we need to be

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
able to check what's installed what's

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,880
not installed

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
without being tied to using a specific

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,959
set of

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,160
user interface components um

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,760
and that's then is what the

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,839
this splitting up fix is for

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,399
um so we have some samples

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,560
now first of all a quick little rundown

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,880
of what we've got we've got attica

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,560
which is very powerful we got k new

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,120
stuff core which is

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,079
uh which does most of the stuff that

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,279
anika does except

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:42,000
much more easily much more simply

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,519
um and covers most of the sort of core

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,560
use cases that

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,880
that ocs sort of suggests

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,839
and then we have the old style k new

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,040
stuff and the

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,680
new cube quick stuff now

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,079
attica and k new stuff those already

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,079
have

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,880
very good documentation as it exists so

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,720
i'm not going to talk about them so

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,959
because those samples exist already um

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,399
but k new stuff core and k new stuff

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,320
quick have some

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,480
bits so what you can do with knew stuff

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,279
core that you can't do currently

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,279
uh with

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,480
the knew stuff exposed api is something

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,480
like this

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,639
which is yeah it looks a little bit

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,160
silly

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:33,199
so you always have to create an engine

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,759
which you initialize with your k and src

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,600
which is a file that describes what

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,279
which provider you have your content on

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,040
in most cases that would be the open

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,320
desktop default one

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:51,519
um but it also defines what your

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,519
um uh

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,519
what yeah what the categories you wanna

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,800
want to access are

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,839
what that then does is that

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,680
in combination with getting the cash for

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,079
the application peruse yeah this is

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,079
actually

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,120
a little bit silly so peruse currently

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,040
will look for wallpapers

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,040
uh because we don't have a category as

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,959
yet on the on the store which

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,880
uh provides comic books but

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:26,880
the cash for peruse is told

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
through this bit

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,120
that the right so the engine has a

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,680
number of providers

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,839
which are just string ids which are the

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,040
same as identified in the cache so we go

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,160
through all the providers

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,199
then we ask the ket that the cache

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,560
that we got up here for

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,600
the registry as it exists for

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,079
those uh for that provider and then we

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,639
list all of those entries

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,839
for the provider now those of you who

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,000
have worked

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,040
with k new stuff before we'll notice

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,240
that

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,520
that doesn't exist um

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,799
that's changing so that that currently

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,880
literally was not

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,839
a possibility that's now becoming a

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,959
possibility

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,199
uh so that's sort of the offlininess of

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,000
k

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,520
new stuff wasn't really a thing that was

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,199
considered important before so that's

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,559
now being fixed

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,240
um and so

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,280
the quick stuff so to show how simple

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,679
that is

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,679
this is way more verbose than it needs

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,080
to be

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,880
those message bits don't really need to

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,960
be handled

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:42,160
all you need is that line that line

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,919
and that line and the config file

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,520
um and then you end up with something

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,400
that looks like that and we'll install

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,960
and remove and rate and everything so

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,559
very much like kns3 button very very

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,320
simple very straightforward

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,760
if you're using a quick application and

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,400
just need to be able to install some

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,440
stuff

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,640
that's all cool now

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,039
you can also use this this stuff

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,559
directly so because it's cute quick

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,160
you've got access to the models you

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,760
don't have to

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,880
uh use all of these components so

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:19,039
you know if we take a hypothetical

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,600
uh your own component which will take

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,080
uh a bit of text it will knows what what

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,039
sort of

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,919
things to do with an image url uh we

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,640
know that uh

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,440
the the preview is small bits of the

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,840
model

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,880
is a list of pictures which may or may

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,480
not have any entries

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,600
so because lists

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,440
in quick might crash if you try and

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,039
access something that doesn't exist we

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,080
have to make sure that we don't

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,039
try and pull an entry out of this that's

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,840
that doesn't have any entries so hence

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,320
the sort of

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,840
hard sort of awkward looking stuff there

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,840
possibly something we can fix

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,080
um and then

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,120
we want to be able to put some kind of

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,679
little

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,559
like badge on the thing that you've got

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,919
so

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,960
you get the status which is a

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:14,400
a an enum on the new stuff

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,720
items model which you can check

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,520
internally in your code so just because

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,520
that's easier

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,679
if we say that you've clicked it it can

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,880
then

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,720
check it like that basically the idea

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,640
would be that you wouldn't necessarily

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,400
want to do that you would do that inside

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,400
your component so you haven't got that

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,880
handling there but

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,840
for the purpose of a demonstration that

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,799
i thought that was probably a bit more

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,720
straightforward and all you then do

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:46,480
is you create your engine

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:49,679
you create your model and then you

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,280
use that model's content again

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,760
deliberately very simple very

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,039
straightforward

00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:01,120
um and

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:04,640
so what we then have

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,440
is the ability to read comics we have to

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,760
rules

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,480
we have the ability to get hot new stuff

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,559
yeah

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,840
you put the name in the thing um

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,799
and now what we want to be able to do is

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,320
to be able to get

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:24,159
comics that is the

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,200
new quick get hot new stuff stuff

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:30,720
but we also have some comics that

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,000
we want to have comics to be able

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,360
to get some the problem is

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,799
obviously in any store you need

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,799
content so

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:50,080
yeah some of you may remember

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,840
this picture from many years ago when i

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,400
stood on the stage in tampa and talked

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,120
about

00:20:52,400 --> 00:21:00,960
uh content distribution um

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,960
with gluon and yeah hence also the

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,960
migo logo on that one

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,240
and essentially the concept here is the

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,600
same

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,799
it's someone has an idea we create

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,440
that content we help that person

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,440
bring that idea to fruition we put it on

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,559
a web service

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,600
opendesktop.org and then we can consume

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,440
it and

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,520
we can go back again as well with

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,640
reviews and comments and so on

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:34,720
and but the author can then

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,720
comment back again and everything so

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:43,120
to be able to complete that circle

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,679
that's what k u stop next is

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,320
so if anybody of you wants to help with

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,080
it we have a project on fabricator that

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,360
was created to

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,799
further that um and um

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,720
thank you to ken vermette for

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,360
pulling out all the stops in an hour

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,799
he's created any racket for me

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,280
um and

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,039
we have this little tiny tiny tool so

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,360
far called peruse creator which

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:15,919
will facilitate

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,679
the content creators of the world with

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,280
the ability

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:24,880
uh to create comics

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,000
and now the comic book format is really

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,960
really simple it

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,720
is very literally a zip file with some

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,919
pictures in it

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,280
the problem with very simple formats is

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,960
this whole ad hoc ness of them so

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,919
you can do them but you want to be able

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,400
to do them properly

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,440
so as something like peruse creator

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,679
which will

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,720
make sure that the files are named in a

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,400
proper way and

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,240
you end up with something which is

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,440
actually consumable in a sensible

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,240
fashion

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,480
and then comes all of the extensions

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,440
with the fancy animation type stuff that

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,080
people want in

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,120
digital comics these days that comes

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,960
later

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,200
but for now peruse creator very very

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,360
simple we'll create some comics

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,000
for you to upload to the

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,000
kde store

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:23,840
so yeah that's where we got to

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,159
uh we have three kids for questions uh

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,520
so quick questions i think that's what i

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,120
originally said i wanted three minutes

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,360
for questions

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,120
apparently um yeah apparently that's

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,120
like tight yeah that works

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,480
uh congratulations for your your work

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,880
with can you stuff

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,960
thank you very much uh but uh when will

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:50,960
you hell is it perused to androids

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:54,320
when when you will release to android

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,000
uh as soon as we are able to get uh

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,720
ocular working on android the pdf

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,840
support yeah

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,200
he's hiding behind a pillow now um no

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,679
right so the problem we've got right now

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,120
is that ocular um

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,360
the is the way we get yeah so

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,279
the peruse will sort of read all the

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,000
comic book formats and all of that but

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,480
it will also read pdfs and epub and so

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,480
on and the way it does that right now

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,240
is by using ocular because we have this

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,760
thing that will vary

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,000
that will render all this stuff very

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,679
well but it's kind of heavy

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,679
uh so if we don't want it

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,760
if we don't want pdf support any pub if

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,799
we just want cbr for uh

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,240
support it wouldn't be an enormous

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:43,200
amount of effort

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,200
um but it would be nice what

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,600
well it's called yes okay why

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,039
cbr and not cb said

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,880
cbr is two things cbr is comic book

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,400
archive which is the format

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,679
it is also the sub of

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,720
comic book archive format which uses ra

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,080
to do the compression work um

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,279
so if you see a cbr it is probably

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,799
a rar file but a

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:21,200
said file is also a cbr file

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:24,799
it's just using zip instead so yeah

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,799
the ad hoc formats are fun

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,840
but yes so that that's yeah it'll it'll

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,360
take a while before we get pdf support

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,480
at least on android but

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,919
yeah peruse itself will will happen

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,799
also because i have an android tablet

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,360
and i want to be able to read my

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,360
comments on it

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,840
