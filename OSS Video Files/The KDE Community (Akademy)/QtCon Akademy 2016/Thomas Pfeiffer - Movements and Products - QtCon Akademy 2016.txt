okay so me and Thomas is going to talk

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,099
about the difference between the

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,870
movement perspective and the product

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,060
perspective when it comes to organizing

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:21,960
work more or less we had a conversation

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:24,150
via IRC I think and then telegram and we

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,980
argue a lot and this is one of the

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,840
things where we sort of don't agree we

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,269
sort of have this different opinion on

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,130
how things should work and he has a

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,890
product approach I have a movement

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,129
approach and we're sort of going to

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,770
introduce both of them really quickly I

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,390
come from the left wing which most

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,289
people know which it's not a secret

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,780
might be and from that I got the

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,190
movement perspective it is sort of the

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,680
way the modern left or the

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,300
extra-parliamentary left tend to

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,309
organize things the difference for

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,280
example when it comes to Linux if we

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:05,760
look at at open source there are two

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,580
examples of product versus community and

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,990
movement and the movement perspective is

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,259
used very much by the FSF II for example

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:17,220
but the background for me came

00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:21,180
specifically from two Swedish

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:25,170
organizations Planck epoch new and the

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:29,040
Pirate Bay the pirate bay represented

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,439
very much product based idea and Planck

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,909
epoch new represented a very community

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,490
or movement based idea and they separate

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:44,460
from each other on certain key points

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:46,290
and me and Thomas will switch sort of by

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,710
the by and he will explain the product

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:53,159
bit and I will explain it movement bit

00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:57,060
moments specifically focus on a larger

00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,270
grander goal that is part of what they

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,030
do they focus more on the group than the

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,820
product they focus on what do we do and

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,829
what is our grand goal the thing we

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,440
really really want to achieve but we

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,319
kind of assume we won't be able to an

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,920
example with Planck epoch know which

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,819
say free public traffic or public

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,030
transport idea and the goal there is to

00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:25,069
create a free public transport for all

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,530
they know they probably won't reach it

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,200
yes yet but instead of looking at

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,420
specific products or specific actions

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,879
they can do they look at the overarching

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,389
goal and how they can sort of achieve it

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:42,799
by doing smaller different tasks and

00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:44,989
even laptop just locked up bit by bit

00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:47,659
this will make perfect sense we will go

00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:50,540
by a bit by bit and Thomas here will go

00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:53,239
by the background of products the second

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,209
event wonderful this is switch forward

00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:01,189
keep moving okay well there we go you

00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:06,400
can start with your back okay oh yeah so

00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:10,000
the light weight you there yeah so the

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,280
context of the product perspective then

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,870
when you say product in a free software

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:21,979
community there you may get some people

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,290
a bit cautious because for example new

00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:26,389
recommends to not to avoid the term

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,220
software industry they have the whole

00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:30,560
list of toy terms you should avoid

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,379
because they have some negative

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,750
connotations or something one of those

00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:38,329
is software industry because they say

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:42,590
that industry makes it sound like we're

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:44,989
all somewhere in a factory working on a

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,720
car or whatever which then has to be

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,409
sold and if you can't sell it then it's

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,599
bad and there are limited resources

00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:56,180
going into a car and and all these

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,430
things and they say that well the free

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,930
software movement is quite different

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:05,049
from that then of course product is a

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,060
term that is often used in the industry

00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:12,319
because it's very very important for

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:14,989
them but it's not necessarily as closely

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,729
connected to something that is

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,769
necessarily sold of course for the

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:20,810
industry it is something that is old but

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,210
a product does not necessarily have to

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:28,130
be something that is sold

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:29,300
marketing literature then defines or one

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,669
of the definitions of marketing

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,620
literature is that a product is anything

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:37,190
that can be offered to a market that

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,110
might satisfy want or need so this is

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,919
something that gets much closer to what

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:45,590
we're doing because or market again

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,620
sounds a bit like money being exchanged

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:51,770
but it doesn't necessarily have to be

00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,139
that way and so for us the market is

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,800
more like the target audience and of

00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:59,330
course we do want to satisfy a want a

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,770
need of a target audience because

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:08,080
otherwise what's the point of doing

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:10,880
something whereas the product based

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,530
ideal is essentially looking at the

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,270
product that you're producing looking at

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,190
the thing that you're doing if it's for

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,590
example in open source we do an

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,380
application and we sort of finish that

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,780
one instead of doing that the movement

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,220
perspective basis itself completely on

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,840
the movement itself take Free Software

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,930
Foundation again Free Software

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,590
Foundation wants to as an overarching

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,800
massive almost utopian goal make

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:39,289
everything open source free information

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,030
free culture etc they know they're not

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,810
going to reach it tomorrow but instead

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,909
instead they focus on products or

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,789
smaller projects that they know they can

00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:51,889
achieve they have for example like it's

00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:54,440
small stickers for example that they

00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:57,139
give out or they do these conferences

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,240
they have smaller smaller products that

00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:02,780
might eventually leave to this grander

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,610
overarching goal and one of the focuses

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,400
instead of the product that you're

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,710
producing is the people that are doing

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,800
it because you're trying to actually

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,210
make this movement bigger you're trying

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,120
to get more people involved you're

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,789
trying to focus the group and the goal

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,409
is instead of doing one product and

00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:23,870
finishing it then being done with it is

00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:26,570
looking how the product fits into this

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:29,030
overarching relevant goal that you're

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,159
actually focusing on and so you take

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,479
this overarching goal let's take every

00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:34,129
software foundation you want to create

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,229
open source

00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:38,599
and within it this movement that you

00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:41,029
created you create subgroups and

00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,339
projects things that you think will push

00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:46,009
this goal forward or rather closer to

00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:50,229
you and you have short and mid term

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:53,419
goals to sort of define what it is sorry

00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:55,399
I'm looking at even as well short the

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:57,830
mid term goals that will sort of define

00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:00,649
how well you're sort of going towards

00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,809
that grander goal not you're not

00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:07,189
expecting to reach it you're more or

00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:09,259
less expecting to go towards it one of

00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:12,110
the focuses as well is also on group

00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:14,059
dynamics instead of looking at how well

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,309
did we do this product you look at how

00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:18,919
well the group perform how well do we

00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:20,779
move towards this goal how many people

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,569
know it is such there is a very clear

00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:26,539
difference in the focus between product

00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:28,909
and movement a movement has is more

00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:34,969
about the people involved and less about

00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:37,579
the product they produce I think so yeah

00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:40,099
from a from a product perspective what

00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:43,149
you want to do is of course reach people

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:46,279
because yeah without which is for the

00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:48,909
industry it's their market follows it's

00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:52,789
just yeah target target audience users

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:55,610
and very important part is you you want

00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:58,789
to provide people value so if you do

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,319
something just for its own sake from a

00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:04,099
product perspective it's completely

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,929
useless they it only makes sense to

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:08,419
produce a product if you can really show

00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:12,619
that okay this brings value to at least

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:14,629
some people then of course when you have

00:08:12,619 --> 00:08:16,579
a product that provides value you also

00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:19,610
of course want to make people use your

00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:25,599
product otherwise what's the point again

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:28,459
and yeah that I've come in from from a

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,659
classic commercial entity of course you

00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:34,699
want them to pay you but getting money

00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,659
is not the only thing you can you can

00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:42,469
get back in the in the open source world

00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:45,350
giving back of means just ranging from

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,480
just simply riding a bug report about

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,449
something

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,810
to contributing themselves at some point

00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:56,350
but it can also be money in the form of

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:58,180
donations so any way of getting people

00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,560
to think oh this is so cool i want to

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,000
give something back and this is

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,399
something that we that we often

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,560
experience that people come to us and

00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,120
say I want to give back I like it so

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,949
much the how can I give back and this is

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:14,949
the point where you've succeeded unlike

00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:17,290
the product based thing the movement

00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:20,680
perspective has very different like I

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:23,440
said a different focus on people and the

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,339
way you handle products and it also

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,209
requires certain steps to function it

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:33,040
also requires a certain level of I would

00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,930
like to say cruelty because that's part

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,790
of it the first thing you do you create

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,290
that goal you create that overarching

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,480
goal like for example we want all

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,360
computers to be open source for example

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,970
from hardware and up that that would be

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,100
a weird go we would all go of Jesus but

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,970
you know that's decades and decades away

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,220
at best and after that you've made that

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,380
goal large enough that everyone in the

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,779
group agrees with you define the group

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,639
you say okay we're the group we all want

00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,440
the same thing we all act somewhat the

00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,120
same thing but it also define who's not

00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,339
in a group for example if you have that

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,019
overarching goal and you're very strict

00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,300
about the free software ideas for

00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:12,190
example you don't want anyone going yeah

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,920
but I'm going to use a little bit of

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:17,260
this proprietary bit and it's good to

00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,819
tell that person in that case no no no

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,760
no that's not the goal of this group

00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:23,680
we're doing this long term thing and

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,260
it's fine to do that that's one of the

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,540
key elements of it being able to say

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,980
what we're not which sounds really cool

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,410
and it sounds really horrible but that's

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,240
the only way to actually keep a sort of

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,029
focus otherwise it's just a group of

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,250
friends doing nothing the second thing

00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:41,860
or the third thing is that creation of

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,110
subtypes this is a sort of ongoing thing

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,490
you have to do a bit by bit you can't

00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,500
just go well these are the tests were

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,000
going to do but you want to see like oh

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,010
I have a cool project because if you

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,720
have that group a focus group on our one

00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:56,050
goal you have made sure that the group

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,079
is all at the same mindset and then you

00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,560
go well does anyone have a cool idea for

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:02,790
example

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:06,940
word Planck epoch know they're free

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:09,220
public transport system idea they did a

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,890
specific protest that's a sub that's

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,250
like a product more or less one protest

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,870
is one product it's not the whole idea

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,820
of the group but it's just one of them

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,400
and the upside is that they can do these

00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,080
things individually in the group because

00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,600
they're all focused on the same thing

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,990
the group has the same goal has the same

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,790
methodology and character and I don't

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,180
know how profit happens but it can

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,830
happen but there's a very clear

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,080
philosophical difference as well because

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,910
where our product when it ends for

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,760
example that may be problems we'll talk

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,650
about that later but where the movement

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,029
can sort of fail there's a plenty of

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,100
reasons for that to fail as well we'll

00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,350
talk about that later but the focus is

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,790
very clearly different like I said the

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,210
focus is more on the group and how the

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,430
group will evolve and change it focuses

00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,380
on the group interaction and products

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,900
are or protest for example in the

00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,970
left-wing context would be relevant but

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,820
they're not critical they don't have to

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,770
succeed they are free to fail in a

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,089
large-scale manner because you still

00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,640
learn something the groups that exist

00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:15,310
the goals did exist and you still can

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:22,750
move towards it that's the upside of it

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:25,870
in many ways the then the typical

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:30,010
procedure from a product perspective is

00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:33,610
that first you need to find out about an

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,589
unsatisfied meet in the market so from a

00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:38,380
typical product perspective you don't

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:41,800
just go oh I have a nice idea I want to

00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:45,310
do this but it you was it it starts with

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:48,580
ideas but you an idea makes only sense

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:51,040
actually following if you can see that

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,610
ok then there is a need somewhere in the

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,940
world and which cannot be satisfied with

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:00,100
what exists and that's where you can say

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,730
ok this this is the the niche where we

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:06,310
can get in then once you have identified

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,980
that need you would define a product

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:11,670
vision so define what your product is

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:15,930
about why it's beneficial and two

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:18,540
um then yeah the the target audience

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:22,020
because you really have to be defined

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,730
whom it's for it might be a rather wide

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,100
audience it might be a very narrow

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,980
audience but if you haven't defined who

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,760
your product is for you're going to fail

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,790
at creating it properly then once you

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,430
have that ideally you should gather

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,970
requirements from the target audience

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:44,160
because you don't unless you're a member

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,830
of the target audience but even then you

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,430
shouldn't just base it on your own needs

00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:54,000
but really talk to people find out what

00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:56,940
they're doing what what tasks they have

00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,130
so it can really make your product work

00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:06,110
for them then comes the point where you

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:11,130
define your features and your view I and

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:13,560
you should do that again while talking

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,940
to to your target audience or two

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,090
members of your target audience you

00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,400
should do it iteratively and show things

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,740
to them have them try them out and to

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:28,370
behold what we call a human-centered

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:30,980
design process ideally there's an author

00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,450
Marty Kagan who wrote a lot about

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,320
product management and product design

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:40,050
and he says that there should be a

00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,760
product manager whose role is mostly to

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:46,050
know the market and to know what people

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:49,680
need there should be this one ux

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,990
specialist who knows how to design user

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,810
interface to work well for the target

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,740
audience and even in the design phase

00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,990
the development lead should already be

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,170
available so that you don't design

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,850
something which then later won't be

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,040
implementable but it makes sense to

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,670
together that also the technical

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:14,970
feedback at a rather early point so that

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,760
you don't throw something over the fence

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:20,880
and then the developer says well I can't

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,790
do that and then in worst-case just does

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,440
something else or the best case comes

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,060
back to you

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,600
you go back to the drawing board this is

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,790
not efficient at all so having everyone

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,150
responsible on board early on is very

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:38,270
helpful um yeah then cause you you

00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:41,660
create the products you ship the product

00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,910
and then you should measure whether it

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:49,100
has reached its goals but we can get to

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:51,890
that later so with the movement

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:55,910
perspective you have like I said a very

00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:59,000
different outlook mainly will this help

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:02,300
bring about the goal where capital

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,770
letters will help us bring us closer to

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,740
it with the Free Software Foundation if

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:10,430
they do say a specific communication

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,650
thing up event for example they will

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:16,090
look at will this actually bring us

00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:20,500
closer to free software as a all

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:23,150
encompassing or recovering no it's also

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,250
when they look at for example our

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,710
project like this one they have a

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,620
conference they will afterwards look at

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,600
will this did this actually moves closer

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,000
to the supper the conference goal like

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,860
the conference can have their own

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
sub-goal it always leads the same point

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,390
that grand the goal but it still can

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,090
have tiny tiny small tasks and then

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,010
after that you look at will this help

00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:48,080
the movement or the group as in for

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,240
example me and Thomas here standing and

00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,320
talking this is we're in this situation

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,350
a movement we have a sub project which

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,470
is to give this talk and from our point

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:03,650
of view will this help us convey other

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,360
people about these ideas and there's

00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,040
different ways to measure the success

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,829
but one of the things to measure it is

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,660
how well did is go for us will Thomas go

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,939
outside and slap me for example because

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,500
he's really annoyed with the way I talk

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:17,180
that's not good we'll really think like

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,560
this was a sort of bonding experience

00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,470
that means we might work better in the

00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,930
future etc it's actually a sort of sub

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,120
task of every single project will it

00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:29,420
help the group that's act that can

00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,820
actually justify a crappy product if it

00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,800
helps the group sort of unify work

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,870
better next time that's in itself a good

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,809
thing

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,580
and then finally is will it make people

00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:42,100
notice the subgroup and perhaps want to

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,920
join that's a secondary or in this case

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,930
a fourth goal there's a lot of different

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,559
ways to measure success which of course

00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:53,559
comes with a lot of downsides Thomas

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:57,100
let's see if you wanna the product then

00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:59,650
yeah well measuring success measuring a

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:04,330
product success you usually want to have

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:06,160
quite specific ways so yeah the most

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,040
important thing is of course does it

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,320
actually satisfy the target audiences

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,590
needs that you have identified earlier

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,830
if it doesn't then yeah it's a failure

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:20,530
unless by accident it satisfies some

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,320
other neat this can happen as well but

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,790
then you were just lucky then of course

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,200
our users happy with your product and

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,770
satisfying needs is one thing but you

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,070
really want them to be happy about it

00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:39,250
then of course does the mean then again

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:42,010
in a typical industry case it would be

00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,530
does itself in our case it's usually

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:48,610
does usage increase do we notice that

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:51,220
people download our software or now then

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,620
or use our service or whatever we're

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,770
doing if that doesn't happen then

00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:59,620
something obviously went wrong and yeah

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:03,850
then again if you you always hope that

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:05,590
people are giving back for one reason is

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,970
that of course you want you hope that

00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,620
you're getting something back but also

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,800
because that's also an indicator of

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,480
success and people being so happy that

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,470
they don't just use it but want to give

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,900
back in some way then ideally you have

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:24,880
specific metrics so when you where you

00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:27,400
can collect usage data or at least track

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,550
the number of downloads or if you are in

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:36,179
some software store you can you have the

00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:39,429
the metrics of reviews and scores and so

00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:41,650
yeah measuring the success and a

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:44,320
specific away as possible is actually

00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:46,630
really helping you to to see should I

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,850
continue with this or so that maybe

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,370
change something fundamentally or if it

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:56,320
goes all wrong then maybe just give up

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:58,360
and do something else there are with

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,290
both perspectives there are drawbacks

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,790
and there are gains their difference

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,620
with the drawbacks of the movement

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,780
perspective as you all can probably gain

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,240
from this wishy washy language of this

00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:13,750
almost hit bsq we're a movement is that

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,820
it's almost it's extremely tricky to

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,680
measure success properly it's very easy

00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,080
for people to go well we're better

00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,080
friends now so this worked well and that

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,570
might be our might justify it but it's

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,260
not going to be the end-all be-all any

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:31,660
sub project it's vague diffuse it's very

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,390
easy for example if me and even creates

00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,130
a group we could decide that we make our

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,690
own rules of who should be a part and

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,330
who shouldn't be a part we can change it

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:43,450
oh I like that person so you can be on

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:46,450
board anyway it can be easily subverted

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,730
and changed it's very excluding as well

00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,350
it's very excluding because someone will

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,970
always get hurt when you tell them no no

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,860
no no you can't be part of this group

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:56,310
I'm not interested in having you here

00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:00,940
and it can easily be hurtful and bad and

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:03,490
it tends to start new sub-projects

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,170
really quickly and end them really

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,510
quickly like you can have new

00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,940
sub-projects popping up every day and

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,370
it's just vapor it's nonsense nothing

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,260
really happens from it the upside is

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,090
that its way simply to start something

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,920
because everyone can do it autonomously

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,960
we all know the direction we're going we

00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,730
all know what kind of group we are so we

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,290
can also trust for example watching

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,980
wrestling to do his thing and he starts

00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,330
a project or a project and we all agree

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,980
that very well it's Martin he's in the

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,490
group is fine let him do his thing and

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,810
we all feel that we have some sort of

00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:37,180
responsibility for what he does but we

00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:40,450
allow him to do himself so it's easy to

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,070
start things there's it's easier to do

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,900
different things and indeed individual

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,640
endeavors because we again we all trust

00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,030
each other we all have the same goal and

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,190
methodology

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,990
it's easier to join which is a little

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,000
bit weird because it's also excluding

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,650
but it's easier because everyone can see

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,690
oh this is what they're about they're

00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,460
very clear about what they are what

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,140
they're not and you don't have to

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,460
actually do anything to join you just

00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,010
have to be ready to join the group and

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,200
agree with them and it's also a cricket

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,420
production that's one of the great up

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,160
sites is that it's very easy to start

00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,960
new things and you just finish them

00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,090
really quickly and just hammer them away

00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,980
so you get a quick production because

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:20,840
you trust each other you can always jump

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:23,270
across products and projects then some

00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,360
games and drawbacks from the product

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:28,400
perspective the the biggest game

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,400
probably is that your focus on providing

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,440
value it's not just people doing things

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,570
because they like doing things but you

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,330
always focus on okay does does that

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:41,270
actually bring any benefit to my users

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:45,590
and yeah you focus on the users

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:47,810
themselves so proper product design

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,780
cannot be done without knowing your

00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:53,930
users and so yeah make some focus on you

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:56,870
and you can have very clear measures of

00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:59,860
success as i already said before which

00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,840
can really be helpful in the feedback

00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:05,060
yeah then of course the one one big

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,430
disadvantage of you only focus on one

00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,860
product at a time is that you might lose

00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:12,650
sight of the big picture because usually

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:15,620
when you might for example the VLC

00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,540
community they have there is one very

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,490
successful product and they it is fine

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,280
for them just focus on that product

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:25,460
because it's just it's a big goal in

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,650
itself but if you focus on only smaller

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:31,540
products then there might yeah you might

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,540
lose sight of the big picture and

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,580
motivation might not extend beyond the

00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,410
product so if Jen said you really do it

00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,620
like okay I want to do that and if it's

00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,810
if it's good then I'm done then people

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,800
might just lose interest unless they

00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:51,890
find a new product to work on and yeah

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,470
if you if you do it really properly the

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,810
whole product management design thing

00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,850
then some contributors might feel overly

00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,050
controlled because you tell them well

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,120
this does not

00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,700
help the user you should not do it and

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,830
then write it but I want to do it and

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:13,070
then yeah that's this may create

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:14,990
conflict that is that's them one of the

00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,970
things that the reason we brought it up

00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,850
as a twofer more or less why we're both

00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,990
here is that the great upside we both of

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,900
these things is that they can be

00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:26,870
intermingle in many ways it the greatest

00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:29,960
upside with them is compared to having

00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:32,420
no principal at all and i'm not saying

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,430
kitty and all everyone here don't have

00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,940
that but having no vision having no

00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:40,580
principal at all is worse is always

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,050
worse if you think movement for example

00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,640
it's a bit of a hippie thing or a

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,280
product it's a bit of a business many

00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,110
thing ensure but it's better than having

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,150
nothing and both of these can be

00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,530
intermingled easily they can be changed

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,930
it can be moved around that you can't

00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,520
can be combined easily different people

00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:58,550
within the same group can do different

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,050
things and the relevant thing that we

00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:03,980
want to talk about these are just two

00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:05,960
methods by the way but we need as Katie

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,480
specifically we need these things we

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,850
need these visions we need that an idea

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,030
of how to move forward how to expand and

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:15,320
if it's the hippy method I don't want to

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,880
call it the hippy method but it is the

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,860
hippy method if it's the hippy method

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,390
then that's fine that's awesome if it's

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,890
the business money effort I don't want

00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:26,540
to call it that either then that's fine

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:28,160
too but we need something we need

00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,600
something to move forward otherwise

00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,730
we're going to be stuck in the same

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,290
malaise the same constant what are we

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,140
doing right now along a lot there are a

00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:39,620
lot of talks going on here and later

00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:41,510
this week about vision about ideas had

00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,370
to drive katie forward I've talked a lot

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,070
about with individual people out in the

00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:48,470
corridors everyone has an opinion but

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,660
Katie specifically what we absolutely

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:54,260
need and what every project project need

00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,750
is to get off our arses and define

00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,730
something that's the important bit it

00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,960
doesn't have to be perfect just has to

00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:03,590
be because otherwise we're just

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:07,750
floundering I think that sums it up yep

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,750
thank you for us small upload

00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:18,940
kids is are there any questions we have

00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:22,450
a few minutes for questions do you think

00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:25,330
it refers somehow also to the passer and

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,850
Cathedral like if I listen to you i

00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:32,020
think the movement is kind of the

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:35,320
cathedral thing yeah sure I don't mind

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:37,270
like the thing is for me is that I would

00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,220
never be completely strict with either

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,740
method I think but it has to be

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,470
something has to be and if for example

00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,390
people will say ok dr such hippies doing

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,430
this thing or being very excluding

00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,290
because we have this grand goal and we

00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,170
kick people out that's better than

00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:55,450
nothing and yeah this has connotations

00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:59,410
that might not be grand and perfect but

00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:03,010
it'll be good you'll be awesome any

00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:08,010
other questions no then let's have some

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,010
