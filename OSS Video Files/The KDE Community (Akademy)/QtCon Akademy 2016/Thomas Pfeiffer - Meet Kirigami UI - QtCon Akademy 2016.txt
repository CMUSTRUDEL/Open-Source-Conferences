good morning everyone today you're here

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,200
Thomas Pfeiffer our chief design

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,360
usability officer and Marco Martin our

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,230
chicks didn't chip technological officer

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,580
Wright talking about one of the latest

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:25,619
KD frameworks project called kirigami

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:36,559
now thanks to the introduction and

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:42,360
welcome Oh keep our focus okay let's so

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:46,940
yeah what what is Kagame Kagame is a

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:50,100
framework of components for creating

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:55,800
mobile and convergent applications based

00:00:50,100 --> 00:01:00,120
on cute and the trick about it is that

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,699
is not just for creating any any user

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,439
interface it is based on the design

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,729
guidelines that were originally created

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:11,220
for plasma mobile applications but yeah

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:16,380
it can be useful for for any mobile and

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:18,509
convergent application you can see yeah

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,750
we have drawn up some some guidelines

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,000
for user interface design put them on

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,590
wiki and then wanted a fast way to

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,130
implement these design guidelines and as

00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:34,560
we know people sometimes the the easier

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,210
it is to get something right the more

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,119
likely it is so we created for every

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,740
guideline we have we have a matching

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:51,960
control or component in a repository

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:55,320
Kagame but get um and yeah the plan the

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,600
plan is to make it a proper KDE

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,170
framework the KT frameworks are in

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,600
several tiers which means that the ones

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,750
on the higher tiers can depend on others

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,239
on lower tiers and kagami will be a tier

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,360
1 framework which means that the only

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,190
dependency

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,600
have when creating an application with

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:20,640
kirigami is cute and that's it and the

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,890
the goal was to not only have it work on

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,870
desktop linux and plasma mobile but also

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:32,470
on android on the ubuntu phone and in

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,950
general unity 8 want to touch devices on

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:43,170
Windows and I on iOS and maybe other

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:46,540
platforms ones that become important and

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,840
so first the basic assumptions that were

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,900
behind the design guidelines Oh what we

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,900
want is convergence so the same

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,120
application should run on both mobile

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,270
and desktop applications and of course

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,989
also on devices which basically can turn

00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:08,230
from a touch-based device to a pointer

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:10,989
and keyboard based device but we don't

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,700
when that you can you can see in the

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:15,910
industry there are some approaches which

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,130
more or less just scale an application

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:21,100
up and down when it switched when for

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:25,269
example a big screen and mouse and

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,530
keyboard is attached to a smartphone but

00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:28,540
we don't think that is the right

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,870
approach and that there should be as

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,690
much reuse as possible but the the oh I

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:39,070
has to be optimized for each form factor

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:42,310
and each each input for example a phone

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:45,910
or tablet's you I can be can use lots of

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,650
gestures to do things and this is often

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,450
important to use dress just because you

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,370
don't have a lot of space on your user

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,989
interface where it's when you're using

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,760
mouse and keyboard then of course you

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:58,060
don't want to use gestures because

00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,090
they're very awkward so whenever you

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,860
turn to a mouse and keyboard input you

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,700
should get controls which are more

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:09,100
suitable for mouse and keyboard or also

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,850
depending on the space for example deck

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:15,400
on phone you want to hide away as much

00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,600
as possible of the controls when you

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,580
don't need them because you need the

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,109
space whereas on desktop where we have

00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,360
more space you can have things

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:23,950
permanently shown and we have

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,650
implemented such things

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,350
the framework but it still was to

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,990
encourage people to optimize the the UI

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:36,070
manually for each form factor so that it

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:39,900
really works well and yeah the next one

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:43,480
is we made the assumption that

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,610
especially mobile devices where as they

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,440
can be used for content creation they

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,530
are more suitable for content

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:56,020
consumption so you can maybe create

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,460
write a whole book on a phone but for

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,370
most people it's still more comfortable

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:04,870
to do that at the pc but then review it

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:08,260
for example on the phone that's also why

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,530
yeah we wanted to give as much space as

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,900
possible to the actual content

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,730
especially on a phone and to some extent

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,620
on the tablet depending on the size you

00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,140
don't want yo you I to be full of

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,420
controls all the time and you want the

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,900
space for the content and that's why

00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,900
most of the actual controls are only

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,270
shown when they're needed and one thing

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:35,170
we wanted to optimize for one-handed use

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,930
so that in a really casual setting or

00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:40,120
when for example on public

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,000
transportation you might want to have

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,220
one hand free to do other things and in

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,730
most of the cases are not that people

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,010
when they hold the phone in one hand do

00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:55,870
it in a way that then they use the thumb

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:59,140
to to interact with the with you I and

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,020
the thumb cannot reach the top parts of

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,180
the screen easily so we optimized it in

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,820
a way that you can reach almost

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,350
everything with yours umph even if you

00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:13,140
can't reach the top and then one one big

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,290
part is that we optimized for

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:19,950
hierarchically organized content because

00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:22,480
realize that in many occasions be it um

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:26,129
browsing through a file system or

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,949
through music library or through

00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:31,439
an email which is a email account which

00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,539
as folders they often have

00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,069
hierarchically organized content which

00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,110
means when you navigate through it you

00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:39,959
often go back and forth between the

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,089
levels of the hierarchy so we optimized

00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:48,569
kirigami to be able to do that very

00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:51,330
easily and yeah so these this is what we

00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:57,769
what we wanted to achieve with the

00:06:51,330 --> 00:07:02,159
components and the guidelines okay so as

00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:05,509
at least as imagined important as what

00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:10,769
gear gum is for and what Garriga me is

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:16,550
to define it needs also to be said what

00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:20,490
it's not and what is not for we can

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,999
wonder why doing another control set

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,939
when there is already kid controls and

00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:32,610
now get quick controls to in fact

00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:36,079
kirigami is not a a full component set

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:39,990
for things like buttons text boxes and

00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:43,649
text and things like that use cute quick

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:48,629
controls or keep Quinn controls to if

00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:54,149
you can use get 5.7 the goal of kirigami

00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:56,399
is to be an extension of cute quick

00:07:54,149 --> 00:08:00,059
controls that place as good as possible

00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:05,309
with it that implements the human

00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:11,249
interface guidelines that are defined by

00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:14,550
the visual working group so if you think

00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:18,059
these design language is good for your

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,119
application then it's for you if you if

00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:23,610
you need to implement something

00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:26,699
completely different or some some

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:31,419
particular design that doesn't really

00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:36,770
then it's probably probably not for you

00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:40,839
at at the moment we released a one

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:44,000
standard standalone release before

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:47,750
starting the process to integrate into

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,830
framework and pens from cute quick

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:56,149
controls one because we wanted to

00:08:50,830 --> 00:09:03,370
advocacy boss also with cute 5.6 as is a

00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:07,279
long term release then we started also a

00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:09,410
migration of a new version that would be

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:15,709
to install able just different version

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:21,200
of the import that migrates it to quit

00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:24,050
controls to it it's already the part

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:31,070
that we migrated it's already way

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:33,560
simpler code since since it's it's the

00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:37,420
the goal of cute controls to and makes

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:42,980
it easy for us to get rid of a lot of

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:46,160
complicated kimmel code and the but the

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:50,480
API Eva even on the release the version

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:54,410
1 the API is as we design it as similar

00:09:50,480 --> 00:10:04,900
as possible to Witkin with cute quick

00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:09,890
controls to API we will now see and the

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:11,930
some of the classes that we have in

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:16,510
kirigami one by one at least the most

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:20,329
important why class by class because we

00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:26,420
designed the API that it's a so coupled

00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:31,790
with the with the design that the vdg is

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:35,020
defined that basically apart some some

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,020
minor helpers

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:44,070
the classes pretty much correspond one

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:49,890
two one two a visual concept they

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:52,830
designed so first application we know

00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:55,490
that one of the implemented

00:10:52,830 --> 00:11:04,260
implementation details I'll Perseids

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:08,070
it's what you are what you are supposed

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,950
to use as root object in a kilogram

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:16,140
application it just in ER it's for from

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:20,460
quick controls application window and

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:22,440
gives a couple of things more to make to

00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:28,470
make it easier to to implement that

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:30,780
design language it it has a very simple

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:36,780
system of passive notifications that is

00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:42,090
that are just an overlay that are that

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:46,830
are notification that are are designed

00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:51,590
for a very narrow use case so if you are

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:54,480
that they're not to be to replace the

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,200
global system notification if you are in

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,250
doubt whatever one or the other to use

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:05,540
ask the visual design group there are

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:11,310
usability reasons for one or the other

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:14,940
then it exposes properties for drivers

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:21,830
that means that the this application

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:26,400
window requires is still optional but

00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:28,940
encourages for the application developer

00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:34,400
to add to side rowers that we will

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:37,170
explain later what they are but we made

00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:43,690
explicit indeed in the API that you

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:48,970
should probably use them last last part

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:53,170
page page navigation basically

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:55,880
everything in the application is

00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,680
subdivided in pages it's the same

00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:02,089
concept that it sink you could control

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:06,320
too and there is a particular gesture

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:10,399
based system to navigate to them maybe

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,149
Thomas as something to add on that so as

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,500
I already said earlier we wanted to make

00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:18,050
navigation to a hierarchy back and forth

00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,880
as easy as possible and that's why with

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:25,430
with this setting navigating between

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,310
pages is basically like horizontal

00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:30,529
scrolling so that let's agree with a

00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,910
swipe to the left and right you can

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:35,000
navigate back and forth between

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,500
different pages which men represent

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,720
different levels of the hierarchy or

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,519
also if you have a linear process it's

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,209
just going back and forth between steps

00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:47,089
of that process you can it is already

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:50,450
implemented in some Android applications

00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:52,490
as well though most of them there you

00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:56,450
often can go back with a swipe but you

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:58,339
can't go forward again which is okay for

00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:01,070
some occasions but sometimes you don't

00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:03,020
want you just want to get a sneak peak

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,880
at for example when you have a list of

00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,410
conversations and you go into one

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,240
conversation then you want to quickly

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,640
check okay how many messages are there

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,550
and other conversations but then want to

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,860
go back to the previous then on most

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,839
Android applications you have to find it

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,029
again and tap it again whereas in our

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,920
case you can just swipe back to the

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:31,100
other the other direction and go back to

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:34,930
where you were before okay so we said

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:38,690
the central thing is a thing called page

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:42,949
it's a concept that is present also

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:47,690
include quick controls to what we became

00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:52,029
will became a subclass over with quick

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:55,550
controls to page and it has one

00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:59,690
particular important thing on

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:07,399
of all the standard page that is the

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:10,700
concept of actions there are there can

00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,339
be some actions that are contextual to

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:20,420
the to the page that you are in at the

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:26,060
moment and can be either a most reaction

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:31,190
that are that are the main ones that

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:35,320
will will look like what in android is

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:40,700
called floating action button i think

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:44,329
and a group of secondary action that you

00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:48,170
can have as many as you want that will

00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:51,339
appear in a context menu in our case in

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:56,959
a in a drawer in in android is what

00:15:51,339 --> 00:16:03,350
appears by tapping the top right three

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:05,839
dots three dot menus it's their

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:10,790
definition it's completely semantic you

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:15,290
cannot really influence that much how

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:21,860
they look it's a group property gel just

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:25,190
like for instance anchors so you here is

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,410
is defining a page then at the bottom

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:36,260
you can put the content you want in the

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:38,480
page then defines actions we have a main

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,790
one that will be the biggest button then

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,690
you can have one or two left on or the

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:48,110
right I can I can show a running

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:50,690
application later and a list of

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,970
contextual actions that can be it's a

00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,750
it's a list property so can be as many

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,750
as you want

00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:12,620
is ok this is a is an application that

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:16,730
is running in mobile mod that was just

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:18,769
more it would it would look a bit

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:23,569
different if it was in destin mod but

00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:26,740
basically those bot bottom three buttons

00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:33,200
are the main left and right action and

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:36,470
at the and the other drawer that the the

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:43,429
list of the actions that you that you

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:46,480
defined i think now we have the

00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:49,909
scrolling page that it's a specialized

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:55,070
version of the page that may be too much

00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:59,090
more to say about it so this is one of

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:03,710
what we found out most many applications

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:06,850
actually show lists of something can be

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:11,360
for example yeah again emails messages

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:13,309
whatever and yeah often they are longer

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,860
than the screen especially other on the

00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:18,320
phone so they have to be scrolling but

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,669
then as i said we wanted to optimize for

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,940
one-handed use in which reaching the top

00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:28,820
of the screen is not easy so that's why

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,059
we did a bit similar to what iOS does as

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,240
well i have the possibility that you can

00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:37,789
if you scroll to the top of the list and

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,990
then dragged down further as you can see

00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:44,720
here the top of this of the UI comes

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,970
down so that you can both reach the top

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,000
elements of the dist which would be hard

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:53,330
to tap there and also can easily reach

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,100
the the header which is not just to show

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,909
you where you are but also as a

00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,880
navigational device because you can hand

00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:04,960
scroll that left and right and go

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,670
to any of the previous steps or add ones

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:16,410
that would come further if you have

00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:23,410
scrolled back okay then trowers I just

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:31,630
mentioned them before one central part

00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:36,550
of the of the interface guideline is the

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:39,250
concept of side drawers that it's a

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:43,710
concept that it's found all over the

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:47,200
place but in android and iOS as well

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:51,520
it's it's a it's a layer on top that

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:56,370
goes over the application content that

00:19:51,520 --> 00:20:00,370
you can have a second secondary controls

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:03,580
we have a base class that it's called

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:08,410
overlaid rower in which you can put

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:14,320
anything you want in it it it will

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:18,880
became in kilogram to as a plus of two

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:22,020
quick controls to draw our main thing it

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:27,100
adds besides a bit of styling is a

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:31,120
handle because we found that that very

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:35,320
often in mobile applications if if there

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,560
isn't something that always shows there

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,950
is a drawers that visually that can be

00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:50,080
open its content can be be easily

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:52,900
forgotten and yeah you can you can

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,770
define define to slide it from all the

00:20:52,900 --> 00:21:01,090
four or all the four sides sides but the

00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:06,100
most important thing is the specialized

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:09,030
grow draw our classes that we have the

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:11,850
first is global tower I

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:15,930
before you talk about it I want to see

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:23,790
if I can yes so instead of a screenshot

00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:34,680
can be just no prism but it's really

00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:41,190
tricky to to drive from here yeah they

00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:44,550
just use especially so yeah the global

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:48,080
draw is the one that holds the main menu

00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:51,570
of the application so anything that

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:56,310
should always be accessible no matter

00:21:51,570 --> 00:22:01,580
where you are in the application ed by

00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:04,230
default consists of header which

00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:07,560
optionally can show it's the nice

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:10,140
background image and a title which is in

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:18,600
most cases the name of the application

00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:22,560
and then the main part is the oh it's

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,530
the actual menu here um where you can

00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,420
just put the yeah the main actions it

00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:29,070
can have multi levels multiple levels as

00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:34,200
you can see here so you can have a

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:36,570
hierarchy of menu items and then above

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,720
it which is you can you can put other

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:42,000
elements in many cases this will be a

00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,270
search box so that you can search from

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,730
anywhere in your application and there

00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:50,280
can also be custom controls put at the

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,930
bottom if you want to have some some

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,150
options for example but you want to have

00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:59,670
always available then you can put them

00:22:54,150 --> 00:23:02,910
in the global draw as well okay so let's

00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:10,020
let's see her how is used from your

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:14,790
application you put it as the value of

00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:17,460
your global drawer in the application

00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:19,610
window if you are if you are using a

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,650
normal kid control application

00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,660
that you can just put it at the

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:28,840
attention to put it in the right layer

00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,840
that doesn't get anything on top of it

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:43,429
exactly as as we seen for the 40-page

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:47,540
actions the demesne you is is a

00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:52,790
described in a semantic way so it's it's

00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:56,929
a list property of actions and the

00:23:52,790 --> 00:24:00,220
action can also be nested one into

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:03,830
wanting to each other in this way you

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:09,140
you obtain the a multi-level der article

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:11,960
menu in the in the guidelines though it

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,660
it recommends do not use more than two

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:20,140
really maximum maximum three levels but

00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:28,929
it's just for usability these are action

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:28,929
type inherits from cupid control action

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,990
unfortunately keep the controls to

00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:40,370
doesn't have one for now so we will

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:44,900
probably need to depend from it for a

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:51,980
while still but it's something that I

00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:55,220
think it it would be really the case to

00:24:51,980 --> 00:25:00,559
to have it upstream dinky controls to as

00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:05,960
well we cannot just completely or

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:09,919
implement it as it needs private cute

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:14,990
API for correctly managing the keyboard

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,190
shortcuts if there is any besides the

00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:19,909
actions

00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:25,779
you can put the title the icon the top

00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:32,389
banner is any URL that an image type can

00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:35,090
I can accept you can put arbitrary items

00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:38,120
either on the bottom or on the top of

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:41,840
the menu and just just to find the items

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,360
and and it works the other important

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:49,490
driver drawer type is the context roller

00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:52,220
oh so the context draw wants any any

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,919
actions which are not important enough

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:58,759
to be on the menu I but which are

00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,620
dependent on the context so that this is

00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,509
where you put things that only affect

00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:07,639
the the object you're currently looking

00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:10,970
at and yeah we wanted to have a clear

00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:13,220
separation between global and contextual

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,159
actions so that users always know okay

00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,679
if it's something that affects what I'm

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,539
looking at now I know I can find it in

00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,909
the context draw if it's something

00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:27,139
that's their independent of the context

00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:30,110
I can find it in the global one yeah see

00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:33,799
you can see here the reactions actually

00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:36,200
at the at the bottom by default also to

00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:43,129
make it easier to access them with one

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:44,929
thumb yeah and again you can either open

00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:47,120
it with the handle of it that you can

00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:49,399
see that the bottom or just slide in

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,990
from the right so this is a important

00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,750
difference from for example material

00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:56,870
design which does have the the overflow

00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:59,840
menu to hold additional actions but

00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:02,330
those can only be accessed from that

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,549
tiny little button at the top right of

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,289
the screen which makes it again more

00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:08,779
difficult to use with one hand and we

00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:13,009
made sure that these edge dishes are

00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:18,019
available for both okay so technically

00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:24,350
this is defined with if I find again

00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:29,259
yeah yes defined by the contextual

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:29,259
actions Lister that you put in the page

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:39,620
all it will need will be one context or

00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:43,549
drawer that it's put in the application

00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:46,510
window so as as here defines a global

00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:49,220
drawer as this one you just define a

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:54,590
context row where as a context drawer

00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:58,809
instance and without doing anything else

00:27:54,590 --> 00:28:02,150
then its content will be populated with

00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:06,260
whatever the action are of the current

00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:12,620
page then yeah you can also have other

00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:14,630
customers Thomas then yeah one one

00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:18,140
example of a custom draws the the button

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:21,020
draw which can be used for some quick

00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:23,720
dialogue which should not cover the

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,480
whole screen but just slide in from the

00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:30,440
from the button you quickly decide yes

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:34,730
or no for something and then it goes

00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:37,429
away again or you can close it easily so

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:40,580
that is yeah something that can also be

00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:45,890
found in material design applications

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:52,520
and yeah it is nice to not only it not

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:56,090
always show a full dialogue then the

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:59,750
this the overlay sheet is kind of the

00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:02,690
full dialogue advantages that it can be

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,130
as as high as you want so it doesn't

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:07,580
have to fit the content doesn't have to

00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:09,950
fit on the screen so if you have that

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:15,530
long long content you want to show in an

00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:17,030
overlay it can just scroll yeah there's

00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,650
more at the bottom as you can see here

00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,600
you can just scroll it to show

00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:23,600
everything and it but it still can be

00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,730
easily dismissed by just they are

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,789
pushing it away so that is that is the

00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:31,940
way to ya quickly show additional

00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:39,710
contact content without leaving the the

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:41,980
context that you are in the technically

00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:46,660
just

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:48,760
a couple of things so yeah you you can

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,730
have these just two best thing because

00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:57,790
it's basically a big flickable by

00:29:51,730 --> 00:30:02,380
default the graphics of the takes

00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:09,010
the whole page but by defining the

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:13,540
implicit implicit width of the of the

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:15,910
main content you can you can have you

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:20,320
cannot you can have it also narrower so

00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:23,230
it will have it will have an empty area

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,730
on the left and on the right let's see

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:31,600
if I can have one that it's working so

00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:38,470
basically um yeah it's just a big sheet

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:41,440
of things and you can you can dismiss it

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:49,799
either clicking by clicking on a on an

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:49,799
empty area or just throwing it away okay

00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:58,410
yeah primary action button that's

00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:07,630
basically what I we talked before about

00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:11,799
okay and it's a it's those controls at

00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:14,500
the bottom they can they can be

00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:22,720
triggered to to doing a particular

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:25,960
action those are defined in the in the

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,140
page as well in fact if I if I go back

00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:34,020
the D whole button it's also scrolling

00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:37,450
away because it belongs to to that page

00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:43,179
you don't have direct access to this

00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:47,860
class is just gets created when you when

00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:52,419
you define the primary and secondary

00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:53,560
actions so these are used for actions

00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:57,220
that are important

00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:59,530
have to always be visible and it also

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,260
doubles as an additional draw handle

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:04,480
because we found out that some users

00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:06,880
prefer to open the drawers from

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,410
something in the center of the screen so

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,530
they do not have to move the thumb to

00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:14,290
the edges of the screen that's why if

00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:16,660
there is a primary or secondary action

00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:32,220
buttons you can just drag them left and

00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:36,340
right to open the drawers yeah then this

00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:39,820
far out that in some cases you want to

00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:43,060
be able to execute actions on an element

00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:45,700
of a list without opening it so again

00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,580
typical example a list of emails um

00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,580
we're naturally usually if you would

00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:54,340
click on one email in the list it would

00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:55,810
open that email but you might see

00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,030
already from the title that you don't

00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:00,880
care about that email you want to delete

00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:03,370
it immediately for example and so in

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,230
this case this would make sense to have

00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:08,200
these these handles at the right which

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:12,430
you can just slide to the left or click

00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:15,640
to reveal additional actions so it

00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:19,600
basically fulfills a similar purpose to

00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:23,320
the to the context draw and in fact it

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,840
should not be combined with them because

00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:29,130
on the one hand it can be confusing

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,140
because people might not know where is

00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:34,270
which action is in there which action is

00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,160
in the context draw and there's also a

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,720
bit of a conflict because the the

00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,050
context or can be opened by an edge

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,150
swipe from the right which yeah made

00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:46,690
makes it a bit difficult when you also

00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:48,370
have these handles on the right so

00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:51,910
basically what you have to think about

00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:53,950
is do have contextual actions which only

00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:56,050
affect an element when it's already

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,740
opened and central on the screen or do

00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,630
we have context

00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,880
directions which users might want to

00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:04,290
trigger without opening the element and

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:11,200
so we have controls for both of these

00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:14,020
and just quickly I was used you use you

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,649
use the particulars wipe next item as a

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:21,429
delegate of a list of a list view and

00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:25,030
then as the page you just define a list

00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:27,760
of actions and define what to do when

00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:35,619
they are triggered and what icon they

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:39,369
are they have the oak idea it's okay so

00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:40,899
our case the the header is the typical

00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:43,090
element of mobile application so that

00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:45,700
you know where you are but in our case

00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,770
as i already said before it has dual

00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:51,210
purpose it's not just for showing way

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:53,980
off but also as a navigational element

00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,020
well that once you when you when you

00:34:53,980 --> 00:35:00,550
pull it down then you have easy access

00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:04,390
to it and can just go any step back or

00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:09,119
forward and the the hierarchy in one

00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:09,119
goal by just scrolling it left and right

00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:19,510
okay and then there are other as I said

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:23,700
little helpers that you can just look

00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:27,130
them up on the only API documentation

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:30,820
the important one as I said before is

00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:34,720
the is the action that represents

00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:37,840
semantically all things like the the

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,160
bottom buttons or the context menu or

00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:48,340
the actions in the swype list tighten

00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:55,480
the rest is is just a little controls

00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:58,000
that we that we needed but not much

00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,900
importantly the most deepen the most

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,250
important ones are those that we just

00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:11,650
went one by one so

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:17,470
getting billed is one thing that we that

00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:19,390
we found as a as a feedback from early

00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:24,280
adopter from people that were worth

00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:28,200
trying to use it on their android and

00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:34,750
and even more difficult iOS applications

00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:41,170
was that seems to not be still not be

00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:45,310
trivial at all to to use any kind of

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:48,700
third-party are done too cute it's it's

00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:52,750
very easy at in a linux distribution

00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:56,790
because it in everything you need it's

00:36:52,750 --> 00:37:01,690
already installed but for things like

00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:04,780
building or on android or on iOS there

00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:09,270
are still some some difficult so we

00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:15,070
ended up having four different ways to

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:17,980
build it most important is the

00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:21,880
distinction between avid built as a

00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:27,340
plug-in or everything built as a static

00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:29,580
library that seemed so far the only the

00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:36,040
only way that seemed to work correctly

00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:39,340
on iOS at least that was the and the

00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:43,600
feedback from the subsurface guys that

00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:45,490
it's the first very big application that

00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:56,350
it's using kirigami on multiple

00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:59,830
platforms so yeah as usual as any a KD

00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:02,980
KD framework you can build it with Simic

00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:06,220
as a plug-in that from your application

00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:10,330
you just do find package and that's it

00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:17,470
from Q make a cute plus kagame and they

00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:20,079
finds it awfully but if we'd see make

00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:24,729
you are the

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:30,200
the command-line switch static library

00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:33,890
it will it will be just a static library

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:36,769
then they in that case you would have to

00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:39,559
have a private copy of kilogram in your

00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:42,890
application at horrible but seems that

00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:47,420
some kind of application is for from

00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:49,309
mobile devices that's what they what

00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:53,900
they want for now I would like this

00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:56,989
situation to change but same thing in

00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:02,900
queue make there is a PRI file so you

00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:06,019
can just include it in from the queue

00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:08,690
make file in the in your project

00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:12,650
directory and it will build it as a

00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:17,839
static library this yeah very quick and

00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:20,329
dirty example you can include it may be

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:26,119
only on platforms that you can cannot

00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:30,309
read about it so if I oz then if it's

00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:34,700
static then it will not use the qml dear

00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:36,769
way of defining a plug-in so will we

00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:40,609
will have to register the tapes the

00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:42,319
tithe manually and there is that if it's

00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:45,559
building that way there is available

00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:51,109
this global static function that just

00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:57,680
does it again do these it only if you

00:39:51,109 --> 00:40:01,099
cannot avoid it namely iOS and it in the

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,489
in the in the same way we would see make

00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:10,489
you can statically linked what you built

00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:15,559
before yeah we have already quite a lot

00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:19,130
of users so the first external user of

00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:22,160
kirigami was subsurface which is a dive

00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:28,219
log application was originally created

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:30,670
by ministers and the Condor and it was

00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:32,810
started as a desktop application

00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:36,170
originally using ttk

00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:40,790
then later switched on to cute because

00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:42,440
it's more flexible as we know and then

00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,200
they at some point they wanted to do

00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,270
they had a companion app on Android

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,800
which was just could do only very few

00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:52,160
things but they realized that they

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,060
wanted an actual full-featured mobile

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,940
application and this is where they got

00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:01,100
in touch with with us especially Marco

00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:04,250
and save us who thought that hey this

00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:07,340
might be a good idea or a good example

00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,930
to put our or components that they had

00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:12,830
developed originally for plasma mobile

00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:15,680
into action and so we worked closely

00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:18,020
together with them to overcome initial

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,750
obstacles and to see what would need to

00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:25,580
be done to actually make it valuable

00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:27,770
also on other platforms and yeah the

00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:30,290
nice thing is that but since it's both

00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:32,090
cute they're the mobile version shares

00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,650
most of the backend code with the

00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:36,530
desktop version so they didn't have to

00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:39,050
rewrite any of that was really basically

00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:42,980
only the UI that they had to recreate

00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:46,850
for mobile and then some some platform

00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:49,880
specific things and also the it is

00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:55,220
already released on on Android confided

00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:57,440
on the Play Store and the iOS version is

00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:00,290
currently in better be mostly because

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,650
the other there are many difficulties

00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:07,130
when you first start with programming

00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:09,680
for iOS but those two the Android and

00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,140
the iOS version again share most of the

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,020
code even on the high side so they made

00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:17,660
a few adjustments for for iOS because

00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,580
some iOS users wanted some things in a

00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,190
different way but they could have just

00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,610
reuse the same coach to build both the

00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:28,930
Android at the iOS version and that

00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:33,140
would are of course also then run on

00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:37,250
Linux both desktop and also prefer

00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:39,050
mobile um yeah they said the very early

00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:41,090
adopter which allowed us a very good

00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,160
collaboration and it was important for

00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,860
our development because

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,920
we didn't develop kagame in a bubble

00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:50,850
only within our team but we got a lot of

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,590
feedback and they also had very

00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:55,750
enthusiastic better testers and users so

00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,330
we also get some very valuable user

00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:03,490
feedback and made some of many

00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:06,940
adjustments to the to our design and we

00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:09,010
also got very early on already patches

00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,050
so that that's really an example when

00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:14,200
you create a framework it makes sense to

00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:15,970
work with external projects early on and

00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:22,060
not just they are created within your

00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:25,660
own community is also the subsurface

00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:28,030
looks yes you can you can see you can

00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:32,680
see the the globe will draw them on the

00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:36,280
left and they're actually using a sheet

00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:38,740
so that they're making use of a of most

00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:44,050
of the components that we we offer and

00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:46,420
it integrates very well then yeah

00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:53,860
another example of a keg ami application

00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:57,850
is peru's which yeah is an in project

00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:01,900
done with it KDE the developer is here

00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:05,560
and it has already been released for

00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:07,960
desktop linux and on windows and the

00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:12,400
yeah the mobile version is currently in

00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:16,210
development then there is cube which is

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,910
a pimp personal information management

00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:22,150
application currently the first part is

00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:24,550
the email application and that is also

00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:28,060
in development for desktop linux for

00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:32,500
mobile and it's also supposed to work

00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:36,010
when on Windows OS X android/ios for

00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:39,400
them it's since it is supposed to become

00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:41,590
the standard client for kolob it is very

00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,510
important for the team that they can

00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:46,540
deploy it or pretty much any platform so

00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:50,560
looks only would not be enough for them

00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:52,810
and then we have discovered which is a

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,380
software store which is the the default

00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:58,160
software stuff apply

00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:04,400
long and it is also in development for

00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:06,410
desktop linux and for mobile so yeah

00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,080
here you can see some screenshots on the

00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:12,500
top left we have an early version of

00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:14,090
cube which already in just the

00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,060
screenshot get some very positive

00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:21,170
reviews and reactions from people then

00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:23,150
on the top right we have Bruce which if

00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:27,890
I haven't said it is a comic book reader

00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:29,720
as you can see and it's also what's very

00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:32,270
suitable for kirigami because it's

00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:37,810
mostly a content consumption application

00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:37,810
and then at the bottom you see discover

00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:45,950
yeah then the some feedback that we got

00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:49,490
so far someone said that the Android mo

00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:54,050
ka gamma gallery is running surprisingly

00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:57,860
fluidly on his nexus 7 tablet from 2012

00:45:54,050 --> 00:46:01,730
so it is not a resource hog in any way

00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:04,130
works also on all the devices yeah

00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:06,230
someone said he's excited by the slick

00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:08,180
looking kagami and the possibility of

00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:12,950
building applications on linux android

00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:19,430
and windows or would c c++ then one of

00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:23,030
the subsurface users said that while he

00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:26,210
found it took a bit of getting used to

00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:29,150
the different Navigation concepts but

00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:31,220
then even as an Android user he found

00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:33,170
that it didn't get long to get used to

00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,000
swiping the central button to open the

00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:37,490
drawers and then found it easy and

00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,250
comfortable to use and also very

00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:42,290
efficient because you can use it you can

00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:44,660
use one element both for executing

00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:48,080
executing an action and for opening both

00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:50,780
drawers and one of the feedbacks on the

00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:55,220
on subsurface was that it has a function

00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:58,600
but also beautiful design I don't either

00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:03,460
on the technical side we have few

00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:06,790
takeaways we started by doing it as

00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:11,950
a DUI framework for for plasma mobile

00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:16,390
and this is a steel one of our central

00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:19,930
goals but these wasn't enough if you if

00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:24,090
we wanted to attract many application

00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:28,020
developers so it really has to be

00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:33,990
something that can be used by anybody

00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:37,540
anywhere even we if we are pushing some

00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:40,660
key design elements of plasma mobile

00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:46,570
because we think there are they really

00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:49,930
make sense and also to Avonex access

00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:55,150
must be what in frameworks quality one

00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:58,540
doesn't cannot have any other dependency

00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:00,640
besides cute this makes some things more

00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:06,760
difficult because there are a lot of

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:10,990
awesome things that are provided by KD

00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:16,990
frameworks especially in IR tears but if

00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:19,780
you then if you use them it gets less

00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:27,340
usable for some for some kind of

00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:30,820
applications and yep so far most of the

00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:34,630
interest has come from people that want

00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:39,070
to use it use it for a developing mobile

00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:40,810
application mostly for Android since a

00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:43,450
building and the point on it it's

00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:45,670
getting white while ironed out a bit

00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:56,680
also fire for iOS but it's still a bit

00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:59,830
more difficult but what eid so didi the

00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:03,280
target is to make it a natural cheer one

00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:06,580
framework with that we had a standalone

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,710
release so far and that's and that's

00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:15,150
good also to get first

00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:18,540
first large-scale feedback and we also

00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:20,670
cannot do it right now we will have to

00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:22,440
depend for an e in order to do a

00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:26,700
transition to get quick answers to

00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:30,150
depend from cute 5.7 so we will do it

00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:34,080
when we will be able to put in

00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:41,550
frameworks to 25.7 base library so it

00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:45,780
will take a while but luckily if by then

00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:49,890
it will have been I do not enough to

00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:56,010
have a really good quality ready for

00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:59,550
okay f5 and yeah and I now started i

00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:03,870
started to to port okay everything to

00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:07,170
keep quick controls to everything where

00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:08,640
it makes make sense when whaling fleet

00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:11,040
quick controls to there is a kind of

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:14,240
similar class that that's mean our API I

00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:20,100
can really save a lot of criminal code

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:25,410
because it's done quite well and yeah

00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:29,250
you can you can find more information we

00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:33,870
have on the wiki published the human

00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:37,470
interface guidelines how application

00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:42,960
should be done on mobile and on desktop

00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:45,930
and also what are the correspondent

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:51,000
component of kirigami that helped to

00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:55,440
implement a particular concept all the

00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:01,490
API is a is documented on the API that

00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:06,330
KD dot org website if you want to try it

00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:09,230
now very easily there is a the gallery

00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:12,780
application on work like Google Play

00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:16,560
just search for kirigami gallery and

00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:18,480
among the ddddd many things that talk

00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,400
about actual kirigami means there is

00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,520
also that one

00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:28,420
then we are on IRC on multiple channels

00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:31,030
on main list so if you if you have a

00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:34,920
question also in the next days months

00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:37,450
just should there or if you have it now

00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:56,050
please ask an thank you very much

00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:58,300
everybody okay you know um you take this

00:51:56,050 --> 00:52:00,190
stuff in there that your record you can

00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:03,270
abstain also too cute big and tall's to

00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:06,310
like the drawers may give their usual

00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:09,940
something I would like to upstream and

00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:17,790
quick controls to have a drawers and

00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:22,870
that's what we are going to use maybe

00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:26,620
maybe the work on the visible handle

00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:30,510
could be something that could make sense

00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:34,060
in controls to think like the EDD

00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:37,320
derivation global drawer I don't think

00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:41,860
so because it's a it's a really specific

00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:45,250
use case there are there things that I

00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:50,530
would really love to see there like an

00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:53,740
abstract action object again and some

00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:58,330
some small details like that but overall

00:52:53,740 --> 00:53:01,480
I'm quite happy about keep Quinn

00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:04,960
controls to how is this a base for us

00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:07,270
and yeah if whenever I see something

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,330
that should really makes me make more

00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:13,020
sense there yeah it's definitely to be

00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:13,020
try to upstream

00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:27,790
but the choice of saying each must be

00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:30,580
tier 1 is it really something which has

00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:32,080
a lot of impact of all people are going

00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:36,130
to use it because since now the

00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:39,820
framework sorry separated it's not it

00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:45,130
should not be sad much to add if it's

00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:50,260
not varied a jawan care again all right

00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:52,330
answer the questions you want that

00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,840
Jeremy is just here one because yes

00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:58,150
people would not use it as but since no

00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:00,550
it's a frameworks are really separated

00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:02,380
if you would just use one thought he won

00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:08,040
but here because it's interesting would

00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:14,170
it really prevent what you use it we can

00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:17,680
we may see if ppl makes sense to it to

00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:24,450
use other t1 frameworks but what I would

00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:26,890
rather do probably is to make either

00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:32,470
add-ons for kirigami maybe another

00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:35,290
repository so I so I think maybe an

00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:38,190
ounce package that uses a couple of

00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:43,810
frameworks that do something useful or

00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:48,510
adding in the frameworks themselves the

00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:48,510
proper bindings that you just need those

00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,970
and do you think you yourself component

00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:03,290
is complete now where are their

00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:07,260
opponents of your planet or at the port

00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:11,280
what is complete you have the action

00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,750
menus and stuff but is it like other

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:23,570
things that you think we need to add

00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:26,190
this as well as what as a the number of

00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:32,610
graphical objects that we have I think

00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:38,150
it's pretty much complete probably but

00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:41,520
for sure as always happens by the use by

00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:45,360
by the long used by people there there

00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:49,500
will be feedback about about new things

00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:51,780
that could be could be needed but i'm

00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:55,530
i'm pretty happy on on what we have so

00:55:51,780 --> 00:56:00,990
far it will probably need some more

00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:04,440
things desktop specific forum for

00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:06,360
adapting in a better way the

00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:10,320
applications to desktop we already have

00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:15,000
something but that may need a bit more

00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:16,890
search so basically we have think we

00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,720
have everything that absolutely needs to

00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:21,000
be done to be there but there can be

00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,650
more further components that are nice

00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,260
additions and that would make it even

00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:28,560
more valuable even some some things like

00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:31,350
people said that they're missing an easy

00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:34,170
an easy date picker for example that

00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:36,540
there is a calendar element in cookery

00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:38,220
too but there is one something where

00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,410
they can just go into a field and then

00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,640
they they have a nice date and time

00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,640
picker things like that

00:56:53,410 --> 00:57:00,490
I was going to ask about theming and the

00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:05,740
system seems system the second support

00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:07,780
basically phones full sizes background

00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:11,980
colors and so on are supported in the

00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:19,960
program or not moment yeah basically we

00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:25,060
use we use a an approach to doing styles

00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:27,490
that it's similar to how cute quick

00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:30,760
controls to does so we have some binding

00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:34,150
classes that like there is one that is

00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:37,120
called units for for having sizes one

00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:42,420
called team forming colors one called

00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:45,760
icon to render an icon with it that are

00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:51,340
that are loaded depending on the

00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:55,510
platform so for instance the the gallery

00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:58,900
here is a it's using the style form for

00:57:55,510 --> 00:58:02,320
plasma mobile it would look quite

00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:10,770
different if I loaded it let's see if I

00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:10,770
can if I loaded it with the desktop

00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:30,390
style the same thing it looks quite

00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:34,870
different so the yeah defines the colors

00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:37,930
how equals are loaded it it may vary

00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:42,460
from platform to platform at the moment

00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:45,130
we just have a couple desktop plus

00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:47,490
mobile and ended generic fallback one

00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:51,310
that we are using but on Android and iOS

00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:55,450
the testings like just like loading

00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:58,450
icons from a subdirectory having a

00:58:55,450 --> 00:59:00,490
script to extract them so you ship only

00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,290
the breeze icon this did you need and

00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:05,980
you don't ship an Android application

00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:09,040
with two thousand place I constant when

00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:12,670
be good and you can also see here that

00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,770
the what's normally is global draw is

00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,450
here a sign Bob because you have more

00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:19,150
space on the desktop so you can always

00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:21,130
show it and have it only closed manually

00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:23,440
these are some of the things that we do

00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:31,720
for automatic adaptation to different

00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:37,800
form factors the last question any last

00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:37,800
