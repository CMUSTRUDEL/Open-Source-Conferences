good morning everybody this is when

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,010
you're polite and stop talking to your

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,710
seat neighbors good morning everybody my

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,220

this is quite a crowd that has made its

00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,140
way into the room here and it's also you

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,790
are quite a unique audience because I

00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,610
don't think this has been tried many

00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:52,050
times before to bring together five

00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:55,200
different communities or groups to

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:59,620
another same roof for a joint conference

00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:02,710
so we have here the commercial and the

00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:05,770
open-source cute communities we have the

00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:10,270
KD community the FS fe community and the

00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:13,630
video land community and I encourage you

00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,729
all to exchange ideas and knowledge as

00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,860
much as you can because you're probably

00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,150
talking to the people in your own

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,270
community that you talked to all the

00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:26,290
time anyway so use this opportunity to

00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:29,590
learn about new things he'll help others

00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,600
learn about things that you know I would

00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,960
also like to encourage everybody to try

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,380
and bridge the gap between voluntary and

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,069
commercial software development here for

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:45,580
those of you who who are maybe still

00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:48,160
still in college use this opportunity to

00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:51,280
talk to people who are earned the living

00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,319
writing software what that is like for

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,020
those of you who already pay the rent by

00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,450
writing software learn what's going on

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,060
in the universities and obviously if

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:05,160
you're still a student and may be

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:08,110
nearing towards the end or looking for

00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,250
looking for how what your life could

00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:15,010
offer you in terms of employment and

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,410
revenue generating activities in the

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,510
future you will find a multitude of

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,120
companies that possibly could all be

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,220
potential employers for you so use this

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,800
opportunity as well to find out about

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,709
those and what your career could look

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,180
like this is not a job fair but this is

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:35,500
actually better because you will see

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:38,050
many of these companies talk about what

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,910
they do because they send and they sent

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,700
their staff here to to their

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,450
presentations and while I'm admonishing

00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,090
you to do things here are some more

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,150
please turn off the

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,879
the audible notifications on your phones

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,950
I mean if you intend to play with your

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,180
phone phone throughout the presentations

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,310
then why did you need to come all the

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,950
way to Berlin anyway of course if you

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,879
just came three stops by underground by

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:09,810
all means keep playing with your phone

00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:14,590
about the batches so these badges are

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:18,400
slightly buggy it may well happen that

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:20,739
you lose your badge because this easily

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,859
tears off here so what I suggest you do

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,379
is at a suitable time maybe when they're

00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:28,060
not over crowded down there go to the

00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:30,549
registration desk because they have a

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,669
tool that helps you fix the badges and

00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,980
this tool is means integration of

00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:38,139
traditional means of production into the

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,669
modern software development process more

00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:45,549
precisely you will glue to paper

00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:49,359
stickers on to your badge one more thing

00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:52,299
about the badges please wear your badge

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:55,000
at all times while around here security

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:58,150
has been instructed to escort you out if

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,829
you don't wear your badge so do the

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,419
paper sticker thing early on in the

00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:03,819
conference before you lose it and if you

00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:05,859
find somebody else's badge please return

00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,629
it to the front desk and if you lose

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:09,430
your badge please go to the front desk

00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:13,959
and reclaim it there in the hope that

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:17,470
somebody has already returned it then

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:20,470
there is a conference app so go to your

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,699
favorite app store and download the

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,479
conference app to find up-to-date

00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:32,530
information about rooms speakers times

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:36,570
and so on and so on and this is probably

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:39,159
a good time to introduce to you the

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,740
different communities that we've brought

00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:44,800
together here so each of them will give

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,539
you a very short intro into who they are

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,909
so that those of you who are from a

00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:50,800
different community can get a first idea

00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:52,620
of what those other people that you

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,190
haven't seen at your usual conferences

00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:00,590
before and then after that we'll get the

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:03,360

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,830
technology in a little bit of a special

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,690
place here because we are based

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,630
basically both open source and

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,460
commercial you know 20 years ago a bit

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,850
more than 20 years ago it started off

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,919
with a company in Norway creating cute

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,080
as a technology and selling it

00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,140
commercially and since then you know

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,750
we've always opened up more and more

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,850
towards the community we've been trying

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,710
to you know be as open as we can with

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,800
everything we're doing with all the

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,630
technology and it led to nowadays really

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,760
us doing pretty much everything that we

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,460
have out in the open under open-source

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,960
licensing and we still have you know

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,180
that commercial backing which really

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,669
helps us you know push cute forward at a

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,250
very fast pace and get lots of things

00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:53,440
done I've been working with that last

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,080
year we've been had having lots of talks

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,330
with KDE we have a contract with KDE to

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,160
ensure that cute always remains open

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:04,780
we've been doing a big work there to

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,790
renew that contract and now you know

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,770
we've added a lot more content to that

00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,140

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,070
what we've been doing now so you know

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,900

that you will hear more about doing the

00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:31,130

turning 20 years which for free software

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:43,370
project is a remarkable achievement and

this conference yes and this conference

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:48,950
is also our way to celebrate those 20

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:54,650
years and plan for the next 20 years and

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:56,780
more but we've also done something

00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,600
really important for the community in

00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,480
2016 already which is right down our

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,990
vision it has not been an easy process

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,640
but we've come to agree that we strive

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,980
for a world in which everyone has

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,900
control over their digital life and it

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:18,950
shows freedom and privacy this is really

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:21,590
important in today's world and we KDE

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,750
