Title: Keynote Speaker: Leslie Hawthorn - Cultivating Empathy - QtCon Akademy 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: QtCon Akademy 2016
Description: 
	When considering how to design products, teams, or even common every day household objects, empathy doesn't end up on the required features list. Yet, without empathy, teams with enormous technical skills can fail in their quest to deliver quality products to their users. Incredible projects fail to create communities because they don't exercise it. Fail at empathy, and your chances of failing at everything skyrockets. 

Contrary to what you may have heard, empathy is not something you're innately born with - it's a skill that can be learned, cultivated, refined and taught to others. In this presentation, Leslie Hawthorn will discuss the value of empathy, how you can cultivate it in yourself and your organizational culture, and conclude with concrete steps for leveling up in your interactions with your fellow human beings.

what a gracious welcome thank you good

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,940
morning to all of the wonderful humans

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,410
assembled here this morning as Lydia has

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,240
mentioned my name is Leslie Hawthorne

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,250
and I think I've gotten the opportunity

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,100
to know many of you in the audience at

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,960
least virtually through my past life as

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,250
the program manager for google Summer of

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,689
Code I have spent about over a decade

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,460
working in the free and open source

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,769
software world and right now i'm

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,690
currently at Red Hat on their open

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,420
source and standards team where I focus

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,760
on the centos project and its ecosystem

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,050
and contributor community I'm also on

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,059
the board of directors for the Open

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,239
Source Initiative and I generally tend

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,700
to live eat sleep and breathe Foss which

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,809
is fun for me but confuses my family

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,129
because they don't understand what i

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,449
mean when i say my daughter is a fork

00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:57,350
they're pretty convinced that she is not

00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,690
cutlery of any kind and they are correct

00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,570
so I am actually honored to be here this

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,420
morning giving a talk that I once upon a

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,920
time gave with another dear friend of

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,840
mine who actually lives in Berlin Diana

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,659
Gunther how many of you folks are

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,070
Berliners okay I see a few hands in the

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,140
audience how many of you know Diana I

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,369
bet it's the exact same hands okay close

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,049
very close so Diana Gunther is a

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,600
community manager very active in the

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,640
Ruby community here in Berlin and she

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,130
and I were sitting down one day and

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,799
shouting about messages that we thought

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,020
would be very useful to the developer

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,320
community coming from folks who really

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,170
like to deal with squishy human problems

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,170
and maybe deal a bit less with the

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,149
creation of software and we in our

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,070
discussion decided that a very important

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,909
message to take to the community was

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,250
about the importance of empathy and the

00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:56,430
importance of being able to effectively

00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:00,390
understand the emotions and motivations

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,540
of the people that we work with and so

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,810
without further ado let's talk about why

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,910
empathy actually matters and this is the

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,760
part where my slides are going to be

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,530
very unethical and to me and not advance

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,650
because they're just like

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,989
where is the love I can also do this

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,170
talk is interpretive dance so if this if

00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:25,120
we have complete slide fail it's cool

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:29,230
once upon a time I was a slide and I

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,700
advanced I'm actually running out of

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:35,200
jokes so if you could work that'd be

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,110
super cool okay where oh hey look at

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:45,790
that where is the love oh and there was

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:47,739
a thing here no all right so anyway

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,180
someone over here is going to touch my

00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,459
laptop while I perform interpretive

00:02:49,180 --> 00:03:00,609
dance so empathy is actually a search

00:02:51,459 --> 00:03:03,430
for slides excellent wah wah wah so why

00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:06,489
empathy matters so typically when we

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,260
hear about the value of empathy we hear

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,540
about it in terms of a lot of shiny

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,250
happy being friends with people and

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,959
making people feel good about

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,340
interacting with you and that is

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,440
certainly true and that is certainly

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,410
very important and I will be focusing a

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,239
decent amount of this presentation

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:25,299
talking about interpersonal dynamics but

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,620
i think that empathy matters much more

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:28,660
extensively just beyond our

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,700
interpersonal interactions it is a

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,459
driver of success in those interpersonal

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,400
interactions but without successful

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:39,370
interpersonal interactions we are not

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,209
successful human beings in our various

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:47,620
endeavors right so without empathy we

00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:51,340
create projects that are terrible we

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,879
create products that are unusable and we

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,699
create communities where very few people

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,769
want to participate and given the fact

00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,810
that everyone in this room is in some

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,400
way involved in Freight open source

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,769
software I think we all know the

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,720
importance of having a healthy community

00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:09,840
filled with contributors who want to

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,250
stick around and keep contributing

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,709
because we're all in this together and

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,049
if someone feels like their time is not

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,959
well spent with us we're going to lose

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,000
not only that person's time commitment

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,410
but also the unique abilities that they

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,900
bring to the project so the goal of

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,690
a fee is to create harmony in our

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,850
interactions it's not about creating a

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,320
world in which everyone is contented or

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,750
everyone is happy that would be

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,390
wonderful if we could do that but let's

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,910
be realistic we are all human beings we

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,280
all have flaws everyone will not be

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,470
happy all the time but what we want is

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,590
is harmonious interactions the ability

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,870
for there to be effective give-and-take

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,840
for people to be able to understand that

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,870
even if they don't get what they want

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,240
that their needs are being heard and

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,830
that their desire to contribute and what

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,470
they have brought to the table is

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,530
appreciated and respected even if it is

00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,960
not acted upon so rather than thinking

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,880
about empathy in terms of why it's great

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,260
let's talk about what happens when we

00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,300
have empathy fail this is a total

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,700
failure of empathy and failure of design

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,010
and if you are bored later and I hope

00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,440
you are not this board just tripe into

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,720
your favorite search engine bad design

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,240
you will discover that the answer to

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,320
this question is always a bathroom

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,420
universally I don't know why apparently

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,730
architects just have deep hatred for

00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,550
designing toilets so let's take this as

00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:41,820
a wonderful example so let's not even

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,350
get into having the power outlet in a

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,810
really scary position right below the

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,100
soap because as you dispense your soap

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,600
no doubt what you really want to do is

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,180
get your liquid soap into the power

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,310
outlet making sure that no one can use

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,930
the power later and possibly doing some

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,169
serious damage to yourself I'm not quite

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,120
certain or we have our wonderful mirror

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,470
which it's great it's important to be

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,120
able to look at yourself and make sure

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,740
that you're presentable before heading

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,560
out to the world but if you'd like to

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,300
actually wash your hands in the sink you

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,120
can do so by shoving them underneath

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,970
that wonderful shelf there and then

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,010
pulling on the handles in order to

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,169
dispense water which is wonderful

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,180
because therefore you can scrape your

00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:26,040
knuckles every single time you try and

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,540
turn the sink on or off or perhaps after

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,850
you have finished washing your hands

00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,560
you'd like to try them it seems

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,090
reasonable so the best thing we can

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,510
possibly do is put the paper towel

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:39,120
dispenser right next to the sink so that

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,630
each time you extend your paper towel by

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,880
pushing down

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,770
on the handle your paper towel falls on

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,210
the sinking gets wet because that's the

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,040
best way to dry your hands with a wet

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,560
paper towel I can't possibly imagine a

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,070
better way to do it and then finally if

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,990
you need a tissue well the best place to

00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,310
put those is on top of the paper towel

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,380
dispenser so that they can fall directly

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,420
into the sink and get wet because I

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,620
don't know about you but there's nothing

00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,690
like blowing your nose with a wet

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,200
Kleenex I mean that's my favorite right

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:10,830
it's just great this is a complete

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,250
failure of empathy right here right no

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:18,240
one actually thought about how their

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,440
user would make use of this space not to

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,210
mention that it's ugly the paint is

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,800
peeling the furniture is weird and has a

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,510
price tag on it like I don't even want

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,300
to get into that that's just bizarre but

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,160
this is this is what happens when you

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,280
have no empathy when you don't think

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,630
about how other people are feeling how

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,510
they're going to use what you've created

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,250
when you just say okay what is it equal

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,570
to create the space okay I need to sync

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,700
I need a mirror I need some paper towels

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,910
and I need some tissue you end up with

00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,030
something that meets spec and is

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,980
completely useless and in fact creates

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,110
frustration and misery in the user

00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,600
because they end up using a wet Kleenex

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,910
right like it's just not it's just not

00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,180
effective so our goal here today is to

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:04,170
talk about some concrete ways that

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:06,780
individuals and project communities can

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,730
build empathy within themselves and

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,410
within that community so that you don't

00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,680
end up in this this terrible room right

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:15,510
here and I'm serious like just go and

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,950
spend some time on your favorite search

00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,970
engine this is not even the worst one

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,520
it's just the one that didn't have

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:26,220
anything unsavory but it was not keynote

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:27,900
appropriate hello I slides I love you

00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,090
and I understand that you're tired this

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:34,280
morning on a saturday and i went to who

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:36,450
want to advance so empathy is not just

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,539
about the people that we interact with

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,479
right it's also about you one of the

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:45,390
things that i find to be personally very

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,430
frustrating when we are talking about

00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,750
sticky human problems and the free and

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,510
open source software community is

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,310
there's often a lot of focus on how we

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,260
build up effective teams

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,210
and how we have good interpersonal

00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,670
reactions and the reactions of other

00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:02,070
people to us and I think that that's

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,830
very important but I also think that it

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,580
is silly of me to think that I can

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:10,320
persuade an audience to care about

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,430
empathy just by saying you should be

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,500
empathetic because it'll make other

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,270
people happy well that's great and I

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,310
think I would like to think that we all

00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,740
care about making other people happy but

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,440
I care about you being happy and you

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,140
making yourselves happy as well so

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,589
empathy is also about you as an

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,850
individual if you look at a research

00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:32,010
that's been done by various

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,440
organizations that focus on questions of

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,860
human resources allocation such as the

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,029
McKinsey group and looking through the

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,350
Harvard Business Review there's an

00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,420
article about this at least once a week

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,839
detailing various scientific studies

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,420
about the success of people in the

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,930
workplace who are effective at

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,880
empathizing with their peers so people

00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,520
who are very empathetic tend to find

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,930
that they are promoted more quickly they

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,360
tend to find that they are considered to

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,460
be better leaders they get paid a little

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,640
bit more I think that the research that

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:09,330
I was around four percent and they tend

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:13,260
to report greater workplace satisfaction

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,880
so empathy is not just about creating a

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,040
better product creating a better team

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,530
and any of that other raw raw raw stuff

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,780
although I like to raw raw clearly it's

00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:24,240
also about making sure that you as an

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,760
individual are able to benefit so this

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,430
is not just about other people this is

00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:34,950
also about you so first and foremost

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,770
empathy is a choice this may come as a

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:40,440
huge shock to you but it has been shown

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,959
in recent research that empathy is

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,680
actually something that we choose to

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,390
exercise so some scientists performed an

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,950
experiment and I always hate using this

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,410
as an example because it seems kind of

00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,910
reductive and sad but effectively they

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,450
measured whether or not empathy was

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,160
something innate or a choice by telling

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,320
people that they were going to find

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,080
themselves in a situation in which their

00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,040
empathy would be invoked so if you walk

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,680
down this hallway

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,019
you will get to the soda machine if you

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,060
walk down this hallway you will get to

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,910
the soda machine but you will have to

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:19,690
pass the room of someone who is being

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:23,019
treated for health issues and near

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,690
universally people would choose the

00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:27,339
option which meant that their empathy

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,709
would not be invoked right their sense

00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,949
of connection with that other person

00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:34,480
wouldn't be tapped and the scientists

00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:35,560
who were doing the study theorized one

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,839
that they thought that this was

00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,769
surprising they assumed that certain

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,620
people would just be more empathetic

00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:44,199
than others innately as part of their

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:47,259
biochemistry they discovered that that

00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:49,300
was not the case and to they also were

00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:52,660
very surprised because they assumed that

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:57,910
people who self described themselves as

00:11:52,660 --> 00:12:00,610
very caring individuals would not shy

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,160
away from the option which would invoke

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,740
empathy in themselves and what they

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,680
discovered was that people described the

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,779
a fear a fear of having an empathetic

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,079
reaction thinking that it would cost

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:16,060
them something to feel that sense of

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,709
connection right that they were they

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,810
wanted to avoid it because they were

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:22,389
worried that they were going to have to

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,490
give too much of themselves by having

00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:25,990
that sense of connection now

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,720
interestingly enough in a follow-up

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:33,190
study they also discovered that if

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,899
people were encouraged just told that it

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,920
would be helpful for them to be

00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:39,010
empathetic there would be helpful for

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,990
them to say hello to the person and the

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:44,740
hallway number two who is being treated

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:47,199
for disease that they would choose then

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,199
to do so as soon as they understood that

00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:52,329
there was a benefit a reward to their

00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,470
behavior as opposed to just simply

00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:55,839
thinking it was going to cost them

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,939
something to connect they were much more

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,329
willing to connect and they felt the

00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:04,269
benefit of doing so so the reason that I

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,430
think that this is important is fairly

00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:08,949
frequently I've had a conversation about

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,360
empathy with some folks in the in the

00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:12,610
free software world and they've said

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,889
well you know I'm just not really a

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,870
people person and I really just like i'm

00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:18,519
not good at the feelings part of stuff

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,620
and like i'm not really good at social

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,570
cues and

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,420
fair enough right I'm actually secretly

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:28,180
a huge introvert I play an extrovert on

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,410
stage and on TV so I get that feelings

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,450
are hard right and I get the

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,740
interpersonal interactions are really

00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:38,020
difficult but by hiding behind kind of a

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,850
I don't want to call it a veil of

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,530
excuses but it is kind of a veil of

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,530
excuses right of just being able to say

00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:47,860
I am NOT this person who is good at

00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,480
interacting with other people you know

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,520
we cut ourselves off from the

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,630
opportunity to learn and to exercise

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,520
that choice to be empathetic and to be

00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,710
the kind of person who is able to have

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,500
those connections with other people that

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,790
are mutually beneficial so again empathy

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,740
is a choice if you don't think of

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,820
yourself as an empathetic person that's

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,560
okay it's something you can choose to do

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,470
because it's not an innate skill it is

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,350
something that has to be learned and

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:19,870
this is true of all of us right I did

00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:23,140
not wake up one day and suddenly go well

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,570
wow I'm super pathetic now that's great

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,590
everyone's gonna like won't like totally

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,940
want to hang out at Leslie's house

00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,500
because alyssa is that super cool person

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,720
who really understands us know that is

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,020
not how it works you learn this through

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,490
the or repeated exercises of interacting

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,440
with other human beings and some of the

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,850
wonderful tips that we will go through

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:46,570
in this very presentation so easy one to

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:49,780
start off with you start practicing

00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,950
empathy through self-awareness and I

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,710
think that this is one of the reasons

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:56,860
why people can have a great deal of

00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,450
trouble trying to be empathetic like

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,610
it's hard enough having a relationship

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,780
with yourself let alone having

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,990
relationships with other human beings

00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,060
like right I mean I how many of you like

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,080
every you know wake up every morning and

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,190
when you're thinking like hey what do I

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,690
want to do today you can't even figure

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,280
out like do I want the coffee first or

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,800
do I want to like you know read the news

00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,670
first I know I can't I don't know I

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,900
can't really figure out what I want to

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:21,600
do until I have the coffee so I know I

00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:23,980
have to do that first so everyday

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,920
practice this process of self-awareness

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,320
and it can be very simple right just

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:33,089
what has happened to me in the past day

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:36,059
or in the past week that I found real

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:38,129
a useful that I really enjoyed that I

00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:41,910
thought was really good and then ask

00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:44,610
yourself why why was that useful why was

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:47,730
that good why did I enjoy that moment

00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:50,149
and conversely for things that were

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:53,279
terrible like moments that just sucked

00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:55,019
why did this suck you know was it

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,360
because I was frustrated well why was I

00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:01,230
frustrated right practicing the the

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,360
process of the five wise on ourselves as

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,550
individuals and not just on our projects

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,350
and and you know retrospectives or post

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,180
mortems i think is an incredibly

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,639
valuable tool for those of us who work

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,290
in the software industry to begin to

00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,600
have a greater level of self-awareness

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,240
and once we're aware of what's going on

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,939
with ourselves it's that much easier to

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,040
understand what's going on with other

00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,569
people and the great thing that I've

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,490
learned through trying to practice

00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:29,399
greater self-awareness is we're really

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:31,889
not all that different as individuals as

00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:35,730
much as we may think that we r / culture

00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:39,029
x own language pasts presence and future

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:41,519
we're all human beings and fundamentally

00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:43,470
we are very all much alike and I find

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,579
that to be a very promising thing to

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,050
have learned all right so now let's get

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:52,050
out of interacting with just ourselves

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:55,559
and talk about interacting with other

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,050
people so practice active listening if

00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,990
you want to make yourself a more

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:04,230
empathetic person everybody know what

00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,520
active listening is it oh I see so many

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,730
hands this is great I get to tell you

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,770
anything I'm very excited excellent so

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:17,429
active listening actually comes out of

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:19,980
the school of folks who were practicing

00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:22,039
negotiation in the Middle East peace

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:26,669
process and the idea was to put

00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:29,429
individuals who were involved in both

00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:30,809
sides of the of the debate in a room

00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:33,750
together and to get them to talk about

00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:35,580
their feelings about the Middle East

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,049
peace process so putting people from

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,880
Palestine and people from Israel in the

00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:43,590
same room and getting them to talk about

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,549
their concerns and this is just a topic

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,870
that is fraught with peril so i'll just

00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:48,510
say their concerns

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,130
and you know how are they going to

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,270
interact with one another and the idea

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,800
was that rather than becoming upset

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:59,130
rather than bringing one's assumptions

00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,650
to that conversation your overall goal

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,890
as an individual participant was to

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,210
listen and to listen and to show the

00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,090
person that you are speaking to that you

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,740
were listening so active listening

00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:15,360
involves the process of something that

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:20,610
we call mirroring so to use a very basic

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:23,580
example if I come in to the office and I

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:26,370
look grumpy and I clearly my body

00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,559
language is really reserved and I don't

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,429
I'm not really look it up and anybody in

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,370
the eye and I don't really want to talk

00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:34,800
to anybody and somebody is is concerned

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,750
wants to ask me how I'm doing hey hey

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,760
Leslie how are you this morning you look

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,000
like you look like maybe this isn't your

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,970
morning and if I say yeah you know it's

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,520
diet I'm having I hate everything day my

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:50,070
car wouldn't start and you know I've got

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,990
a run in my stocking and you know my

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,730
jewelry doesn't match and you know blah

00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,830
blah blah these are by the way things I

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,750
would never say because you know I don't

00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:01,770
wear stockings and jewelry is not that's

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:04,200
just to advance me but uh you know so

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,870
then if I want to show that I'm actually

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,240
paying attention instead of you know

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,590
checking email on my phone which most of

00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,030
us are want to do these days it's like

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:16,650
oh I understand it sounds like you had a

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,960
really frustrating morning right like

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,370
things didn't go the way you expected

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,559
you were you know you had issues with

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,870
your transportation you didn't have the

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,210
opportunity to kind of present yourself

00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,800
to the world the way that you wanted to

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,740
like I get it that's a bummer you know

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,570
well just so you know I hear you I

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,570
understand that's super frustrating I

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:39,450
want you to have your space but you know

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,130
none of us care if you you know if

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,330
you're having a grumpy morning we still

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,429
appreciate that you're here and like

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,990
I'll let everybody know to maybe you

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:47,550
know come and ask you questions in your

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,500
office after an hour or two what you've

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,530
had some time to kind of get plugged

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,420
back in right active listening is the

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,540
process of mirroring what someone has

00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,930
said to you not repeating verbatim what

00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,000
they said

00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:04,450
but summarizing it in such a way so that

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,770
it is clear that you have listened to

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:10,060
what they said you actually heard the

00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:12,970
words that you engaged with what they

00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,370
said enough to to interpret it right to

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,990
internalize it like not to say oh your

00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,120
car wouldn't start but to say wow that

00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,040
sounds like it was really frustrating

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,930
right because the problem is not the car

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,740
wouldn't start it was clearly everything

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:29,680
that followed thereafter and to also as

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:33,100
part of that to say here is what I would

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,980
like to offer you by way of what has

00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,690
changed in my mind and my thinking from

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,360
having to listen to you right I'll let

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,010
people know to give you a little while

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,960
to get ready this morning now that's a

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:49,420
very silly example but when you practice

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,400
active listening when you actually take

00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,190
the time to listen to other people and

00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,350
not just listen but show them that you

00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,620
have listened by practicing that

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:02,050
mirroring you'll find that people

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:05,020
respond to you much much better in

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:09,040
conversation has anyone seen the movie

00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:12,670
or read the book Fight Club I see a

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,720
couple of hands okay so for those of you

00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,010
who have not I don't know if I

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,570
necessarily recommend it there's some

00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:19,360
there's some unsavory bits in there but

00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:23,050
I I loved it because there is one scene

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,890
that has stuck with me forever and this

00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:28,150
movie is I think 15 years old so the two

00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,230
of the main characters are having a

00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:34,900
conversation and they're talking about

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:37,210
why they drop in on support groups for

00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,950
terminally ill people when neither one

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,880
of them is ill so like I said if you

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,990
haven't seen this movie I don't

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,570
necessarily know if I recommend it's a

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:46,750
little weird but they're having a chat

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:51,360
and so character one says why do you do

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:55,450
this and character to says I don't know

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,820
it seems like when you're dying people

00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,770
really listen to you instead of and she

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,970
interrupts him and says instead of just

00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:04,790
waiting for their turn to talk

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:07,310
we live in a world where we're all just

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:10,460
waiting for our turn to talk right we

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:12,410
weak form ideas quickly we're ready to

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,460
share them we think it's really really

00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,110
great that we have something to bring to

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,280
the table by sharing our ideas and our

00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,880
knowledge and our thoughts and that's

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:22,040
not a bad thing but if we spend all of

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,160
our time just waiting for our turn to

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,810
talk we've never actually internalized

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,820
anything that's been said to us we've

00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:32,810
never given ourselves the opportunity to

00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:34,250
learn and grow and be changed by what

00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,900
someone else has brought to us and I

00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,430
just think that that's that's it's not a

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,900
it's not a cool way to live right like

00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,220
we're not growing as individuals we're

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:43,100
just bringing to the table what we

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,680
already knew and then listening to

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,480
ourselves talk right and frankly I don't

00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,090
think I'm not interesting so I want to

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,360
hear what you all have to say all right

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:55,730
step two to cultivate empathy this one

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,780
is is one of my favorites because I love

00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:02,240
to read so it has been determined that

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:06,200
people who are active readers of fiction

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,840
are more empathetic which is great so if

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,310
you ever wanted an excuse to blow off

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,630
whatever it was that you were working on

00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,460
because it was frustrating you and just

00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,760
read a good book that's great science

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:20,860
says that you should do it all right

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:25,970
Thank You science so by reading fiction

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:27,950
by creating in our minds the world that

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,360
we're reading about right and and and

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,670
filling in the details that the author

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,790
has not provided in the world that they

00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:36,710
have created we are stimulating the

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:39,680
centers in our brain that are

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,440
responsible for the practice of empathy

00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:46,040
right we are actually having an

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,110
empathetic response to the characters in

00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,960
the story that we're reading because we

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,710
are understanding a set of details that

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,300
we've been given and we are filling out

00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:00,140
the rest of the scene with our own

00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,810
understanding of how characters interact

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:06,290
their emotions their motivations their

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,670
desires so if you are trying to think of

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,980
ways to help yourself become a more

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,800
empathetic person go read a good book

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,759
it'll be an excellent use of your time

00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,589
and I have

00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:18,539
many great works of fiction that I would

00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:20,039
love to recommend to you if you are not

00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:21,659
a fiction reader but I suspect that that

00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,009
may not be a problem with this

00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,190
particular audience maybe our problems

00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:30,809
we breed too much sci-fi yeah yeah yeah

00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:32,459
um I have some squishy human non sci-fi

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:33,929
novels that I can recommend that i did

00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:36,179
not enjoy but we should probably learn

00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:39,409
from because I just wondering the

00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:42,899
science fiction too alright other ways

00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:47,159
to cultivate empathy avoid assumptions

00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:50,789
and be curious ask questions one of the

00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:53,190
fastest ways that we shut down empathy

00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:55,499
and our ability to interact effectively

00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,839
with other people is we assume that we

00:24:55,499 --> 00:25:03,269
know what the other person is thinking

00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:04,799
and feeling and we don't ask so somebody

00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:09,690
doesn't say hello to us in the morning

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:11,279
in the hallway and we think wow Leslie's

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:14,609
mad at me she didn't even say hi this

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,809
morning like why oh man i bet it was i

00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,949
bet it was that I didn't finish that

00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:19,109
project that I was supposed to finish

00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:21,569
for her last week like oh man like I

00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:23,579
wonder she's told she's told the boss

00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:25,649
that I didn't do that thing like oh

00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,449
she's really a jerk anyway like you know

00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,859
she's walks in here and she's super

00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:30,659
grumpy until she finishes drinking her

00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,979
coffee and you know i shouldn't have to

00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,839
put up with that and you know i'm just

00:25:31,979 --> 00:25:35,579
gonna go sit in my cubicle and be peeved

00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,759
for the next 20 minutes because you know

00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:41,669
wow I just got treated really badly in

00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:42,749
the meantime our fictional Leslie is

00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:44,039
upset because her car wouldn't start

00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,489
this morning and had absolutely nothing

00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:48,659
to do with me and I have not actually

00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:50,249
peeved her at all by not finishing our

00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,659
project it would never have crossed her

00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,249
mind to talk to the boss and complain

00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,539
about me and now suddenly instead of

00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:57,029
having one person who had a bad morning

00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:59,459
we have two people who are having a bad

00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:02,279
morning and all because of assumptions

00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:06,539
right it is much better to actually ask

00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:09,419
people what they want what they need and

00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:13,829
what they are thinking even if you think

00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:15,989
you already know the answer okay and

00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:19,319
this there's a couple reasons for this

00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:22,469
one you probably don't honestly know the

00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:24,569
answer to if you do know the answer you

00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:25,769
know a little bit of it right you know

00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:28,050
that somebody you may know that someone

00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:30,110
is upset but you may not know why

00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:32,520
right so making that assumption

00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,860
eliminates your ability to connect with

00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,350
that person to actually you know have

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:41,960
that moment of exchange of ideas of

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:43,860
exchange of goodwill and you're also

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,630
you're cutting yourself off from the

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,830
ability to be surprised right when

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,330
someone tells you what they're actually

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,720
thinking what they're actually feeling

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:53,970
and you had no idea that this was

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,950
important to them that this was a need

00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,200
that they have that this is a need you

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:01,550
could meet a way you can contribute to

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,650
their life if you don't ask questions if

00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:06,210
you don't have curiosity about what's

00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,350
going on with other people around you

00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,840
and you just kind of go through with

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:12,960
your script it's not going to be

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,240
effective and some people may not be

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,120
receptive to that curiosity right like

00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,770
that's okay some people are very private

00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,750
they don't want to share and that's all

00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:24,150
right you know but there are ways to ask

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,350
questions like that like hey you know

00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,270
maybe you don't want to talk about this

00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,130
but you know it looks like maybe this is

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,350
not your morning if you want to talk

00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,030
about it I'm here someone may open up to

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,910
you someone may choose not to but

00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:38,580
putting yourself in that position to be

00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,840
curious and to ask questions is much

00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,370
more effective than just going like well

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,670
yep I already know what's going on if

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:46,830
you already know what's going on there's

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:49,620
no point in having a dialogue and our

00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:54,540
goal here is to create a useful candid

00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:58,760
dialogue with our peers ah this is a way

00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:01,980
that projects can help to create empathy

00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:05,730
be really explicit and inclusive about

00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:08,490
your values so this conference has an

00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:10,230
attendee code that's great wonderful

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,000
congratulations there's been quite a

00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,760
debate about whether or not a project

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,740
code of conduct or conference codes of

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,800
conduct are important and I think that

00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,570
they are very important for reasons that

00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:25,290
sometimes don't get articulated and

00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:28,560
that's that I feel like our discussion

00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:31,500
of who we are as communities projects

00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,660
teams groups usually focuses on what

00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,790
we're trying to build and that's not a

00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:39,030
bad thing we need to tell people why

00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,740
we're here right we are here to build a

00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,570
compelling replacement to CVS so for the

00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,150
subversion project

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:46,280
for example that's great but we need to

00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,100
tell people why we are motivated to

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,710
working together and what is that what

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,450
are the ties that bind us beyond just

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,360
the work that we're trying to do if we

00:28:53,450 --> 00:29:00,410
are not explicit about what we value and

00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:02,570
who we are then we're not giving people

00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:05,390
the opportunity again to really

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:08,690
understand why they belong there and why

00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:11,570
it matters to the group the community of

00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,460
the project that they're there and we

00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,070
all again this goes back to avoiding

00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:19,040
assumptions we may all think that

00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:21,410
everyone understands what the raison

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,210
d'etre of our of our work is together

00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,690
right otherwise why would they show up

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:29,690
but the people who have arrived don't

00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:30,980
necessarily all agree not that they all

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,620
need to agree but there needs to be some

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,110
common ground and think about all the

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,030
people who don't see themselves in the

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,470
work that you're doing who would be

00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,180
wonderful contributors to your project

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,790
if only someone had said to them we

00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,320
welcome we welcome people who are tall

00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,630
we welcome people who are short we

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,940
welcome people who are whatever you know

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:53,600
add in whatever is important and

00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:55,550
valuable to your community one of the

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,140
companies actually that I think does a

00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,900
really great job with this and I loved I

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,220
loved giving them a shout out is a

00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,620
company called ThoughtWorks a folk sort

00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,460
of thought works a couple I see a couple

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:09,170
of nods so thought works is a software

00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,420
services and consulting company and they

00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,070
do a wide variety of projects but I

00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:15,110
really really dig on thought works

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:18,110
because if you go to their company

00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:20,510
website so this is their comm this is

00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,640
not like charitable anything this is

00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,860
just who they are and they talk about

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,550
their values as a company they have an

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:30,920
entire page on social justice and they

00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:33,470
talk about the importance of social

00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:36,080
justice to their company in terms of

00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:39,050
making sure that technology is

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,650
accessible to folks who need to make use

00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:44,840
of it regardless of their ability to to

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,700
pay right so technology should be

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,430
accessible and useful to everyone who

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:52,820
needs it and not only available to a

00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:54,560
privileged few and I really appreciate

00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,220
that because one it helps them get

00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,789
better hire

00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:01,309
they're CEOs explicitly said that but it

00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:02,690
also you know if you're a customer and

00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:04,400
you're trying to decide where you're

00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,780
going to spend your time and money there

00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,669
are any number of companies who will

00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,230
build software for you and who will

00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:11,600
provide consulting services around it

00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,490
right there there are tons of them but I

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,250
would like to spend my time and energy

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:19,159
with a group of people who explicitly

00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,140
say that one of their values as an

00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:22,280
organization one of their goals and one

00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,950
of the things that they will put money

00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,799
behind even though it doesn't contribute

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,960
to their profit margin is ensuring that

00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:32,390
technology is available to all who need

00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,360
it I think that that is incredible and

00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:39,470
by actually making it explicit people in

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,630
the company use that as a marker

00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:45,020
something they can refer back to if we

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,070
are making if we're in a group if people

00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,480
are debating whether or not they should

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,380
work on a particular project of the

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,900
question as well this doesn't

00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:53,870
necessarily contribute directly to

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:56,120
revenue this new idea should we still

00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,950
propose it people can point back to the

00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,280
company values and say well our company

00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:03,110
values state that social justice and

00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,030
making this technology available is

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,409
important to us so yes we should go

00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,610
ahead and proposed this idea even if

00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:10,159
it's not necessarily something that's

00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,049
profit driven right now and by being

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,630
explicit about those values you give

00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:17,020
again people the opportunity to connect

00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:20,270
it's not just all what we think is

00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,860
important right it's what we know is

00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,450
important because we've taken the time

00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,870
to communicate it and be explicit about

00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:28,250
it and tell people what we think and to

00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:32,120
give them that opportunity to connect

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:34,010
into our group all right discourage

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,090
hippo eng this is not just because i

00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,070
wanted to show you a cool picture of

00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:39,799
hippos although i really like hippos

00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:42,020
they're cut they're super cool so

00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:44,630
anybody ever heard the acronym hippo

00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:48,140
it's not just a very large water and a

00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:50,510
blue okay so hipping highest-paid

00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,240
person's opinion is the only one that

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,260
matters and if we're thinking about this

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,730
in terms of free and open source

00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,900
software projects we could think of this

00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:02,990
as highest prestige person's opinion is

00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:06,230
the only one that matters so the idea

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:09,110
that the only the the fanciest among us

00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:12,290
as measured in salary or as measured in

00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:15,950
prestige are the only people who have

00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:20,390
something valuable to say is a damaging

00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:22,970
idea right no single one of us knows

00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,080
everything I don't and I don't like this

00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,420
is not something that I should have to

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,610
you know really hammer home because if

00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,990
any of us were perfect like there would

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,820
be software projects with no bugs

00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,809
because our you know benevolent

00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,920
dictators for life would have never

00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:36,530
introduced any of them into the code

00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:40,580
base ever oh man this is not actually

00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:42,500
happening right so if you are in an

00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,330
organization I think it is important to

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:48,620
make an explicit value that everyone's

00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:52,370
ideas are worth contributing now you may

00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,750
hate your community about the steps that

00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,330
you would like them to take to vet their

00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,880
idea so that you're not spending every

00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,650
meeting say rehashing the same proposed

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,530
technical solution to a problem that

00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:06,169
came up ten years ago and it didn't work

00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:07,760
then it won't work now that's okay it is

00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,970
okay to ask folks to do some background

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,490
homework but telling people that you

00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:15,290
explicitly value their contribution even

00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:17,929
if they are junior even if they are new

00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,429
even if they don't have the greatest

00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:22,040
amount of domain expertise in a

00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:23,570
particular area provided they're willing

00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,280
to be respectful about how they share

00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,580
their opinion is incredibly important

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,800
because again the plethora of

00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:33,530
perspectives helps us to create better

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,010
things if we're just making stuff for

00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:39,080
people who think like us that's not very

00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,669
helpful the only people who are going to

00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,730
use what we've created our people who

00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:46,310
think exactly like we do and I would

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,629
hope I sensibly we're all hoping that

00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:50,960
we're creating something that is more

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:53,169
universally useful so making it explicit

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,060
that you want everyone's opinion and

00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:57,500
that you value all people who have

00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,200
something useful and effective to

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:03,290
contribute is important now what to do

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,030
if you are the hippo if you're the

00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,650
highest paid person in the room or the

00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:12,109
highest prestige person in the room

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:13,390
right so first of all be aware that this

00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:15,880
is

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:18,160
that this is a thing that people will

00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,960
buy the nature of the way that we have

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,819
been taught and socialized think that

00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:27,069
they are only severus they're supposed

00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:29,920
to defer to you it is amazing to me the

00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:32,380
number of project meant a nurs company

00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,589
founders right and executives who have

00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,029
said oh it doesn't no no no no no

00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:40,089
everybody thought that this thing was a

00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:41,260
good idea ever ever no everyone agreed

00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:43,569
with me everyone thought it was a great

00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,400
idea that we don't do agile right like

00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:48,549
everyone thought agile was a horrible

00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,230
idea it's like well yeah when the

00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:51,730
company founder stands up and says like

00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,140
if we do agile I'm going to quit and

00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,250
like I don't want to talk about this

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,109
anymore and everyone goes to out shows

00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,029
of course yes of course because your

00:35:56,109 --> 00:36:00,190
status as a founder had nothing to do

00:35:58,029 --> 00:36:01,779
with that right everybody was talking

00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,980
about it for ten minutes really excited

00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:04,599
up until the part where you were like no

00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,549
and then suddenly everyone like oh no

00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:07,750
yes no we've all let me automatically

00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:10,420
changed our minds yes we suddenly

00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:12,309
realized we were wrong before this be

00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,400
aware of your status be aware of the

00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:16,569
power that you carry even in groups

00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,509
where we tend to think of ourselves is

00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:21,640
very non hierarchical that's not the way

00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:23,650
that human beings have been taught to

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,819
interact with one another right so we

00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:30,309
have to go through this kind of process

00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:32,140
of unlearning or engaging with standard

00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:33,789
social dynamics so so be aware of the

00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,259
power that you carry if you are one of

00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:37,990
these people in more of a high prestige

00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:39,819
position right either you know through

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,920
like an actual like hierarchy like you

00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:43,420
are a manager and a company or depending

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,900
upon your social status within a project

00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:51,069
and if you want people to tell you what

00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:52,900
they really think ask them don't tell

00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:54,759
people what you think don't tell people

00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,849
what your idea is at first right ask

00:36:54,759 --> 00:37:00,390
other people what they think you will

00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:02,920
never actually know what people are

00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,809
really wanting to see happen if all you

00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,829
do is tell them what you think because

00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:09,640
that's where they think the conversation

00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:11,319
stops oh I'll stay in your fancy-pants

00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,289
wants this well that's what we're going

00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:17,230
to do that's that's terrible right this

00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:18,519
leads to two just terrible situations

00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,069
where you end up shipping products that

00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:22,779
nobody wants and customers don't want

00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:25,119
and people find stuff unusable because

00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:26,560
everyone simply nodded along with their

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,880
wonderful hippo

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,080
and nobody actually realized that what

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,720
they were doing was a terrible idea that

00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,360
was going to lead them off a cliff so

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,940
again be inclusive and asking for

00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,260
feedback and opinions now I think that

00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,450
there are probably some folks in the

00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,260
audience who are thinking what if

00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:45,790
someone is just a total silly person and

00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,770
says terribly silly things all the time

00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,940
do we still have to listen to them how

00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,510
many of you are thinking that it's okay

00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:54,550
you can admit it okay cool thank you for

00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,530
your honesty sir I see a couple hands

00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,880
that is a completely fair thing to think

00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,930
I am NOT going to stand up here and tell

00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,460
you that everything is always sunshine

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,770
and roses because it's not I'm not going

00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,720
to lie to you sometimes there are silly

00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,810
people and if you encourage them to

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,600
share what they think they will do it

00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:13,090
and it will be silly it is true that is

00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:15,160
true this is a true thing in situations

00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,210
like that applying one of your your

00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,130
friends who is good at dealing with

00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,920
squishy human problems and ask them to

00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:23,980
ask this individual to do a little bit

00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,250
more research before they start sharing

00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,420
their knowledge and enthusiasm a lot of

00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,820
the time people just don't understand

00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,740
how they're being perceived right or

00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,740
that you know it is it is they may not

00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:37,210
actually realize because in it human

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,350
beings are flawed and we have all have

00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,760
to learn things that suggesting

00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,750
something that came up ten years ago as

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,870
a solution to the problem now is

00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:45,040
actually rude so again have a

00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,090
conversation with those folks I'm not

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,730
suggesting this is always going to be

00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,920
sunshine and roses but in general this

00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:56,020
is useful advice when dealing with silly

00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:58,780
people repent reflect rewrote and on

00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,090
silly people don't flip the bozo a bit

00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:04,060
does anybody has anyone heard the term

00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:06,160
flipping the bozo a bit before ok this

00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,960
is bozo the clown which totally makes

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,910
sense where I'm from in America it may

00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,920
not make sense here all right so

00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:15,100
flipping the bozo bit is a phrase from

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,900
oh shoot of course I have forgotten the

00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,980
book title fortunately it is in my

00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,900
speaker notes what you can look it later

00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,370
so in 1995 a gentleman wrote a book

00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,920
called the name to call principles of

00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,780
software design and he talked about the

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,260
idea of flipping the bozo a bit so

00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:31,510
having a very binary reaction to

00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:35,710
individuals either you were smart or

00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:38,730
you're a bozo you're an idiot and so

00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:41,380
once you flip the bozo bit on someone

00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,960
nothing that they ever say or do is

00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,940
going to matter and you are never going

00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:50,640
to listen to them again because they are

00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:55,030
a bozo so the idea is you get one chance

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:58,120
you get one screw up after your one

00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,250
mistake I don't care what you have to

00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,290
say ever again you were the person who

00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,840
is an idiot that time back in you know

00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:07,300
2003 and you will never do anything good

00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,610
or useful again okay so this is an

00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:12,790
extrude this is a toxic attitude right

00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:14,560
this is this is terrible for for a lot

00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:17,470
of reasons like one the idea that we

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,170
only get one mistake is awful right and

00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:22,570
this this is this is pretty this is

00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,070
actually a pretty widespread at least

00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,410
for my experience in the business world

00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,450
that people get the opportunity you get

00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:31,990
one mistake and then after that no one

00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:36,490
trusts you again and so how many of you

00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:39,520
never made a mistake oh I see some Liars

00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:40,990
in this audience woke a so there are

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,640
three perfect people in this audience

00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,810
make sure you bug them at the brakes and

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,450
find out how they did it cuz i want to

00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:50,080
know let me know so all of us make

00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:53,070
mistakes huh denial oh I love it okay

00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,950
it's not just a river in Egypt woohoo um

00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:59,470
so again if this is terrible because all

00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,120
of us make mistakes right just plain and

00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,350
simple sometimes we make terrible

00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,340
mistakes sometimes we make small

00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:08,410
mistakes the other reason why this is

00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:11,200
terrible is let's assume you're dealing

00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:14,680
with a for mentioned silly person right

00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,050
if you are blowing off silly person

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,700
because they're silly okay you know fair

00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:21,730
enough the message that you're sending

00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:26,800
to everyone else involved in this

00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:30,160
dynamic in this group process is it's

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:33,310
not okay to be imperfect if you propose

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,310
an idea it it better be perfect if you

00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:41,260
have aspirations or a plan it better be

00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:46,450
perfect because the consequence of a

00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:49,750
mistake is clear implicit or even

00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:51,610
explicit social ostracism within the

00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,140
group right like we will just never take

00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:56,230
you seriously again if you do something

00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,549
wrong okay if that's the message that's

00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,319
being sent to me is another group

00:41:57,549 --> 00:42:02,289
participant where is my motivation to do

00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:05,109
anything that is not status quo it's

00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:07,839
zero it's zero because I have learned

00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:11,819
that to make a mistake means that I will

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:15,130
be judged people won't take me seriously

00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:16,210
people will you know people will I will

00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,849
be the person that people are making

00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,890
jokes about around the coffee machine

00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:23,890
and see what say I'm did this morning

00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:26,559
yeah guys is silly person no one wants

00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,359
to be that person you're you're cutting

00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,289
people off from motivation from doing

00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,910
something new from doing something

00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:35,559
creative and generative because they're

00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:37,809
afraid and also fundamentally there may

00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:40,599
be a person your organization upon whom

00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:42,960
the bozo bit has been flipped and and

00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,960
fair enough they shouldn't be there

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:50,859
that's okay it is okay to ask people to

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,660
leave if they are in the wrong place and

00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:55,119
this is hard because as human beings we

00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:58,089
don't like confrontation right and we

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,529
don't like messy human interactions but

00:42:58,089 --> 00:43:01,839
it is so much better to say to someone

00:42:59,529 --> 00:43:05,289
you know what I think your talents and

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,930
skills are better used elsewhere in this

00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:11,680
thing that you're really good at then

00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:13,660
here because having leaving someone in a

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,059
situation where you you continue to

00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:18,099
overtly say that you accept them but

00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:21,940
your behavior your bozo bit has flipped

00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:23,859
your behavior shows them that they are

00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,660
not accepted that they are not valued

00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:28,470
that they that their opinions are not

00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:31,390
useful even when they say something good

00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:33,039
it's debilitating its demoralizing and

00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:35,259
that kind of attitude just screws up

00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,240
teams like seriously if there is someone

00:43:35,259 --> 00:43:39,970
who is in the wrong place please help

00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,349
them to find the right place and also if

00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,660
you're thinking that there is someone

00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:45,430
who is in the wrong place who doesn't

00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,170
belong with your group or your team or

00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:50,349
your effort because they are clearly a

00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:54,970
bozo before you ask them to go ask

00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:56,589
yourself if that is really true and in

00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,000
some cases you'll find that that was

00:43:56,589 --> 00:43:58,839
completely true and in some cases you'll

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,849
find that you're just being very

00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:02,170
judgmental and maybe you should give

00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:04,359
this person or another chance and that's

00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:06,230
really hard right i think more often

00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:09,290
than not we flip the bozo a bit

00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:10,760
because it is easier to be binary with

00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,619
people right either I trust you I don't

00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,190
I think you're great or I don't right

00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:17,810
there's it's very hard to say wow if

00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,460
eighty percent of the time you're

00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,869
awesome and the other twenty percent of

00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,390
the time I don't want to spend any time

00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:24,650
with you that's hard how do you know

00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:27,160
which one you're in in any given day

00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:29,869
right so we instead we're very binary

00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:33,470
trouble is it's just not effective and

00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:36,650
it leads to homogeneous group think and

00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:38,780
fear of failure and fear of doing

00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:44,060
anything new which leads to stagnation

00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:46,400
and sadness aha make it ok to fail in

00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:49,700
your projects right make it actually ok

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,290
how many of you work at companies where

00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:53,980
they tell you that they encourage

00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:57,920
innovation and it's ok to make mistakes

00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:59,210
that's totally cool excellent of the

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,810
people who have their hands raised

00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:05,090
please put your hand down if that

00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:10,250
mistake didn't impact your salary bonus

00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:11,780
or promotion potential ok only one human

00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,180
being works in a company where it is

00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,710
truly to human beings we're gonna

00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:20,270
company where it is truly ok to fail

00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:23,420
right you need to make it ok to fail and

00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:25,700
this is not just about companies it's

00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,410
also about projects you're going to make

00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,020
decisions about what to do and it's

00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:32,600
going to suck you're going to make huge

00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,700
mistakes so there are any number of ways

00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:38,720
to celebrate failure and make it ok to

00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:41,240
fail right part of this is explicitly

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,380
verbally acknowledging like wow that was

00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,930
a huge screw-up we could have done that

00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:47,510
better what did we learn through this

00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:50,359
failure right so not just focusing on on

00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:52,790
shaming or blaming or sitting around

00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:55,490
stewing in our own feelings of you know

00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:57,290
wow that wasn't cool and I think this is

00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,730
really hard for nerds because we're

00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:01,730
really really smart and so we're not

00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:04,070
used to being wrong right so when we're

00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:05,720
wrong we're like oh let's just hide that

00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,040
over here under the carpet maybe no one

00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,470
else will notice we've moved really fast

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,630
no one will see the mistake just own it

00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:13,940
it's ok talk about it talk about it

00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:17,660
explicitly does anybody heard of the

00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,530
fail cake I see no hands okay this is

00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,069
great I get to talk about something else

00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:22,650
even better because then you get a alt

00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:26,849
to all eat cake all right so there's a a

00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:28,979
process that some groups have instituted

00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:32,900
be they projects be they teams at a

00:46:28,979 --> 00:46:36,479
company where if there is a catastrophic

00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,999
screw up and they will happen it's just

00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:41,430
accepted that they will happen so when

00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:43,349
you go in for your retrospective AKA

00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:45,449
postmortem i hate calling the

00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:46,949
post-mortems because no one died so when

00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:51,930
you go in for your review or your

00:46:46,949 --> 00:46:53,789
after-action report the person who is

00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,640
most directly responsible for this

00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:58,049
catastrophic failure because again the

00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,789
whole team is responsible when there's

00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,859
catastrophic failure but the person who

00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:04,949
is most directly responsible makes cake

00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:08,239
or by his cake and brings cake in to the

00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:10,410
meeting so everybody gets together and

00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:13,380
they all get to sit there and eat a

00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:15,559
slice of cake so you start off with the

00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,059
breaking of bread which is a very

00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:20,309
important process among human beings

00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,440
right we have been sitting down together

00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:24,599
at tables at eating for so long that

00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,489
it's just part of our human experience

00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:28,890
that when you get together and you you

00:47:26,489 --> 00:47:30,539
consume food with other human beings

00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:33,630
that you're coming together as a team

00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,979
right like there's somethin among those

00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,119
people so that's wonderful you're kind

00:47:34,979 --> 00:47:38,940
of just like a Vokoun the human

00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,369
experience and you're eating cake which

00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:43,109
is awesome and delicious and sugary and

00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:44,549
for any diabetics in the audience I

00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:46,019
apologize it's probably not super

00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:49,890
inclusive but you can get sugar-free

00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:51,479
tasty things so you get together you eat

00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:53,069
cake and after you have a couple of

00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:56,910
bites of cake then you start talking

00:47:53,069 --> 00:48:00,299
about what went wrong because it's

00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:02,999
really hard to be a big jerk to each

00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:04,559
other when you're eating cake it is it's

00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:07,309
just it's just not something that you're

00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:10,289
that you're going to find easy to do

00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:15,509
you're giving people also the

00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:17,309
opportunity to demonstrate to

00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:18,930
demonstrate that they are sorry for what

00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:21,989
they have done in a way that doesn't

00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:25,170
shame them right I have made a mistake

00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:29,579
it has caused difficulty for all of you

00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:32,520
I am bringing you a gift that shows that

00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:33,960
I am sorry but I don't have to sit

00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,940
here and grovel before you and tell you

00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,260
how terrible I am how awful it was that

00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,560
I made this mistake instead we are

00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:42,120
sharing a collective gift in a way

00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,250
that's really non-confrontational right

00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:47,610
human beings don't like confrontation

00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,920
and because this is an act this is a

00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:52,740
rich it's a ceremonial ritual right like

00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,740
this happens every single time there's a

00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:58,770
big problem right you're making it okay

00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:01,350
to fail because it is built into your

00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:03,120
culture that this is the ritual of

00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:05,820
failing and if there is a ritual of

00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,620
failure if there is a path for

00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:10,740
understanding and coping with failure

00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:12,150
especially one that's fun people know

00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,290
it's okay to fail if it wasn't ok to

00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:16,200
fail you wouldn't have a ritual for

00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:18,030
failure failure would be ignored failure

00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,080
wouldn't be talked about failure

00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,810
wouldn't be something that anyone

00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:25,740
engaged with right it simply would not

00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:28,110
exist and if you are one of those

00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:30,330
manager types I have been one of those

00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:33,420
manager types before can you tell your

00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:34,920
employees it's okay to fail maybe that

00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,260
should be reflected in their performance

00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,810
reviews just saying how many manager

00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,610
times do we have in the audience a

00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:43,140
couple of manager types okay this this

00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,520
is for all of us right like if we're

00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,770
going to tell our teams that it's okay

00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,330
to make mistakes that should be

00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:50,550
reflected when we you know give them

00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:52,020
feedback later not just like wow were

00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:54,500
you a total screwup it's like oh so we

00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:57,510
learned a lot from that moment in time

00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,680
all right my friends that is all the

00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,510
guidance that I have to give you this is

00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,490
? guy I love him because he looks really

00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:04,680
afraid and also because he's a little

00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:07,050
finger with stickers I'm here and happy

00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,570
to take questions about empathy or any

00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,890
other topic and I want to thank all of

00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:13,790
you for having me here this morning it

00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,790
has been wonderful thanks

00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:29,010
porth iago and lydia got drafted into

00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:30,869
carrying Mike's around so if you want to

00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:32,640
be gentle and not make them walk you

00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:34,260
know backwards and high heels I don't

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,869
know yeah I'll go forgot his heels I

00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:41,460
guess yes nice man who is in denial hi

00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:43,380
we're a team of six people in four

00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,460
different locations uh-huh so it makes

00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,770
it a little bit difficult especially

00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:49,230
nonverbal communication and probably the

00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:50,880
fail cake as well so you can all eat

00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:54,080
together over the internet we don't you

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,310
mean yes webcams yeah so the question is

00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,050
likely have any specific tips for like

00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,610
distributed teams I mean the open source

00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:01,650
community is all over the world as well

00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:03,480
right yes totally so tips tips for

00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,650
empathy for distributed teams okay so

00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,590
the stuff that you can do as an

00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:08,850
individual is really helpful because

00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,990
each team is made up of individuals so

00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:11,460
like the practicing self awareness

00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:14,250
active listening all those things are

00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:17,550
very helpful even in areas where there

00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:19,200
is no nonverbal communication and in

00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,369
fact sometimes especially in places

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,780
where there is no nonverbal

00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,550
communication active listening and that

00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,590
process of mirroring is really helpful

00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,940
because you're showing people that

00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:29,940
you've gotten the whole message even the

00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:31,590
stuff that you can't see the other thing

00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,619
that I would suggest is this is just

00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:36,720
this is such a lawyerly silly answer but

00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:38,400
it's the truth which is you got to get

00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,140
together in person even if you're just

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,030
refuted team right this is why you're

00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,980
all here at this awesome conference

00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:46,350
right like you're all working on various

00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:49,230
projects all over the world and yet

00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:51,240
you're all here together today so giving

00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:52,859
giving people the opportunity to create

00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,830
those social ties in person because we

00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:57,359
are so driven by those in person social

00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,980
connections that allows people to have

00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,510
more effective interpersonal

00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,760
interactions when they are far away from

00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:05,880
each other and last but not least I

00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:09,540
think video conferencing is is a tough

00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,040
one a lot of people talk about having

00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,300
more effective communication because of

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,430
videoconferencing because you're getting

00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,290
more visual feedback with your

00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:19,710
interactions with other people via video

00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:21,720
I really stumble with videoconferencing

00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:22,800
because I spend most of my time being

00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:25,109
distracted by the fact that I think I

00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:29,220
have something in my teeth or just that

00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:31,350
I look funny so I guess yayyyy video

00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,760
conferencing please acknowledge the

00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,990
introverts on your team who hate being

00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,660
on video and don't make fun of them for

00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:39,030
turning the video off when they need to

00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,470
that was my nice lawyerly answer I hope

00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:43,710
it helped yeah I got a thumbs up okay

00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:44,819
thank you other nice humans I also want

00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:46,319
to make it clear that if you have other

00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:47,490
questions I will be around for a bit and

00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:50,930
I don't want to stand in between you and

00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:53,130
coffee because I know it is important I

00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:56,789
myself have only had four cups this

00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:59,819
morning can you tell yes you can that is

00:52:56,789 --> 00:53:02,700
a stretch not a question that is a

00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:05,309
question I think no that is a scratch my

00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:11,789
nose that is totally not a question all

00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:14,069
right cough the old question yay see I'm

00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:16,200
spoiled I have coffee up here it

00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:18,900
occurred to me with your fail cake that

00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:21,750
it's a thing I've one of my past jobs

00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,520
decade knife ago we we actually if you

00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,990
broke the build you went bought

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,799
doughnuts for everybody it was kind of

00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:30,420
similar idea totally but the thing is

00:53:27,799 --> 00:53:33,420
what you're doing is you're instituting

00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:36,270
a process for atonement without shame

00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:39,440
exactly thank you atonement without

00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:41,970
shape but see this is beautiful and I I

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,230
guess I'm sort of sensitive to using

00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,760
words that I feel are like in a

00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:47,160
religious context but like is atonement

00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,420
a universally understood concept does

00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,619
anyone want me to define it because this

00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,309
is a beautiful in this gentleman has

00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:55,890
said quite confusion ok cool so

00:53:53,309 --> 00:53:57,270
atonement and I only know about this in

00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:59,910
a religious context so it may exist in

00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:02,849
other contexts is the idea that we are

00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:04,619
imperfect we have made a mistake and

00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:06,630
since it is known that we are imperfect

00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:10,859
and that we will make mistakes there is

00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:12,839
a ritualized process for sort of erasing

00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:16,470
that mistake from the social

00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:18,510
consciousness right so maybe it's to

00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:19,980
atone to atone for my sin of breaking

00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:22,710
the build i buy everybody donuts right

00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,329
and and by ritual izing that there is an

00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:26,730
acknowledgement again of failure is

00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:29,430
inevitable here's how you get over it

00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:30,960
here's how we move on cool thank you

00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:35,819
very much i love that i may i may steal

00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:37,529
that phrase for a future talk the

00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:40,020
problem I see with this is the cases

00:54:37,529 --> 00:54:42,720
where the failure is not necessarily

00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:44,279
attributable to one person breaking the

00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,799
bill that's clear that's a fact it's

00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:49,060
provable but if you know overall a

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,410
project didn't go as it should have and

00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,810
were late and it's kind of a collective

00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:54,490
fault it seems to me that the act of

00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,140
trying to find the guilty person that

00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,580
this would be the one buying cake yeah

00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:59,110
actually makes things worse because now

00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,400
we have defined this person is

00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:02,080
responsible instead of saying

00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,270
collectively we fail because of many

00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,130
reasons i agree with you completely and

00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:07,540
in cases like that where it's where it's

00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:09,760
not something where you can point

00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:11,350
directly to it that's when your group

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,550
leader like let's say that this is a

00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:14,500
team this is when the manager goes and

00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,060
buys donuts because it's the manager's

00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,620
job to make sure that all of you can be

00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,450
successful and we weren't as successful

00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,920
as we wanted to be so that's cool I've

00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:22,150
got donuts for all of you and we're

00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,650
going to talk about how we can all be

00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:26,350
more successful together as a group and

00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:27,700
then there's no process of like well

00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:29,170
let's talk about why you sucked and

00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,460
let's talk about why you sucked right so

00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:33,360
that this is why you're a leader right

00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,360
because you get to take one for the team

00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:40,720
well I would suggest that you can also

00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,940
make really tasty donuts but yes also

00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,100
just just just my dear friends we are

00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,600
all flawed human beings budget I just

00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,280
get yourself a dessert budget you'll be

00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,110
happy that you did and if anyone is

00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,150
having trouble I have tips on reasonably

00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:54,400
priced desserts yes nice gentleman so

00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,930
the reason sort of flip side to that one

00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,120
which you see it doesn't have to be the

00:55:55,930 --> 00:56:00,910
boss ain't anybody in the team who's

00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:02,350
capable of owning the failure and can

00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:04,630
just pick it up and say okay I'll take

00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:06,370
that and I'm going to accept

00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,870
responsibility for this and ok everybody

00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:10,270
else was involved but that's ok I'm

00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:12,430
going to get the cake that is totally

00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,140
call and the person who can do that can

00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:15,700
thereby help the team to recover from

00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,230
what it suffered because they'll know

00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,930
damn well they contribute it just as

00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:22,450
much and they're accepting that it you

00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:24,370
don't have to be Boss to be leader this

00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:26,470
is true you do not have to be the boss

00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:31,540
to be a leader and that that is awesome

00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:33,040
I I find that there are fewer brave

00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,120
souls in the world who are willing to do

00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,260
what you have just suggested that I

00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,430
would like but I wouldn't like to

00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:42,310
encourage their growth and development

00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:45,490
thank you hello nice person I again

00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:48,880
about just distributed teams do you

00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:51,970
think there's a inherent difference in

00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,940
fail culture between different parts of

00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:57,940
the world that you can tell oh man

00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:00,730
that's a great question so um I actually

00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,150
give a talk just focusing on failure and

00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:05,660
maybe this is my own inherent

00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:07,069
like uh like self-loathing as an

00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:09,230
American I think Americans are really

00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:13,970
not okay with failing right like we all

00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:16,809
got told for years that you know on the

00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:18,710
Apollo 13 mission which failed like

00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:20,660
horrifically to the point where like

00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:22,640
there was no drinking water and the heat

00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:25,160
failed and all this other crap that like

00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,589
oh my god failure is not an option and

00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,700
Wow America triumphed and all the

00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:30,319
astronauts came back to earth safely

00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,900
except that never actually happened that

00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:35,750
was in a movie from 1985 where that was

00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:37,730
said right so I feel like I feel like

00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:40,010
Americans like are really uncomfortable

00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:41,809
with failure and I can say I because I

00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:45,650
can speak for all Americans being one

00:57:41,809 --> 00:57:50,210
you know yeah totally um I have also

00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:51,680
noted that it in some cultures I think

00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:54,289
in some Asian cultures like it is really

00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,480
not okay to fail like if you if you

00:57:54,289 --> 00:57:58,160
shame yourself through failing in front

00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,490
of an authority figure that can be like

00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:04,039
a really like socially devastating thing

00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:05,180
to have happen to you I don't want to

00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:06,200
talk a lot about this because it's not

00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,490
something with which I'm directly

00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,849
familiar but this is something that I

00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:12,170
have heard about from folks in Asia who

00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:13,640
want to participate in free software

00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:15,500
projects talking about bringing more

00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:18,049
people into free software projects and

00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:21,109
there and a lot of the hesitancy comes

00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:23,720
from the idea that if you are providing

00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:25,400
work to the community or to a maintainer

00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,650
who is like an authority figure and they

00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:30,920
say that the patch is imperfect because

00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:33,440
which pastures ever perfect that that

00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:35,960
you tend to lose people right there

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,609
because there's a sense of social stigma

00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,869
and shame attached to that as a failure

00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:42,829
as opposed to a kind of a learning

00:58:38,869 --> 00:58:46,700
experience so that's that's what I know

00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:48,049
about that I don't know I really like

00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,819
Europe so i'm going to say all of you

00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:51,470
are totally fine with failure because i
