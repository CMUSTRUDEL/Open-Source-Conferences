hello everybody it's very nice to be a

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,839
pair to be here at get calm my name is

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:19,939
Sandra and Roger I have a slide to

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,859
present myself I work at a professor at

00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:26,810
federal institute of technology in

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:31,320
Brazil I've been using cutie and KD

00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:35,309
technologies for some years already I'm

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,160
contributing to KD since 2000 h I

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,700
started doing some game development at

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,270
glue on and then I did some work on k

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,969
develop and / has made and lately I've

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,950
been working mostly by doing some

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,480
community management in Latin America

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:59,850
and in last month doing some KD stuff

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,890
what is what that talk is about and also

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,700
i'm a member of the board of their

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:10,470
directors of KETV since like a last year

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:14,720
and of course i'm completely mad about

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:18,360
music and thats talk is about that and

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,400
this talk is to about two really amazing

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,460
things which are free software and music

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,420
or cute and music or KDE and music you

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,000
pick up your favorite combination and

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,970
and freely free software and music are

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,200
really close friends and close friends

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:39,360
usually do many things together so we

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,920
have many pretty cool free software

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,009
solutions for music stuff out there we

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:52,520
have a lot of software for and

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:56,719
music publishing and must keep music

00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:01,200
production and say sound synthesis and

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:04,530
Middies sequency so we have a lot of

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,170
pretty good free software for doing

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,170
music people are doing music in their

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,110
house nowaday with a computer and submit

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,440
a MIDI sequencing and do me really good

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,840
good

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,570
stuff but I also as ever lee every nice

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,810
friends there are many things there they

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,660
aren't very good at doing together so

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,200
while someone may prefer to go to the

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,150
beach his friend made one choose Mel

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,250
flowers in some place in the countryside

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:41,010
so free software and in music and most

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,930
specifically free software for music

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:49,290
education is still at topic with with

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:51,960
where we lack so there are no many free

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,770
software solutions for music education

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:59,250
nowadays we have some attend like news

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:03,090
solfege which is pretty complete but I

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:07,820
think we can have something doing more

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:11,940
more nice work for for music education

00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:16,710
so actually i started doing something in

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:19,410
a at that way in 2010 when one of my

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:25,440
students started we started to develop a

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:28,650
spin a apparently i have some word word

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,130
preference for word ending in ad but

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:34,410
this is only a consequence so at that

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,860
time we were doing really crappy

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:41,940
software for music education it was

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,700
based on cute for and katie lips for but

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,390
it was completely over an engineering

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,870
and the students got graduated i was

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:54,920
called a quite busy doing my PhD and we

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:59,700
didn't manage to push that forward and

00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:02,610
only five years later last year then i

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,850
decided to start developing developing

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:09,200
mini way as my personal project of

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:13,950
course working i also with students or

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:17,760
anyone else who want to contribute and i

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:20,850
was pretty happy in see this project

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,080
getting our first release after only six

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:27,389
month of work so of course it hasn't

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,379
many many features because

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:37,979
there was only six months of work but it

00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:41,639
it works basically in focusing on ear

00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:43,770
training exercise so the goal of this

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,249
have a the software right now is to

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:50,069
provide you a set of exercises to

00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:53,159
training your ear so where you should

00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:57,180
listen to some musical concept a concept

00:04:53,159 --> 00:05:00,419
and you should a user are expected that

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,620
you recognize a what is being played by

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:06,900
the software right so but what is min

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,000
away after all it's a free software for

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,389
supporting teachers and students in play

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,759
their roles for all soft sort of music

00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,849
related educational content I like to

00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:21,360
think about it that in that a a broader

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:24,750
sense because we can virtually have

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:29,490
anything related to music education on

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:34,319
it and of course we don't intend to

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:37,759
address the other aspects for music that

00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,949
are currently quite well covered by the

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,069
existence solutions for music production

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:47,339
and so on it's developed by the KD

00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:49,949
coming a come community a community the

00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:55,069
website its mini Wade quedate org and

00:05:49,949 --> 00:06:00,089
since its inception we wanted it to be

00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:03,569
extensible to new content so and a user

00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:06,689
are currently able to introduce to

00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:10,680
introduce new exercise by only adding

00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:12,839
new JSON files all the exercise are

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,490
specified in JSON file so where you can

00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:21,120
create new exercise with no new lines of

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,669
source code we wanted it should be

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,939
available on multiple platform and for

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:30,180
multiple form factors and we want it to

00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:34,050
be a hub to leverage the use of open

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,620
data for music education and we want it

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,750
to be driven by real real users needs so

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,070
we have a kind of partner

00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:45,720
partnership with the music school at

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:49,110
federal university of by ear where I

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,020
leave when some friends are helping us

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:57,540
by doing some specialized music

00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:00,000
education help okay so currently we have

00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:03,420
ear training exercises in four

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,190
categories we have exercised for

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:10,440
recognizing short intervals rhythms and

00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:14,550
scales but new exercise may be easily

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:17,130
define it by by creating new JSON files

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,540
and some features for volume picture

00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:24,900
pitch and tempo control so that isn't a

00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:28,500
too much right right right now but we

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:31,169
assure that it's working so better than

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:39,630
say talking we can have some brief

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:42,540
demonstration now so it should a min way

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,540
should be already available in most use

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:49,979
it distributions so just install it it's

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:52,260
part of KDA do so if you install KDE I

00:07:49,979 --> 00:08:02,870
do we should already have mini way

00:07:52,260 --> 00:08:06,740
installed on your computer so we

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:10,190
basically a navigation menu that menu is

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,770
completely built dynamically from the

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:16,040
JSON files that are currently installed

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:18,650
on your machine so if you add a new JSON

00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,660
file you should expect to automatically

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:24,070
appear some new cut they cut it a

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:28,880
category category or new access a

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:32,350
exercise subjects ER sighs so for charts

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:36,380
we have a bunch of categories for

00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:40,400
recognizing a lot of different kinds of

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:43,550
chore charts so we can start start with

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,020
a pretty very simple exercise where it

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:50,060
should be able to to recognize not to

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,180
recognize the difference between a minor

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:56,840
and a major short so you can click it on

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,750
a new exercise so that's quite hard

00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:07,100
because it's in a very low range of the

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:09,590
piano so you can ask to play again it's

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:13,250
quite difficult do you have any

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:18,950
musicians on the audience right now okay

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:24,050
at one okay sounds more major let's see

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:26,400
if you are good okay no it's a minor

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,980
chart but yeah

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,440
yeah so let's try again okay new

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,790
question hopefully each it will be up

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:39,270
here in a either range right okay that's

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:44,760
pretty cool that's a major short right

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:49,040
okay okay and it shows the right answer

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,920
there by small circles on the piano

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,070
keyboard so you can keep trying and or

00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:00,590
click on give up if you move your mouse

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:02,760
over the possible answers you see the

00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,640
representation of that enter on the

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,160
keyboard track and you can just give up

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:16,020
to see a what a what is the right answer

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:18,990
yes a video no just the first note of

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:23,280
the chart is white because that's the

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:26,250
tonic note and the other surveys circles

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:37,400
are painted with the same color of the

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:42,990
the answer okay we can try something

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:45,030
yeah yeah sure that can be a chem

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,210
becomes quite complicated if you have a

00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:51,529
lot of charts to difference between them

00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:56,370
so that's quite that's a

00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:59,220
three chief good short I won't try I

00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:02,339
would just give up and this is a very

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:07,670
very tense short right so we have

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:11,820
similar we have similar exercise for

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:13,980
detecting a inter intervals just agent

00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:18,450
detecting thirds is a quite easy

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:22,649
exercise as well so this is a minor

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:26,160
third okay I'm very good on it so that's

00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:28,170
why I'm showing you that one so but it

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,620
can also becomes really really difficult

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:37,010
if you have a lot of this is a all so

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:43,800
simple right this is a major third I

00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:48,510
have no idea so and we have also and

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:51,930
some rhythm recall a record initial X

00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:56,610
exercise where the tool will play you

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:59,190
for sequence of randomly chosen with

00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:02,459
them pate patterns and you should be

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:07,170
able to recognize and which sequence of

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:22,050
resent patters it was played so let us

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:27,870
hurt again I think

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:34,920
that one yes but if if you select some

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:38,130
wrong answer for example and it shows

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,760
you which answers were wrong and which

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:45,779
answers you selected right so basically

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,750
that's what we have so far so let's go

00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:51,600
back to the presentation and this is the

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:55,890
architecture for the first version we

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,500
released on April this year it's quite

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,529
simple architecture because that was

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,130
what we need at that time so we have a

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:08,279
very simple core where an exercise

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:10,860
controller reads the JSON files which is

00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:14,610
specified the exercise do a merge

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:18,269
between a all of those files and and

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:21,529
make them available for for creating the

00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:25,670
navigation menu we have a midi sequencer

00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:29,220
at that time with a very high couple

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:31,709
implementation to the drumstick library

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:35,010
and they also Jimmy D G and three pads

00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:38,010
so that's it was a quite limiting factor

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:41,610
at this first architecture and then I

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:44,310
bench adventure of qml coach which

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:47,430
dynamically built deducted the

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:51,350
navigation menu and also the available

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:55,470
answers for a given egg a exercise and

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:57,899
in the second release we did on one

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,630
month ago we made some improvements on

00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:04,740
that architecture on that architecture

00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:06,839
and exact delhi to set the stage for

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:10,170
having mini way running on different

00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:13,399
platforms so now we have a plug-in based

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:17,339
architecture where all the features

00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:20,130
related to sound have been moving for a

00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:23,370
given plugging so where you can you can

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:26,070
create a given a new plug-in for having

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:29,459
mini way running on a new platform so on

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:33,209
on desktop currently we use float seen

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:35,360
as a plug-in which is more easily to use

00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:39,440
then run then drums

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:43,040
and also we did a lot of refactoring on

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,370
key a key ml code we moved to use cute

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,220
kids quick controls to exact tellytube

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:53,990
to make the content de coche convergence

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:56,209
for mobile either and so that's is the

00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:01,970
current architecture for the second

00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:05,390
release okay three months ago where we

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:09,380
got on gtalk student accepted to work on

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:12,800
mini wait he's a huge shaft from angel

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:17,060
who did a very pretty nice work when

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,089
creating a android version 4 min way

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,040
which contains all those same versions

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:25,100
you'll find on the desktop version right

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,690
so it's available on Google Google Play

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:34,430
Store we publish it it's two weeks ago

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:40,339
so it's have already to 250 downloads

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:42,980
it's not bad I think okay so I for in

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:46,100
the android solution we are using kid

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,800
quick controls to for the UI and we use

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,730
see sound for implementing the back end

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,610
in android right i also use afloat

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:59,510
scenes to send MIDI events for handling

00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:02,449
media events in Android and the GM bank

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:05,600
saw as soundfont to actually produce the

00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:09,050
sounds and the bit system is provided by

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,940
extra see make modules which where you

00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,640
have everything to build and deploy

00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,850
android applications already available

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,209
which is pretty good so I have it

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,940
running on my phone but I prepare a

00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:24,829
video by demonstrating the android

00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,829
version you can install it on your phone

00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:31,370
basically we have this is the initial

00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:36,920
initial screen we have a very usual

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:41,930
navigation drawer where you can and run

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:47,149
across the categories we also develop

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:48,460
and an initial that a dashboard which

00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:50,770
presents them

00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,500
the visual exercise categories which

00:16:50,770 --> 00:17:03,190
allow you to jump directly to a given

00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:08,220
exercise category and it uses the same

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:11,950
JSON files for defining the exercise so

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:15,430
we have some challenges when designing

00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:18,430
this user interface for a small small

00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:22,300
screams so basically for the verb to

00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:26,650
open we implemented some some horizontal

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:28,900
scrolling feature to just jump to the

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:34,600
right session of the piano it where the

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:38,110
exercise is playing something ok and at

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,260
that at that that block available

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:44,560
answers we have also a vertical scroll

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:47,020
to enable us to present exercise with a

00:17:44,560 --> 00:18:00,310
large number of available available

00:17:47,020 --> 00:18:03,160
answers I also exercise for with them

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:07,360
recover mediation if you select some

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:09,940
wrong pattern it show then adds that red

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,570
rectangles when you can tap on it and

00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:20,500
see which is the right answer for that

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:24,100
exercise right ok that's a harder recent

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:28,590
rich with recognition exercise it's also

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,590
available at the desktop version right

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:43,610
okay that's it so thanks to AI o Shah

00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:47,960
for doing that thing and okay so

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:50,570
basically what's next so now we are sure

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,090
that you a weekend having it to running

00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,779
on the desktop we can have any to

00:18:53,090 --> 00:19:00,260
running on Linux the new a architecture

00:18:55,779 --> 00:19:03,440
will hopefully make easier to have it

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:07,970
running on Windows or iOS or other

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,460
platform and now we need to to invent

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,610
some time to finish the code convergence

00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:17,179
a lot of components are actually reused

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:19,669
between those two versions but still we

00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:23,059
still have some working to do you have a

00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:27,049
really unique code base with a really

00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:29,630
unique build system we are working on it

00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:32,390
now we want to rethink the user

00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:34,490
experience because just after you go

00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,250
through an experience I've developed

00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:40,760
some kind of application you get a firm

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:43,840
grasp of how user interface should work

00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:47,000
on mobile platform so where you should

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:51,230
rethink how we want to implement those

00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,090
workflows with you need to improve the

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:58,669
UI for tablets we're good some feedback

00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:02,270
for something to improve Forte for

00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:05,659
tablets we still need to implement

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:08,840
music support for having those exercise

00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:13,610
I also represented by using the regular

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:16,880
notation for for music we want to chew

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:19,850
extending to extend it to support author

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,620
music content because right now we have

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:27,529
only ear training exercise but we plan

00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,409
to add something related to music theory

00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:34,480
or to improvisation or to harmony or

00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:38,659
other aspects of music education and

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,770
also a nice feature is to let you have

00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:45,180
it able to

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:47,790
to to recognize nice answers by allowing

00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:51,450
the user to sing the interval for

00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:54,090
example or to answer with them exercise

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,580
by clapping at your hand and having the

00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:00,390
microphone detecting if you are clapping

00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:04,800
in the right way or in the runway so a

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:07,200
lot of work to do and I can't finish

00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,230
this presentation without doing a very

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,440
thank you for a decade e community tube

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:18,180
to provide all the support to have this

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:23,340
happen in only six months so I'm really

00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:27,720
happy to get to see all the things that

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:31,560
that KD can provide you been using use

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:36,300
it at these work so we managed to come

00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:38,850
up with a website and the source code

00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:42,270
repository tasks and called over a

00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:46,830
overview continuous integration so it's

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:49,500
more more more easier to put something

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:52,140
out with we have a very amazing

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:57,420
community providing you everything you

00:21:52,140 --> 00:22:00,210
need to make it happen ok join us we are

00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:03,180
currently a very small team it's just

00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:07,050
myself and I oh she shy and another

00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:11,760
developer one design doing the icons and

00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:14,820
those things and two more guys with who

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,510
helped with music content so we need

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:21,530
more people working on it and so you can

00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:25,860
help of course by coding but I also

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:28,620
bring some music feedback on it or by

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:31,230
doing some artwork translating or just

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,470
chillin it with people this is nice as

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:38,250
well so we can talk to us at the kitty

00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:44,330
ado maidenly mailing list or the kitty I

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:44,330
do IRC channel infernal and

00:22:44,590 --> 00:23:04,809
thanks for your attention and Bauer has

00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:07,960
have n question okay Mario yes yes of

00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:11,140
course a although creating JSON file is

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:14,020
quite a either it's more easier than

00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,630
doing things in code but of course

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:19,450
having a visual editor tube to produce

00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:23,559
the JSON files if is a really really

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:33,309
nice feature here any other question

00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:37,120
yeah and not yet but yes maybe you can

00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:41,320
just get all the categories and

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,899
selecting some random thing but I guess

00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:48,460
for teachers and students they usually

00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:52,000
have a very specific flow of how to

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:57,429
apply exercise choice to students by

00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,130
starting with a very easy level of your

00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:15,520
training exercise and then improving to

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:31,600
two more harder exercise so yeah yeah

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:32,200
that can be done sure sure yes so we

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,679
have

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:39,070
4month releases cycle for application in

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:42,970
in KD so I guess the Nexus schedule

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,490
isn't isn't available yet but you can

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:48,159
join us at any time we can do what we

00:24:45,490 --> 00:25:01,899
can have it done for the next release

00:24:48,159 --> 00:25:06,220
yeah sure yes against you yes that's in

00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:10,919
our plan as well and actually that's the

00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:14,580
part when it goes more so so so show or

00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:17,230
leveraging the user of open data and

00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:21,070
it'd be really awesome met with

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:24,130
something in in Cuba make some some some

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:27,789
exercise regard some latching music and

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:31,210
made it available on the KDE store and

00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:34,360
then fne a user using mean we could

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:41,649
download and start doing some something

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:49,200
yeah it's a really cool feature more

00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:49,200
questions yeah I can show

00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:07,990
you

00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:21,779
ok this is under is on fire for the the

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,330
first version of mini way we've done

00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:28,289
some improvements on it but it's

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:30,929
basically on hierarchical JJ zone where

00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:34,610
you define the categories for example

00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:38,519
this is for the cat the category of int

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:42,419
intervals here you define the range

00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:45,690
where the randomly shoes root note is

00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:49,350
pick up by the software so here yeah I'm

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:53,159
defined from 21 to 104 which is the

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:56,100
rolly piano range so you can prevent it

00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:58,950
for creating exercise on the very low

00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:03,840
range of the piano by increasing that

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:09,360
first number to anyone and then you hear

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:13,350
define and a given and a given exercise

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:16,320
exercise so this is this so this is the

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:19,769
exercise I've just show you that one

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,549
that recognized thirds so you have two

00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:26,279
possible answers for this exercise it

00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:29,880
can be a minor third or a major third

00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:34,409
and here you just put a sequence of

00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:37,289
nodes which reaper a whip represents how

00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:41,039
far are each node from the root position

00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:45,240
so if you see if you have a piano

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:49,019
keyboard like that one if this is the

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:53,370
root node which is randomly choose if

00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:57,200
you count one two three you have a minor

00:27:53,370 --> 00:28:00,120
third right so that is that number here

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,690
representing a minor third and if you

00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:07,350
count for that is a major third so four

00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:11,850
scales you do something similar for a

00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:15,690
major scale that's the sequence of

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:19,830
distances from the root note to form a

00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:23,659
major scale so it isn't that hard to to

00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,659
create your a URL

00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:30,110
