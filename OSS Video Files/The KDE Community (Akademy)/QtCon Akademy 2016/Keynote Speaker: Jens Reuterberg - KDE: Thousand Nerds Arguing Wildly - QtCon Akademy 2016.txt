Title: Keynote Speaker: Jens Reuterberg - KDE: Thousand Nerds Arguing Wildly - QtCon Akademy 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: QtCon Akademy 2016
Description: 
	We often talk about the hope that someone should come “and just make people do the right thing”. Complain that we are too disorganised, that we are too nerdy and technical. I want to argue that we are and that while that may have some bad effects on us, it is also one of the things that makes us great. We should cherish it and use it instead of fighting it. This conversation is about how we do that.

i'm going to start so bit we are no it's

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,730
not fun night this is the boring part it

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,109
can be both it's maybe a single maybe

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,109
you know you'll have to check it out

00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,349
yeah it's a sale so this is a talk

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,360
called kitty a fashion arts arguing

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,530
wildly like you notice we're not that

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,719
many here whether that's because Lydia

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,969
scared them all away with her threats of

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,710
violence or if it was we were missed in

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,829
the little application that they made I

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,530
don't know it's going to be fine this

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,210
talk comes with a few rules first of all

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,280
my name is Janice right right assume

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,149
most of you know I'm in the Katie design

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,859
group and I'm also variable phobic I

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,170
always say this in front all talks that

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm a freak out I'm a piss myself

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,920
myself punch someone in the front row

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:11,070
and then yeah brilliant and Lydia is

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,799
here to make sure that I get driven off

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,200
the hospital if that happens or if she

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,340
managed to read my notes which i have

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,220
hidden here this is not a clean out

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,090
because key notes are boring or Aquino

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,710
would need would boring it's a

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,439
conversation with a cake it's a

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,299
conversational reddit and that is

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,490
because I want to keep with the theme of

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,009
the talk which is a thousand nerds are

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,799
in wildly and the theme will be

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,740
expressed by your possibility to vote

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,530
upvote or download and if you like

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,340
something I say you raise your thumb up

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,950
and scream yes or yay and if you don't

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,310
like something I say you put a give a

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,079
thumbs down and scream boo if you have

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,799
questions you can raise your hands and

00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,979
scream them out or better go to this

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,340
address which is a red thread on the

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,580
kiddie read it and write something down

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,550
Lydia will read it and then tell me the

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,990
question whenever whenever I have a

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:18,240
often discussions that's the perfect

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,920
situation a little ensure that you vote

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,440
will get hurt she would count the years

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,510
& boos and if there's too many boos I'll

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,880
try to switch topic so you have a chance

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,830
to influence whatever I'm saying all

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,860
right and before we start I want to try

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:38,660
can we just give like a downvote Abu

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,660
more thumbs boot born I louder please

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,370
that's brilliant to having a video by

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:49,820
the way like oh check the keynote the

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,820
boo we have to do a clip of that okay

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:58,890
this is not 1984 this is not the heat

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:05,040
our just wait wait give me a second let

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:09,870
us about least talk about it so there we

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,390
are whenever I introduce myself on these

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,870
things i mentioned that i am an

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,030
illustrator before i mentioned that i am

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,550
a designer because that's where i come

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:24,570
from I'm illustrator first and foremost

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:26,790
right and the reason I do that is

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,350
because and this might be a horrible

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,230
thing to say because there's the sinus

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:35,640
in the crowd is that I don't like

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:40,830
designers very much at all to be quite

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:43,050
honest so designers have a thing there's

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,300
a very specific class of designer which

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,959
believes that everything this guy made

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:52,380
ever is the best thing that has ever

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,560
been made ever ever ever ever and they

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:59,670
always the same weird story which is a

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:03,330
story about when Steve Jobs walked in on

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:07,500
a planning meeting for a CD or DVD

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:10,140
burner application and they it always

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,580
starts off the same way right so they

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,100
were making in two thousand they were

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,620
making a DVD application a burner for

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,109
dvds and they have been working with

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,630
this for three weeks they've been doing

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,100
this one thing like there was a group of

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,450
people they've done this DVD burner

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,120
thing they worked on it they didn't

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,650
research

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,560
they've sort of played around with the

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,940
science to doubt everything and they're

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,150
supposed to have this meeting with steve

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,360
jobs and steve jobs walks in and the

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:40,090
story goes that he drew a square on the

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,970
whiteboard he loved whiteboards and said

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,639
this is a box you drop the file in the

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,169
box and click burn and then it's done

00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,199
this is what we're going to do and then

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:53,580
he left and the signers always go oh my

00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:56,500
god that's so brilliant what a genius at

00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,720
all i can think of all I've always been

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,810
able to think of at those moments is

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,729
what happened with those guys like the

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,889
guys who just worked for weeks and weeks

00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:07,510
and weeks about like what are we going

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:10,720
to do we're going to do this thing oh

00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:13,570
it's going to be a DVD player and then

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,060
this man walks in and change everything

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,430
and they have to fix it that's why I

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,250
don't like this guy and it's a common

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,020
theme with KD with us specifically for

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,340
those to us in official design group or

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,770
the design group depending on how you

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,960
want to say it is that we often get told

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,990
like we need more design more designing

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,410
make more designing and they want us to

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,599
sort of be bossy and go in and should go

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,770
right this is what we're going to do

00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,060
you're going to do that you're going to

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,190
do that it's going to be awesome we're

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,320
going to be brilliant together and they

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,260
want that sort of bossy attitude like

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,330
they want that glorified dictator and we

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,789
can't be that and this talk will sort of

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,940
talk about why we can't have that sort

00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:58,120
of bossiness why we are a thousand nerds

00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:02,039
arguing loudly and angrily and why

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,690
that's can be an actually good thing and

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,990
when people want us to be more like

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:11,139
Steve Jobs and want Katie to be more

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,660
like Apple and be more designing be a

00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:17,680
little bit more flashy I'm always sort

00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:20,260
of thinking that my god there will be a

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,030
monster and we wouldn't be able to do

00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,830
that either because we can't be bossy

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,650
where should it be bossy we're not good

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,990
at it it would probably be this that's

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:32,669
that's that's my image of the future if

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,630
that came to be happily insanely

00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:38,470
screaming honking

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:43,210
clutching its own not a pretty

00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:49,150
sight like I said we can't be Steve Jobs

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:53,050
right because we are angry nerds we're

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,030
frustrated we do our own thing we sort

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,800
of play around with stupid ideas some of

00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,800
us hate what half of us are doing and

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,830
the other half don't care and that can

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,380
be a really really awesome idea if we

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,620
embrace it properly and one of the

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,780
reasons we can't deal with 10 reasons

00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,670
why it's good by the way is that

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,280
structures and that level of here icky

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,440
needed it first of all wouldn't work

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,880
like I said because imagine it imagine

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,220
me stepping up to say Alex right and I

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,490
tell Alex Alex stop what you're doing

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,890
right now and program this faith this

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,080
amazing faith what would happen in elect

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,430
or anyone else in this room if someone

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,720
came up to you and told you no no no

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,580
you're not going to do the thing you

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,530
love you're going to do the thing I love

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,750
and you're going to do it now the

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:45,270
probable thing would be the infamous

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:47,920
nvidia salute and we'd see it like that

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,270
we like no I'm not going to do it I'm

00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,420
going to do something else and goodbye

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:54,130
we're going to lose people quickly if we

00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,990
start doing that and that's one of the

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,350
counter-arguments really toward said

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:04,540
because the point with having this this

00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:07,360
really thick structure a herpe of people

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,400
a boss who has a boss believe him or her

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,590
who has the balls beneath him or her and

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,060
they all get to decide thing the cool

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,090
thing would hear keys is that it's

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,860
efficient like you get a unified design

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,010
you get everything is released really

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,260
quickly downside is that it lacks all

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,480
all the things that we have currently

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,430
but don't see because again we're angry

00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,420
nerds we don't sort of appreciate the

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:35,140
fact that we're angry nerds here at keys

00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:37,840
is efficient but dude is sort of my

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,400
point and I don't want to use Steve Jobs

00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,700
an apple because it's talking a love the

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,190
dead but it's sort of remarkable that

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,990
the second the boss disappeared it all

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,510
just fell down like a house

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,940
ards all the fanboys and fangirls went

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,490
this is horrible and sort of tried to

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,260
raise the seance or something and it

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,060
didn't work and the reason for that is

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,160
because of that strict chain that we

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,690
don't have again I want to focus this is

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,510
what we don't have that many of us

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,180
really want and I want to sort of

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,000
emphasize why this is so important that

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,730
we don't have it and how important it is

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,680
that we embrace what we do have the

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,630
angry the narrated Assad and there are

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,470
many reasons why a strict hierarchy is

00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:24,700
sort of crud and it's obvious I mean

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:27,790
it's here and it's that clear path of

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,070
power or absolute trust and that's the

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,660
main key with hierarchies is that if you

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,480
don't have if I don't have complete

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,940
control over you if I can't fire you or

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,070
throw you out the room then there's no

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,830
reason for you to bit obey me right all

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:44,050
you can do is trust me and trust is

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,899
almost impossible to build it's really

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,610
easy for me to go well I own the company

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,800
so trust trust me trust me really quick

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,140
come on come on chop-chop and we're

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,579
sitting there going like ok ok I'll I'm

00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,980
trusting you you're apparently very rich

00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:58,120
that's fine and then we sort of move

00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,529
along with it but trust doesn't work

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,589
like that trust is something that you

00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:07,690
build bit by bit and it's incredibly

00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:10,029
easy to lose right it's insanely quick

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,300
to lose and if you remove any part of

00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,950
the chain as well because it's not just

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,560
everyone trusting the boss it is

00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,390
trusting the boss that is above you who

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,980
trust the boss above you and you have to

00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,870
do the same and up and up and up and up

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,740
until you get the person making all the

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:30,070
decisions and if that chain is broken at

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,690
any point it's lost it's meaningless and

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,670
I know it like like I said this is not

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,779
criticism towards ke because we don't

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,630
have it but I just want to emphasize

00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:39,760
this before I keep talking about it

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,800
because it's such a relevant topic to us

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,260
because many of us we always believe

00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,149
that it's going to be some person coming

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,310
in the door going like I'm the new

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:49,300
Savior and then starts telling people

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,459
what to do and it's going to be great

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,560
because in our mind we think we're the

00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,959
smartest in the room right so we think

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,079
that obviously this sort of benevolent

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,010
dictator will think exactly like me it's

00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,480
going to be great

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,040
but it's not going to be like that half

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,000
of the things he or she says it's going

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,950
to be the opposite the other part of

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,470
this is what we do have which is self

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:14,200
organization and that's tricky and we

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:17,170
all know it's tricky I know everyone I'm

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,290
sure everyone in this room have one of

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,870
those stories from Katie like that that

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:26,620
moment that happened where everything

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,360
just went to crud and if we all sat down

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,490
and argued about something I'm looking

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,230
at Thomas 54 specifically because we can

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,170
argue until the cows come home and

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,300
nothing happens and that's that's bad

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,600
obviously because everything takes twice

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,340
as long there's no real direction

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,440
argument just keep going on and on and

00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:48,790
on and debates are the easiest thing to

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:52,090
have it's easy to get trust because at a

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,890
certain point you know that say Lydia I

00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,780
know that Lydia is doing her thing I can

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,510
see the thing that she's doing sitting

00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,450
there and she can see my fame that I'm

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,740
doing here panicking and together we can

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,110
sort of trust the fact that we're doing

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,820
our own bed right we don't have to trust

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,830
each other but it's easier because we

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:13,000
can spot what everyone is doing it

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,970
doesn't automatically mean though that

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we share the same goal mean Lydia Lydia

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,700
might be currently thinking about

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,990
planting my murder and obviously i am

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,840
doing the same thing but the opposite

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,270
plotting her murder so you know like

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,150
direction is easily lost is easily

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:34,840
funnel away and debates just tend to

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,430
drown everything out it demands way more

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,370
social working to function and this is

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,590
one of the things i've talked about with

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:44,380
individuals a lot this is actually a key

00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:47,140
point that we always miss and I again

00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,060
it's because we're nerds we tend to be a

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,730
little social it socially awkward at

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:55,660
times and we don't ask those questions

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:58,600
there's one person that I talked to who

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:01,510
was not feeling that great but no one

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,370
had really asked why this person didn't

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,830
feel that great they just assumed that

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,270
oh if this person isn't telling then I'm

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,440
not going to bother me I don't want to

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,810
prod I won't be that want to be the

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,190
person who sort of just goes in and hey

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,630
hey tell me all your problems but we

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,210
need

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:17,190
that we need that social glue and we

00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,990
tend to forget it and it can also be

00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,180
part of a greater organization as well

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,610
the fact that we do social things

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,860
together not just coding not just

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:29,040
talking about this but talking about

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,810
ourselves talking about asking questions

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,940
about other members in KDE how are you

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,990
doing are you everything okay not taking

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,100
yeah everything is fine for an answer or

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,100
just asking further and further

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,810
questions we need to do that more for

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,940
this to function but we're sort of there

00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:47,520
but this is the complaints of our self

00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,050
organization that we have and everyone

00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,330
must feel comfortable in the role which

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:54,510
I think we can safely say neither of us

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:59,520
do right brilliant so we've messed that

00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:01,590
one up the cool thing though is the cool

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,330
the coolest thing about both methods no

00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,880
matter what we issues obviously I'm

00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,350
sided with self-organization that's some

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,990
of you might not be it doesn't matter

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:13,440
but one of the main main points that we

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:15,770
have to do in KD more way way way more

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,780
no matter what method we use is

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,880
inspiration and we tend to follow this

00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,310
ball we tend to drop it easily because

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,920
we tend to do oh I wrote a blog post

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,230
about the technical thing I did and no

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,470
one got it but that's fine like we just

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,180
mention it what we need to do is inspire

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,280
people to do things and this is a

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,470
constant conversation that I'm

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,290
mentioning Thomas again but me and

00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,210
Thomas have is that I want to do right

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,130
up the things that we haven't done and

00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:47,040
the weird plans that we've done and

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,720
we're nothing real has come of it yet he

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,240
on the other hand really wants us to

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,380
look let's wait for a second and not do

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,600
it because then people would be

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,630
disappointed if nothing happens both

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,550
arguments are obviously true and good

00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:01,200
but it's a difference of opinion I just

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,540
think that inspiration is something that

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,530
we're kinda bad at and should get better

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,690
at because we have so much to get

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,820
because and that's the main thing we're

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,830
nerds right everyone in this room has

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,870
probably been mom I'm not saying

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,820
probably but let's yeah you have

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,400
everyone in this room have been bullied

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,630
in high school it's a fact probably

00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,700
ninety percent 99

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,770
doesn't matter we've all been there we

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,630
will have that d key moments in teenage

00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:31,060
life and we will probably be nothing for

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:34,300
it we're nerds we have specific

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,090
interests that isn't shared by all we

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,190
tend to geek out really quickly we have

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:42,310
our fascination things and we tend to

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:46,990
like other nerds and we do it so well

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:49,210
and the thing is the thing that KD think

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,010
that you know has as well is that we're

00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:54,670
lacking developers we're lacking nerds

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:57,070
we need more nerds we need more people

00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,510
like us and when everyone else talks

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,790
about like oh I wish that Steve Jobs

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,710
looking character could come in with his

00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,360
turtleneck and its coffee cup lean on a

00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:06,550
table and screaming people and fire half

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,020
the audience then that's yeah okay

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,960
that's kind of good but then what we get

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,490
is designers and I know I'm a designer

00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,160
but what we get is the designers who

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,930
aren't nerds the people who don't get us

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,240
we should applaud what we are we should

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:22,270
try to get more people like us and we

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,400
have a safe way of doing it because we

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:28,840
know how to make them geek out we know

00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:31,390
how to make people like us feel like us

00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,430
about a thing because we do it so easily

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,960
we talk amongst ourselves and then

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,910
suddenly when we were supposed to talk

00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,040
with someone outside of our core group

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,560
we sort of their own remember not too

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,450
nerdy we have to be very sort of glitzy

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,160
about it and we tend to sort of want to

00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,630
slap the sign on everything because we

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,570
think that's what people look at but

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:52,300
it's not because what we want is the

00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:57,880
Nerds we want the massive nerds and we

00:16:52,300 --> 00:17:01,420
do no sorry water we do know how the

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:04,270
Apple because we're here we know what

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,939
attracted us we know what attracts us we

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,560
know what we feel like we should want to

00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:12,459
do and we know everything about

00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,589
ourselves so why don't we this is the

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,500
tricky bit right combine this with the

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,600
Steve Jobs lust combine this with this

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,699
wanting of something designing something

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,699
let's see something beautiful to sort of

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:26,770
cover up all the nerdiness combine this

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,230
with all those things that we sort of

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:34,360
assume we lack and therefore we have

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:36,559
less developers less bug fixes less

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,100
everything we

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,509
think that somehow if we just become a

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,419
little bit more designing everything

00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:46,759
would be grand if we get a little bit

00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:50,080
more less nerdy if we become one of the

00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:52,759
cool kids everything will be grand if we

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,529
start sort of acting more like the

00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:56,179
bullies in high school everything will

00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:59,509
be grand but it's not that's not how it

00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:01,700
works so when we start developing for

00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:04,700
example when we start doing applications

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:07,009
we tend to look at what Apple does and

00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,139
go oh I wish we did that I wish we did

00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:10,970
that thing we look at Microsoft and

00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:13,249
their professional sort of lineup of

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,799
application oh I I wish we did that and

00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:18,169
the most probable solution that we tend

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:21,700
to come to sadly because of all this is

00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:24,710
we tend to start a copy and the thing is

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,110
never ever copy we tend to do this so

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,549
easily and want to give some example

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:33,440
well actually I don't have to because it

00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:35,210
sort of mean liberals and the that

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,269
tendency to sort of go oh my god

00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:40,429
Microsoft Word is amazing I want to do

00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:44,029
that and then we try to copy wildly and

00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:45,320
on the one hand we do a good job I mean

00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:47,539
but there's still going to be carbon

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,600
copies and nothing else what we need to

00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:53,360
do is think for again think like the

00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,190
Nerds that we are think like the massive

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,429
nerds like where we are instead of going

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:01,190
what would other people like cooler

00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:03,350
people like and how can we get more

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,909
cooler people to like us so instead of

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,139
making things that are made for someone

00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:09,289
else we have to start considering

00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:11,059
ourselves as base and then try to get

00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:13,009
more nerds inspired and the only way to

00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,259
do it is to do things that we like and

00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:18,019
we are such massive nerds and we do such

00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:21,490
cool things like stupid weird little

00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:23,990
projects and we have these grand ideas

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,730
that we tend to beat down because oh

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:29,269
it's not like Microsoft Word so it's

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:32,450
there's no use to it we have to also

00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:39,450
learn how to do this and nothing happens

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:41,429
ah ah there we are that's the fame sorry

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,559
that's one of the things that we tend to

00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,750
miss we tend to mellow it down because

00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,419
we think that's professionalism that's

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,889
not we want to copy a little bit we want

00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,720
to make the new microsoft words but we

00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:53,730
want to scale it down we don't really

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,519
dream big and the thing is we're nerds

00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,559
we like big dreams we like really stupid

00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:01,049
dreams and we have done such great

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,130
stupid dreams take thick one of my

00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,320
favorite applications and one of the

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:08,909
reasons I came to linux at all is clean

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,799
up or could it done in Swedish it is the

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:13,830
best and the reason it's the best if

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,899
guess it doesn't really copy and the

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,809
reason to it's the best is because it's

00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:20,220
a stupid idea I mean imagine being in

00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:22,230
that me I'm sure they didn't have a

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,090
meeting i'm sure it went sort of more

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,860
organic and stuff like that but what if

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,480
there was a meeting with a lot of nerd

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,419
sitting around a table and one other

00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,940
went you know what i want to beat a

00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:34,789
photoshop at its own gain by not being

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,039
photoshop and it's going to make people

00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:39,809
start using linux and get us awards

00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,820
that's the dumbest idee ever and hurt

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,679
can you imagine that right here like I'm

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,269
gonna do this and then everything will

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,649
be fine and how are you going to do it

00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:48,779
while I'm going to do something that no

00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:49,889
one else has ever done before and it's

00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,840
going to be better than everything

00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:55,019
that's the grand plan of it and that's a

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,429
horrible plan like who the heck I'm

00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:59,370
trying to scale it down with the swear

00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:01,559
words who the heck would would even

00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:05,490
agree to help out but they did and they

00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:08,100
dream bigger way bigger way way way

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,840
bigger and now they are one of the

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,789
things that I can show two illustrative

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,590
friends for example and say well you try

00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:15,179
doing that with photoshop and come back

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,250
to me and they always come back to you

00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:20,519
and go how do i install this on my

00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,559
macbook and then i go you don't because

00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,360
I can't and I know it's possible but I'm

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,240
not good enough for it and I don't want

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:31,620
to be their support my guideline sorry

00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:35,370
but still the other thing that we never

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:36,960
ever seem to accept which I this is one

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,929
of my golden rules there's going to be

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,929
at ten holy rules for design speed talk

00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,130
or lightning talk I suggest that you go

00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:47,670
to it because this is one of the rules

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:49,380
and it's from simpsons obviously

00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,660
it's better magnificent failure than a

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,940
mediocre success and we should consider

00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,300
this way more and see that as a cool

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,250
thing I know we all fear failure we all

00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,570
like I do it right now it's part of the

00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,400
phobia thing of talking in front of

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,910
people I'm scared of doing this and this

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,320
but you do it because you hope and your

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,690
brother you should do it because you

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,810
hope that the failure would be so grand

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,130
so majestic the people will remember it

00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,710
for years and years and years you

00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,630
remember that Academy where young

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,100
himself then morphed and fell off the

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,810
stage and beat up his head and lady had

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,890
to drive him to the hospital that was

00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:27,360
amazing that's what I want I don't want

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,710
this sort of do you remember the time

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,270
that you answered us that stood there

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,620
and talked in a monotone voice about

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,120
something relevant to no one really

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,950
cared about it no one's going to

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,650
remember that tomorrow so better a

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,990
failure a massive failure than a

00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,390
mediocre success and that's again why we

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,480
shouldn't copy why we should dream big

00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,520
and why we should try to geek out don't

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,350
be scared of nerding out don't be scared

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,360
of not copying and try to strike your

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,060
own path because of worst-case scenario

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,310
it's going to be a massive magnificent

00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,560
failure and people will maybe point and

00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:00,900
laugh but they learn something and

00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,310
you'll learn something and everyone

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,510
would be a little bit inspired and see

00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:07,350
what didn't work and then try something

00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:09,390
else this is the last I don't have a

00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:12,990
good photo for this one because my hotel

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:15,090
has the most the worst wife I ever and

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,490
that but it's that's actually a key

00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:20,940
point here it's what we tend to do again

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:22,590
Steve Jobs Steve Jobs was a good

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,690
designer I know what's taking that away

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,060
one of the greatness of his design was

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,980
that he was a benevolent dictator he can

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,590
decide everything that ever happened and

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:34,410
that how you make a unified design and

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,270
we design unification is the first step

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,770
to make a great design that's

00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,570
unification if everything looks

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:42,240
different it doesn't matter how well

00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,660
everything look it has to look the same

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,230
and have to behave the same but he was

00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:51,960
most of all a great salesman he was a

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:55,860
wonderful salesman he could step in and

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,510
sell anything to anyone obviously with

00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,140
the new iphone you can sort of see it

00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:03,210
but still

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:06,100
we have to again embrace the nerdiness

00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,410
we have to look at the people who

00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:12,070
actually do stuff and not the people who

00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:14,950
talk about the stuff IE me ignore me and

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:17,800
talk more of it with people like let's

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:20,980
see if Marco is here somewhere there he

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,950
is take Marco for example I'm sorry

00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:27,160
Marco better take Marco the first time I

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,600
met him it I and he sort of showed me a

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,810
little bit of what he worked on I

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,120
thought he was a bit the closest thing I

00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:36,070
could think of was a wizard that was my

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,500
actual thought like oh this guy is more

00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,360
or less a wizard like I had this image

00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,280
in my head of someone from a TV show

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,320
about hackers doing cool things like

00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,820
doing click clack and then sort

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,660
of suddenly a house blows up and

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,310
everything's awesome some reason when we

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:55,300
have there's like everyone in this room

00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:58,480
do cool things on a daily basis like we

00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:01,420
do stuff that everyone not in this room

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,730
the people who are not nerds secretly

00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:06,250
admire more than anything else in the

00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:08,710
world and that's the part like ass notes

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:12,280
we tend to sort of forget that cool

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:14,890
people dig us they want to be us there

00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:18,370
won't be as more than we think and it's

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:22,150
because we do amazing stuff and we seem

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:24,820
to be happy doing it we're not great

00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:27,520
sales reps were not someone who will

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:30,040
stand in a bar in Shanghai and I sort of

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,860
smoking and pick up men or women

00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,360
depending on what you prefer and we're

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,680
not going to be the cool kids we're not

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,510
going to be that but they don't want

00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,880
that they really admire us for what we

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:42,490
do I've talked to my husband and Marco

00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,720
I've talked to friends about Marco I've

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,700
explained them in this more or less

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,460
divine sort of attitude and they go

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,410
that's amazing like there are people

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,440
working with communication and design

00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:55,150
for for the Swedish state for example

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,940
that's one of their clients who thought

00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:00,910
Marco seemed like a little mix of Jesus

00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:03,970
and Jim Morrison maybe that might be me

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:06,430
selling him to them but still that's the

00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,930
point we have to Paul the creators

00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,030
because that's what people really want

00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,890
to hear they don't want to hear a sort

00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,700
of pretending to be Steve Jobs they

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,530
don't want to hear is

00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,240
tending to be sister a movie star be

00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,310
cool will be the kid in school that we

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,470
remember from high school they don't

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,870
want that they want the nerds and we got

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,210
that so why are we focusing on this

00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:26,470
dream of a Steve Jobs personality coming

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,850
in ruling everything make everything

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,280
designing and we're going to be sleek

00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,280
and amazing and sit in the sky bar

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,920
somewhere no one wants that except the

00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:41,320
sky bar owner we need to applaud the

00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:43,900
craters we're though rubbish at this

00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:47,530
which is why I mention it but we're also

00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:51,610
kind of good ya see I'm being a little

00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:53,260
bit nice i'm no meeting you halfway we

00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:57,580
messed up in the past and we've done it

00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:59,320
in a horrible way not specifically with

00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,940
projects that we've done that's a

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,000
different story this is more or less

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:07,210
about the social thing of it because

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,750
when we get together and we get to be

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:13,270
angry nerds together then suddenly we

00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,970
tend to forget where we came from what

00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:18,670
we liked what we want to do and we bite

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:22,690
into each other it is like a high school

00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:26,410
prom there it's we can murder each other

00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:28,180
on a large scale and we've done so there

00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:31,120
are projects and people that we all know

00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,920
of that I left more or less Katie that

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,340
have sort of gone we don't care I'm

00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,660
going to do something else and we go but

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,820
in fact they've done it for a good

00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,590
reason they didn't felt welcome they

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,170
didn't feel like they're geeky and

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,790
wrists were met half way they thought

00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:50,170
that we were sort of pushing them away

00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:53,530
and I feel notice the field because I

00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:55,870
can't prove this so you know but I feel

00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:59,350
that part of this is that we tend to

00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:02,200
look for the Steve Jobs in the crowd and

00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,550
he's not there so we noticed like oh

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,230
that's a geek and he's doing geeky

00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:07,570
things but not exactly the same give you

00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,610
things that I like so I get angry at him

00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:12,100
or her if it would be a Steve Jobs

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:14,200
character standing in a crowd going blah

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,910
blah blah design is unassigned we tend

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,160
to be way more forgiving for some

00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,900
strange reason again we have to sort of

00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,060
consider the fact that we're nerds we

00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,559
like nerds we do nerdy stuff and people

00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,559
like us doing nerdy

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:29,870
instead of going wow that's nerdy and I

00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:32,750
don't really agree so boo you know push

00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:34,370
you off and we do that a lot sadly and

00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,889
we've done that a lot there are good

00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:39,500
examples of course where we've sort of

00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:42,080
been welcoming we've been friendly we've

00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:45,019
accepted people for being massive nerds

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,880
and perhaps not being the most let's say

00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:49,850
someone that you wouldn't bring to the

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,889
Nobel dinner you know like most of us

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:54,470
we're not fitting in in that sort of

00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:56,000
society and that's fine we can be really

00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,250
accepting and we can be really cool

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,919
about stuff and we can do these really

00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:06,769
cool projects likely that for example so

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,860
wow that messed up this is google by the

00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:11,929
way so don't feel bad about your bugs

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,850
okay how to get more good things and

00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:17,570
less bad things it's sort of the goal of

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:19,610
this I think that beyond the nerdiness

00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,990
obviously embracing the nerdiness these

00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:24,769
are some pointers that I wanted to

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:26,990
squeeze in do we have by the way do you

00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:31,399
have any questions from reddit we do

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:33,950
have questioned told me anything with

00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:37,250
truly can please please interrupt the

00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:39,820
truck so the first question we have

00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:43,789
which is by the most amazing user name

00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:53,529
should be unique 12 p unicorn trippy

00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:56,240
unicorn whomever you are thank you Wow

00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:57,590
well actually currently I think it's

00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,240
that I don't want to say this because

00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:03,070
she's here I'm not saying it because

00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:06,769
she's here but but Lydia and the EV is

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:09,139
extremely organized but the main problem

00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:10,700
there lies in the fact that it's easy to

00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:13,429
be organized when you're four people

00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,679
it's one a problem trying to be

00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:17,659
organized in a bag of cats trying to do

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,179
their tax return together it's not

00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:22,100
really these like its weak weak Sao

00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:24,409
Lydia is really organized and dole idia

00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,659
you sort up kitty entirely and then we

00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:29,330
put Lydia in a bag full of angry cats

00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:31,010
and ask her to sort of fix their tax

00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:33,409
return together with them it's not going

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,780
to work like that so but yes the EV I'd

00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:39,580
say is the most organized

00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:41,740
that is a good or a bad thing I mean

00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,540
like it's good yes it is absolutely good

00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,080
without them it would be a mess it would

00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,370
be a horrible mess but at the same time

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,650
we also have to consider the fact that

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:54,730
we are the ones not listening to them so

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:57,280
you know we should perhaps see what they

00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,410
want to say and try to cooperate a

00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,300
little bit more with them at times is

00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,840
any other question or that cover it are

00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:07,360
more question no cover next question is

00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,820
by riddle and he asked why would a

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,250
designer use a boring slide deck like

00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:16,090
slight egg for talk on design dynamics

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:21,400
oh I can tell you that directly I picked

00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:23,740
this for a very good reason okay this is

00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,600
the reason this is a good reason this is

00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,510
actually about the sign and it is a good

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,300
point the reason why you use dark gray

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:34,090
and gray light gray and white is that

00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,520
it's the second best way to it's a

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:38,680
second best style for visibility the

00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,320
best one would be if i replace the white

00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,690
text with bright yellow and the other

00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:51,790
one with a little bit more faded yellow

00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:55,210
I'm doing this for you wonderful thank

00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:58,030
you how dare you also that's a sign of

00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:00,010
it so it's the any other question that

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,440
there's one last question okay go for it

00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:11,080
go for a cover can you imagine a stack

00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:14,260
exchange for UI designers I can but it

00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,850
would be I mean if it's a social okay so

00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,870
the problem why I call myself

00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:21,610
illustrated before designer is because I

00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,170
like illustrators illustrators are cool

00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,450
and friendly to each other we tend to be

00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:27,220
supportive of each other's work we tend

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,290
to be very much like if you want to show

00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,480
your taste in something you say oh I

00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,800
like that decide that illustrator and

00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,230
that illustrator in that illustrator

00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,700
with designers the opposite tend to be

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,410
true i'm not saying all the signers but

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,740
a certain class of designer tend to be I

00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:44,130
hate that that's rubbish you suck that

00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,950
tends to be the way they show how much

00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:49,220
style they have

00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:51,649
something and that's why I think a stack

00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:56,000
exchange for UI designers will end in

00:32:51,649 --> 00:33:04,220
World War free i I don't know I wouldn't

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:08,870
yes that was your question okay oh oh we

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:12,080
have mics yeah so what I meant is you

00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:13,909
said that you cannot go to the

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,980
programmers and tell you and tell them

00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:20,950
do it this way yeah because they will

00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:25,070
leave but yeah I suck at UI design Oh

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:30,080
badly well and I've given up on it I

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:32,419
work on back ends now and I think it

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,039
would be nice to have it the other way

00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:35,929
around so you know you don't come to

00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:38,380
people and tell them what to do but they

00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:41,630
come to you and tell me what and yet ask

00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:44,600
look at my UI why does it suck so bad

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:47,480
what did I do wrong what can I do better

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,600
yeah that is a good point I think

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,730
actually that it should be more of

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,490
programmers and developers coming to

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:57,950
designers going you there do design for

00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,360
me because that would be way better than

00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,100
is currently I mean it's tricky right

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,779
now because everything is very much up

00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,970
in the air but I agree there should be

00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:07,580
some way of us doing that there's one

00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:09,369
and that the only one that we have

00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,450
currently is more or less a social thing

00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:13,190
because I mean I don't know you that

00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:16,099
well and you don't know me I think we

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,899
met once here I've seen you or maybe I'm

00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,540
going I don't have glasses on nevermind

00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:23,480
no no I have never seen you before in my

00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,520
life but yeah that sort of means that

00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,159
you can't go up to me and go hey hey hey

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,599
yes I want you to do this for me that

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,310
that's not going to happen but you

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,260
should be able to like if you're in KDE

00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:36,260
you should obviously be able to just go

00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,419
yams dance come on chop-chop do you know

00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,669
click 'ok Lackey or joy joy do it now

00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:42,470
some of here i know personally and

00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:45,319
they're more than happy to do that and I

00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:47,899
also know that I'm i love that I love

00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:49,639
that because I'm not gonna it's a social

00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:53,679
thing as well because I can't go in to

00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:56,950
go to you and go you you I is horrible

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,300
what did you do why are you here that's

00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:01,000
that's a horrible thing to say to

00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,819
someone so it's way better that you sort

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,690
of go to me but then we're sort of both

00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:09,490
sitting on each of our chairs instead of

00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:13,210
is real you need some kind of social

00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:14,940
go-between yeah sit down and we can say

00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,140
hey I'm a developer you're a developer I

00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,670
think you're you i could be better maybe

00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,650
you should go to yen's you know that

00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:23,349
yeah we should be strict feel that kind

00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,089
of bridges no but but it's yeah that's

00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:27,069
true on one hand on the other we could

00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:31,300
sort of skip the bridge entirely and

00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:32,530
sort of be more outward with it well I'm

00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,990
telling you all of you not right now

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,540
that it's okay to poke me I'll say no if

00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:39,460
I don't have time but you know it's

00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,410
wonderful to poke me and I know a lot of

00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,380
a lot of other designers that Ike always

00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:47,380
sort of shuffle the work on words tu

00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:49,390
sabes for example it's a Brit of someone

00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,450
who sort of skip ahead of the bridge

00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,710
because he recently went to me before I

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,900
went to stalk him and went away

00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:59,619
obviously so it's not not much work had

00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,540
been done sorry service sorry oh don't

00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:03,640
beat me up but he knows that he can just

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:07,299
go and grab me and say yes you got to do

00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:10,450
this and I will and I hope that at some

00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:13,000
point we get where everyone all

00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:14,829
developers feel that I get to go and

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,140
talk to a designer as if he's my best

00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:24,700
friend we known each other forever what

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:26,940
oh you're creating a fight are you reach

00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:30,099
outside interesting aside on that

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,680
yesterday we I talked with see people

00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:35,200
who this is about the multiscreen

00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:38,319
configuration user interface which I

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:43,569
just put in the capable hands of the

00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:46,540
visual design group for a redesign and

00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:49,630
yesterday I talked to the original

00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:52,119
developers with it and said yeah you

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,730
know I actually want to redo this stuff

00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:58,750
of the UI and I may have used the word

00:36:54,730 --> 00:37:03,250
rewrite and he said yeah you do that

00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:06,190
I've done it four times and you can do a

00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,890
fifth time no problem at all so what

00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,170
what

00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:13,819
more often than not if you go to someone

00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:17,450
and you say your UI sucks is that this

00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:20,390
personally yeah you're right you but

00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:23,559
that's still okay call me a bleeding

00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:26,690
heart but I don't want to insult the man

00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:30,529
I think Mike a completely wrong way to

00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:32,750
go about it so let's improve it can I

00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:40,720
just restart my computer and hope for

00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:40,720
the best I started a new session whoo

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:50,420
nothing oh my god I start a new session

00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:57,220
that's a weird thing who made this UI oh

00:37:50,420 --> 00:38:01,640
shut no one talks about that anymore Oh

00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:05,569
is he is he oh I'll take him down okay

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,380
so how to get to refocus how to get more

00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:11,660
fing good things and less bad things and

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,730
it's well this is a list so we're going

00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,019
to just read along shall we accept that

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,029
people are people won't be at our level

00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:19,099
of excitement yet this is actually ok so

00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:21,769
this is one of the things that I get

00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:23,690
really hyped up about is our tendency to

00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:25,220
hope that new people are going to be an

00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,809
hour level of excitement they're going

00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,910
to be sort of like yeah I'm going to do

00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:30,799
bug reports and that's not gonna happen

00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:33,680
I mean we don't go yeah i'm going to do

00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:35,809
bug reports that's not what we are but

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,210
we have sort of been excited enough to

00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:39,680
feel like I can do this I can do bug

00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,119
reports are going to do bug trashing I

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,079
can shake things it's going to be fine

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:48,859
we can't accept expect people to be that

00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,119
level of excitement yet focus on

00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,799
inspiring people to work instead of

00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,200
complaining or ordering again I've been

00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:55,789
talking about this the entire thing

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,310
you're shaking your watch by the way how

00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:02,640
long do we have we're fine

00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,990
whoo okay and then focus on inspiring

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,350
people to work instead of complaining an

00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:09,300
ordering that gives itself talk more

00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,790
about the people who make I mentioned

00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,340
that before talk more about let's let's

00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:18,180
talk more about Marco for example if we

00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:20,190
want to III do or talk more about other

00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:23,310
people who make cool things and do it in

00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:26,100
a way that sort of inspires others like

00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:28,380
us like don't try to inspire someone who

00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,990
doesn't know anything or it has no

00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,110
interest in nerdy stuff because they're

00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,670
not going to be interested anyway allow

00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:37,560
yourself to geek out when you talk about

00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,420
things allow yourself to be a little bit

00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,930
technical but be friendly about it still

00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:45,030
there's that sort of gray area which we

00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,610
always miss we always tend to be either

00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:50,310
extremely glitzy and you a sort of PR

00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:51,930
like or we tend to be very focused on

00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:55,920
the extremely technical and both of them

00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:59,340
can be bad one of them can be less bad I

00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,770
don't let's move along criticism is

00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,740
ninety percent compliments I've spell

00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:07,790
that wrong I think criticism is Nigerian

00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:10,440
compliments and this is a thing that I

00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:13,440
this goes together with a social social

00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,870
bit right it's that we when we criticize

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,120
we tend to forget that a criticism a

00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:20,970
good criticism is ninety percent being

00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,740
nice like if I want to criticize your

00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,780
t-shirt for example I was starting wanna

00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,220
you know you look happy today and then

00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,690
blah blah blah blah blah and then said

00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:32,970
perhaps you should switch t-shirts

00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:35,850
because Wow and the reason is it's that

00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,980
it's the friendly sandwich of insults

00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:40,370
more or less it's that sort of you want

00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,320
the person the reason for that is that

00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:45,480
criticism which doesn't isn't met with

00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,420
compliments as well as embedded in

00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:52,380
compliments we tend to forget that

00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,870
criticism do hurt that your UI sucks for

00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,090
example you might think on a logical

00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:59,250
plane that oh yeah okay it does suck but

00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:00,780
you know you'll help me now and you're

00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,880
just saying the truth and blah blah blah

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,820
blah blah that's not not how people

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,650
usually work it's a weird thing to say

00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,690
to a room nurse that's not how people

00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:14,010
work dammit no it's

00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:16,320
I were aliens no it's the fact that we

00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:18,960
tend to get a little bit hurt and if I

00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,940
tell you ten times that your UI sucks

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,640
you'll never try to do you I again and

00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:26,130
that's you know convenient in some ways

00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,260
for me because I get to DUI stuff but on

00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:30,780
the other hand it's still bad because

00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,850
that means you'll never try it and we

00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,980
want people to try stuff like I said

00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:37,890
better a magnificent failure than a

00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:40,100
mediocre success make your UI so bad

00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:43,320
that people will write about it like oh

00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:47,610
Jesus I got a heartburn from watching

00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,590
that you I then inspire through action

00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:51,420
and creations their words this is sort

00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:54,630
of self-explanatory we all know that is

00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,640
that me saying this nonsense up here

00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:58,650
it's not going to make you people do

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,630
something different what what will

00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:04,020
inspire though if I do something that is

00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:05,820
so majestically messed up or sort of

00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,700
vomit you know like i said vomit fallen

00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,550
state law that might inspire the action

00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,110
is a way better way to inspire someone

00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,760
else that sounds like I'm trying to

00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:16,380
inspire you to get a panic attack i'm

00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,750
not but what I'm saying is that you can

00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,820
inspired by good UI you watch a cool UI

00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:24,960
let's say I'm done because i only do

00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:27,360
cool UI and you see that oh that's

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,270
that's amazing and then I you and me

00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,530
start talking about doing our new UI for

00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,730
the thing that you made and we start

00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:34,710
talking about like what queer you ooh

00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:36,090
and I show you this thing and I show you

00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:39,450
that thing and we start talking then

00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:42,360
suddenly work happens me saying just

00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:43,950
saying do better UI it's not going to

00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,940
work it's not going to cut it it's not

00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:47,100
going to make people better

00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,200
automatically but we want to inspire for

00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,580
action creations their words and you

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,470
guys who are programmers you can do this

00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,570
way better than me because you do cool

00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:56,400
things and other people see the cool

00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,990
things and say I want to do this cool

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,350
thing and perhaps they're rubbish at it

00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:03,180
but that's another thing then we have

00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:04,770
the accept descent applauded but learn

00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,910
how to deal with further i'm going to

00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:10,760
children hammer through these points

00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:13,710
fairly quick i notice and that is when

00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,410
when anyone in this crowd goes i hate

00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:17,970
this or at least say I don't like this

00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,440
we have to accept that in a better way

00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,180
because we haven't been good at it we

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,490
tend to drive people away we tend to

00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:27,810
fight in

00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:29,430
these insane battles about nonsense to

00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,020
be quite frank from the outside it's

00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:34,050
often one of those why don't they just

00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:35,520
go there you're okay and then go away

00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:38,010
because that's what you're arguing often

00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,660
it's very not just technical but its

00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:41,670
technical combined with pride and we

00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,500
tend to be get really angry and spike

00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,510
about descent but people don't agree

00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,980
with us and we have to sort of applaud

00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,540
it we have to applaud ascent and make

00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,850
sure that people can do their own stuff

00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,040
without ruining it for everyone else and

00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:55,170
we also have to notice how to deal with

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,360
it properly how to include people who

00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:59,820
wants to do different things so they can

00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,619
test doing their thing in KD instead of

00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,650
being kicked out of ke and trying it on

00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:06,030
their own they have to test it in KDE we

00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:09,150
have to go like well it's not for

00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:10,860
everyone but that's awesome I'll help

00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:14,460
out and can we evolve it somewhere else

00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:16,110
because that way if it goes great and we

00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,390
notice it's better than what we have

00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:21,240
then we can include them to what we have

00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:23,580
if it's horrible that person will

00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,950
probably go it wasn't that bad and we

00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,540
still work together because currently

00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,430
we're sort of shoving people out at

00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,430
times when we feel they're a little bit

00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:33,690
too different spot the difference

00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:35,550
between an Islander make the device it

00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,990
fistfight it should be see I don't know

00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,820
why I have to write that down or why I

00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:41,160
wrote it down to the quad honest but

00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,660
it's it's it's a difference like I don't

00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,880
like his t-shirt he doesn't like my

00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,109
shirt that's a debate maybe and then

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,230
when he goes I don't like your face

00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:50,820
that's when we know it's is it like when

00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,740
a conversation is technical on our

00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,540
mailing list we know all it's still fine

00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,400
it's when people start to repeat

00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,619
themselves we've all sinned it seeing it

00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,160
the beginning of the flame war we can

00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:03,750
spot it a mile away in text I noticed in

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,090
social situations we're not as good but

00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:08,430
you know let's all talk about that we

00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,320
need to be better at this we need to be

00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,030
better at stepping in and going ok now

00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,760
we have to sort of this is a timeout

00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:16,619
thing try to let's leave it for a week

00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,630
and come back and talk about it later we

00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:22,650
need to be comfortable enough to do this

00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:25,350
as a group as everyone like and we have

00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:28,920
to listen when someone goes to you for

00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:30,600
example and goes no no no no we have to

00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,760
step away for a week will become back

00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,460
because you're way too angry the natural

00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,710
reaction is going no I'm not

00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,000
because that's what we are we don't like

00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:40,320
to being told that we're angry and we

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,990
don't get to do what we want because

00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:50,250
we're Katie and I can show you the in

00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:51,480
there we are we r KD yay and this is

00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,340
what we do when people tell us what to

00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,980
do we don't like it that's what everyone

00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:58,530
does the thing is we have to learn to

00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,720
sort of grow up about this specific

00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:02,010
thing we have to learn to grow up to

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,380
understand when someone tell us

00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,150
something in a public way they are

00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,090
actually trying to be nice they're not

00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:10,590
saying you're a horrible person then I'm

00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:13,080
saying I'm a horrible person they're

00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:15,180
saying look I get it you're a great

00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,670
person but right now with this is

00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,560
heading into a minefield and we don't do

00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:21,360
this at all we have to be better off

00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,820
that's part of the social glue that's

00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,650
needed to have this sort of social here

00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,480
key last thing that we got going which

00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:31,190
is lovely but it's also sort of

00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,570
collapsing a little bit at times

00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,430
collaboration is key with whomever and

00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:38,100
this is one of those things that were

00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:39,720
also not that good at we tend to ignore

00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,520
the fact that there's a lot of people

00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:45,420
who want to collaborate with us there's

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:48,870
a brilliant example there was a design

00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,370
do that I worked for years back who who

00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,350
might have been the street and he said

00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:54,030
oh you know programmers yeah yeah I know

00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:57,840
a lot of programmers they're lovely

00:46:54,030 --> 00:47:01,260
people I said that's as far as you know

00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:04,500
at least and he mentioned that like

00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:07,590
we're doing this thing with their cold

00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:10,050
strawberry pies and human raspberry PI's

00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:12,360
yeah and there's guys there's gonna send

00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:14,610
sort of information on a thing and I

00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,580
went like okay that's that's cool but

00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:19,920
you know what are you talking about and

00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:22,380
he sort of mumbled about doing some sort

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,660
of Wi-Fi router thing and he'd love to

00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,310
work with us I mean that's the problem

00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,930
is of course they don't have cash now

00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,970
which is the typical thing they don't

00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,590
have cash now but the thing is that all

00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,540
these collaborative projects are out

00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:35,660
there they might sound stupid to us

00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:38,640
because the person presenting it is a

00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:41,100
not a thick go but not a nerd you know

00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,820
like it raspberry strawberry pies and

00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:46,580
everything it's they don't get it or

00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:49,140
they don't get what they're doing at all

00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,500
but we have to consider collaboration

00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,180
more

00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,010
have to be better at it we have to be

00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,720
better to collaborate with anyone if

00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:56,760
there's a company come along saying I

00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,270
want to do this we need to look at the

00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:02,100
company as an ally and then see at what

00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,830
they're trying to do as a problem like

00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,090
we can't go your company I don't like

00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:07,650
you I'm never going to work with you

00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,480
ever because your company we have to

00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,710
look at what do you really want what do

00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,780
we get out today it's stuff like that

00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:16,830
but we have to consider collaboration

00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:19,410
add more important key and then lastly

00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:21,570
never go to bed angry which is something

00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,910
that helped me my parents my

00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:27,120
grandparents etc many others parents and

00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:29,940
themselves in any relationship and this

00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:32,100
actually makes sense to us because we

00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,110
tend to do this we tend to be the bad

00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,240
couple the couple that fight through the

00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,100
night and then sort of sleep back to

00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,080
back and sort of mutters swear words to

00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:43,130
each other or just jab each other in the

00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:47,250
ribs if we can we tend to hold a grudge

00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:50,460
way too long we tend to sort of go to

00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:55,770
know their ass hats or sorry there boo

00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:58,320
heads yes I'm fine day for Sweden i

00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:01,620
can't stop swearing their poo heads and

00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:04,470
we sort of looking normal orrible people

00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:07,470
and in fact they're lovely like but we

00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:10,110
tend to hold a grudge like let's let's

00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:12,330
be angry at them for a relevant reason

00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,980
instead of sort of just being angry at

00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:16,410
them all the time we're really good at

00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:22,830
being angry all the time and keeping it

00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:25,940
going and final ready check yeah there

00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:29,580
are more comments and questions okay um

00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:32,250
the first one hello yen's great talk

00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:34,940
from the wiki to learn guys near the

00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,940
bottom of the room

00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:45,859
thank you yeah you haven't boot enough

00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:49,460
criticism and all we do us have you

00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:54,740
finished a logo yet yeah I have but you

00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:57,320
rejected it of where are you I have you

00:49:54,740 --> 00:50:01,310
there you are I have you rejected it but

00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:03,710
I can't see oh there you are I was

00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:06,349
looking up there I have you rejected it

00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:08,030
it was to remain in you said and I

00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:10,640
realized I know nothing about Romania

00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:12,740
let's talk about it this inning perhaps

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,040
we can sketch it up that's gonna be fine

00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:17,510
it's gonna be cool next question so I

00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:22,190
sort of skipped the head like I haven't

00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:25,700
done it sorry I the next one is again by

00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:28,609
trippy unicorn and they ask is neon

00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:30,740
ready for work you're asking the

00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:33,230
designer if jnanis ready for work I'm

00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:35,359
gonna say well the salesman I answered

00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,680
it was of course it's ready for work

00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:42,070
that's just the question of how

00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:42,070
professional you are like

00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:54,300
but the nerdy the nerdy answer is yeah

00:50:50,869 --> 00:50:57,359
maybe there are there are bugs there are

00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,380
problems there are stuff etc but I don't

00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,450
want to be the guy who answer that

00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,180
because I don't want to be in any way

00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:05,220
and I want to be responsible in some

00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:07,950
ways for it like I want to be one of the

00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:09,839
people you can fling crap at if it's

00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,250
something doesn't work but I want I

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,079
don't want to be the person who take

00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:15,210
credit for it because I haven't done

00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:18,060
much on it it should again be the

00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:20,099
developers and they do master again I'm

00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:22,680
sliding into salesman boys here but

00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:25,200
they've got a massive job to improve

00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,190
something that was shake it first and

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,369
then got better and better and better

00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:32,609
but yes I think so i use it daily this

00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:40,740
is my arch machine by the way so my my

00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:42,690
my desktop computer is stable how would

00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:46,050
click beat me up if I said anything else

00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:50,310
yeah it's stable rock steady next

00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:52,500
quickly a little slower us angry nerds

00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:54,420
tend to not be very nice and sometimes

00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:58,250
hurt people what do you or the audience

00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:01,650
propose i would like to look at okay so

00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:06,000
okay this is actually a really relevant

00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:09,119
question angry nurse we tend to be a

00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,589
little bit the correct term is on the

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,810
autism spectrum there's a lot of people

00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:14,700
on the autism spectrum in our midst

00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:17,609
that's just the fact i don't know why

00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:20,310
that is why they find us a safer and

00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:22,770
nicer place to be in i mean i know i

00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:24,750
have a lot like that where phobia I like

00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:27,589
this place I mean the reason I'm up here

00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:30,210
even talking is because she asked me and

00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:35,220
agoraphobic to do a keynote what I ate

00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:37,170
what a wonderful person Alex for example

00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,359
had borrowed me his Fitbit so we can

00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:41,400
measure my heart beats if people like

00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,450
all these people have given me so it's

00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,829
going to be fine it's going to be fine

00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:48,660
and if you vomit our film ate like the

00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:50,099
point is we're a little bit weird but we

00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,540
are welcoming and one of the things that

00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:54,150
we have to remember with people who tend

00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:55,859
to be a little bit too spiky is an

00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:58,529
if they have are on the autism spectrum

00:52:55,859 --> 00:53:01,619
we have to consider who they are first

00:52:58,529 --> 00:53:04,470
and really think does this person really

00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:06,029
try to make me angry or is it just a

00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:07,980
sort of a bit of a full part we try we

00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:11,369
have to meet them halfway most of the

00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:14,940
most of the angry nerds I met that has

00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:18,029
tried to hurt me has been it's been like

00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:20,640
being attacked by kitten like I'm a gay

00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:24,260
male aged man I've been insulted way

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:29,400
worse by other gay guys we're good at it

00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:32,430
but so the point is that that but when

00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,839
when theyíve some ugly nerds when you

00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:36,210
just want to tell you something like I

00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,099
didn't like the UI you made they tend to

00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:40,349
be very sort of i'm going to be very

00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:41,970
logical and clear about this and then

00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:44,579
they say something that's really hurtful

00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:47,339
and you realize you have to realize that

00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:50,039
he's not or she's not trying to be mean

00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:51,960
she's here she is trying to just be

00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:55,230
logical and clear and you have to accept

00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,670
this but yeah there's there's a five

00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:58,770
people in here that I've wanted to

00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:01,140
strangle at one time or another until

00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:03,930
someone else was long he's just trying

00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:06,000
to be nice don't worry about it oh okay

00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:08,910
there's one specific who's in Korea

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,140
right now I kid who's a lovely human

00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:14,849
being but he is why im a swedish nerd

00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:17,640
he's in german art and cultural clashes

00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:18,960
happen and one of the things we started

00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,789
out when we started talking one of the

00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,440
first time you started talking i told

00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:25,200
him i never want to talk to you ever

00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,970
again you are literally the worst and he

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,940
said I don't want to work with you ever

00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:32,010
again goodbye that was our more or less

00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,420
our first conversation and then we

00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:36,210
should have patched it up because we

00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:38,730
realized we were arguing arguing on

00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:40,740
assumptions that we made about the other

00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:42,779
person and what he was trying to say i

00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:45,630
was making assumptions about ikea and

00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:47,250
sort of weaving in sub context into what

00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:50,010
he was saying into this massively

00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:52,140
melodramatic insult and he was consumed

00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:54,180
like talking to me and thinking I was

00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:56,430
the most ungrateful person in the world

00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,799
because I I said I was flippant about

00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:01,260
his suggestions he tried to help and I

00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:03,030
saw it and insults and then he saw me

00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,550
being okay

00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:07,410
I is trying to get away as me being the

00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:09,180
most insulting person ever but we

00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,440
managed to patch it up and that's what

00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,090
we've got to do we still have to meet

00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,550
halfway we have to see what the person

00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:16,800
are who the person is and how to sort of

00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:19,020
interact the best way possible and if

00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,610
there's someone who's truly mean to you

00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,290
this is what you put should have been

00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:25,110
told in school if there's someone truly

00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:27,090
mean to you stop talking to them walk

00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,680
away if they don't get that you're

00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:31,050
walking away because you don't like them

00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:33,120
then they're a bit thick and need help

00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,740
from other friends but you need to walk

00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,260
away and just drop it but I don't think

00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:39,480
there's that many like there are a few

00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:41,130
that might be like that but I think most

00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,770
of the time we're just overreacting to

00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:45,660
assumptions any other questions we are

00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:49,080
five minutes one more comment in one

00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:51,150
more question first one from Yvonne who

00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:57,600
says I'm glad you're a part of our

00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:59,400
little world oh and then adorable by the

00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:03,150
way he's somewhere here I can't see him

00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:06,960
and it's the like o kz that there is he

00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:10,350
is adorable he's calmed in on that the

00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,580
angry nerd thing again even this is

00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:15,240
going to sound a little bit cruel even

00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:18,600
I'm sorry even it's a really sort of

00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:22,200
like Yammer sort of wow why am I doing

00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:24,330
this I'm a very sort of sort of logical

00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,860
kind of person and he wants to sort of

00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:28,050
do the logical thing and other people

00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:30,390
might I know some people who read his

00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:34,410
comments on my Google+ for example like

00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:36,240
who is this poophead I'm keeping to who

00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:38,340
is this idiot like like what's wrong

00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:42,540
with this person and I go no no no no no

00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:44,430
it's even he's the greatest he's the

00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,770
first is also the first kiddie developer

00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:48,300
I've ever met ever on a street in

00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:50,430
Barcelona but the thing is like I know

00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:54,360
Eva because we're friends and even

00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:56,100
hopefully knows me that he can there's a

00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,560
way that we can talk to each other that

00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:01,110
that I'm sure that he knows that he's

00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,550
not hurting me and I know that he's not

00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:04,650
trying to so it's sort of like one of

00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:06,480
those we all have weird personality so

00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:08,340
I'll ensure you most of you find me sort

00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,080
of loud and obnoxious but no though

00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:13,650
that's the nccs trying to be friendly

00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,690
and we get by on it sorry next next

00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:17,720
thing and even

00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:20,750
normal again I would ask what do you do

00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:25,000
if it's bad time and you are angry one

00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:25,000
when it's bad time and you are angry

00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:35,690
that's that's the answer more or less

00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:39,010
yeah serve us knows we have a code of

00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:39,010
conduct here so I can't comment

00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:48,410
especially that's the correct answer no

00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:50,990
but I I never get angry except when I'm

00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:53,420
really angry and then just nevermind

00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,770
let's just leave that stressfully is

00:57:53,420 --> 00:58:01,790
there any other questions from this

00:57:54,770 --> 00:58:06,079
lovely group of people yes I love that

00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:08,060
you said that we should fail and just as

00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:11,780
more common in there once we were in a

00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:13,880
bar like for TV developers talking and

00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,650
talking about our most favorite topic

00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,960
the vision and the mission and all that

00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:21,109
mm-hmm and we actually came out with a

00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:23,119
vision that GD should be a safe place to

00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:27,040
fail yeah that should be part of us and

00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:29,599
it's nice to come and many of us learn

00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,250
almost everything women we know here and

00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,290
you can fail and that's nice because

00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:34,970
you're surrounded with good people and

00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:37,760
they're just going to have you whenever

00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:41,030
you do something bad Kerry and that's

00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,440
really nice and but with these theories

00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:45,319
accountant part sometimes is that

00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:48,290
although we are nerds and I agree with

00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:50,510
that sometimes is not even about looking

00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:53,450
for the coke it sometimes is up is this

00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:55,550
about competing with between nerds right

00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:58,069
yeah so you have the other cool project

00:58:55,550 --> 00:58:59,540
in some other github or whatever that

00:58:58,069 --> 00:59:01,940
they are really cool they're doing

00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:04,520
latest and they are not failing while

00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:06,950
all you can see is failure and that

00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:08,930
sometimes can bring you down to motivate

00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:13,060
and then do the motivate others and then

00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:16,430
you become a depressing community so Wow

00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:18,770
well this is negative negativity is easy

00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:20,510
to spread right so how absolutely how do

00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:22,970
we keep it up like how do we avoid the

00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:25,010
negativity and thoughts on on that I I

00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:27,470
think that that first of all I think

00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:28,610
it's not as possible that we're going to

00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:32,020
fail mr.

00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:37,610
all the time but I do think that we I

00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:39,110
don't we've see a there but I don't like

00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:41,030
there are a lot of things that we've

00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:42,770
dealt with badly and we've dealt with it

00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:44,960
by not talking about it we dealt with it

00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:47,120
by not appalling that person and going

00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,940
that was a good try but we sort of focus

00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:51,860
on the bad things I feel when it comes

00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,990
to our own projects we tend to be more

00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:55,790
critical that we should we tend to not

00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:57,320
applaud that person again it's a social

00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:59,480
thing more than anything else and I

00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,760
think that if you fail if I'm fail

00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,550
miserably right now that's okay so in

01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,560
this example more than anything I have a

01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:08,170
panic attack I vomit I fall off the

01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,700
stage you drive into the hospital my

01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:12,860
reaction would be horrible embarrassment

01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:15,290
that when I woke up but I still know

01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:17,360
that I'm sorta be welcome in and I'd get

01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:18,710
jabs and pokes and people laughing and

01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,890
then I get suggestion on how to deal

01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:26,450
with it the next time where for example

01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:29,450
suggests dumb suggestions and we can

01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:31,790
keep that up that's the thing like I if

01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:33,230
I don't know the thing is I don't know

01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:35,660
of any grand failures that we're done I

01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:37,370
know some but not all and I'd love to

01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,110
know more about them just to talk more

01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:40,490
about them and now apparently I'm

01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:42,710
running out of time really quickly yes

01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:44,870
i'm going to talk one more question

01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:48,110
sorry Alex we'll talk about it more

01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:50,500
because we really should that's so do

01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:53,960
you think Katie 40 or something good I

01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:58,610
was this is the best answer i wasn't in

01:00:53,960 --> 01:01:01,270
linux dead suckers I don't have to even

01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,270
a hamster

01:01:05,309 --> 01:01:10,599
but but in support of my friends yes

01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,089
absolutely like if someone if someone

01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:15,190
from the outside said do you think Katie

01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:17,140
like no that's wrong if someone from the

01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:18,609
outside said in a very sort of do you

01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:22,000
really think Katie for was a good idea

01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:24,279
I'd say yes I do a blood of on that

01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,730
thing I go yeah it was the best idea

01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:29,619
ever because we kind of have to do that

01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:31,150
for each other as well like we have to

01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:33,250
support each other in some sort of weird

01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:35,769
way I know it's not logically not clear

01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:37,539
and it's not even it doesn't really make

01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:39,670
sense either but we have to be there for

01:01:37,539 --> 01:01:41,559
each other if for example someone

01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:44,349
criticize Quinn and you're standing next

01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:46,269
to me I would go Quinn is the best it

01:01:44,349 --> 01:01:48,549
has no bugs there's no problem we're

01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:50,380
already running on Wayland and we can

01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:51,849
eject ourselves into space with it I'm

01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,980
ready to lie cheat and steal for each

01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:55,990
other and we should we shouldn't feel

01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:57,789
like we we can support each other we

01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:59,890
need more back slaps we need more people

01:01:57,789 --> 01:02:02,470
going you are you are the bomb or

01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:06,039
whatever kids see who they say just

01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:07,509
realized i am almost 40 I I don't know

01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:09,759
how to say these things and now we have

01:02:07,509 --> 01:02:11,349
to wrap it up and I want to thank you

hospital and can I just just for the

01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:18,640
record since we're still filming I just
