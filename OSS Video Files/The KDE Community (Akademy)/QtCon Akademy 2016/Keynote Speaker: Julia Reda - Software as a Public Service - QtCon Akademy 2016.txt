Title: Keynote Speaker: Julia Reda - Software as a Public Service - QtCon Akademy 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: QtCon Akademy 2016
Description: 
	The FOSSA project to get the European Union to run open source security audits takes a step towards understanding FLOSS as a public service: If free/libre open source software belongs to the public, the public needs to take responsibility for it. Taking such responsibility – and not just
for security – is getting more and more urgent as software controls ever more of the world around us. Societies need to ask themselves: Can people be truly emancipated and governments truly independent when they cannot (or just do not) inspect and modify the code that runs their lives?

I am happy to introduce our last keynote

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,509
speaker yoga radon she's member of the

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:20,160
European Parliament for the pirate party

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:23,570
since 2014 she has a legislative focus

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,900
on copyright and Internet policy issues

00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:30,420
she was therefore responsible for the

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,680
parliaments evaluation of the copyright

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:38,070
reform which was very well received

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,760
today she talks about free software and

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,489
public administration she says if the

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,180
code is public the public also has a

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:51,000
responsibility she will talk about how

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,000
and why public administrations should

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,670
care and promote free software should

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,640
also care about the code and about its

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,640
security please welcome you Loretta

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,260
thank you thank you very much I want to

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,119
talk about the relationship between free

00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,119
and open source software and government

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,880
being a politician not a very surprising

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,070
topic but from what I heard it is a

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,000
topic that has resonated with quite a

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,000
lot of the talks this weekend and it's

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,549
certainly a topic of a lot of interest

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,259
whether and how governments and public

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,720
administrations are using free software

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,030
and there are also lots of good

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,179
arguments about that that we've heard

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,250
about how free and open source software

00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:49,860
can make you more independent from a

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,210
specific vendor it can help the

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:57,030
administration's to adapt to new tasks

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,100
and of course it can also save costs but

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,409
these are all different arguments that I

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,350
don't want to go into so much in this

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,229
talk what I do want to talk about more

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,600
fundamentally is what is the government

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,560
and what does that have to do with free

00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,480
software on a very fundamental level at

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,530
least the ideal is that government is

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,720
all of us it should serve everybody and

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,480
it should be accountable to everybody

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,690
and one very important function that

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,730
even the most critical people of

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,290
governments recognize what a government

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,510
does is that it provides infrastructure

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,640
so it makes sure that there are streets

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,140
it makes sure that there are cables in

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,000
the ground perhaps it doesn't actually

00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,640
run the internet and telephone services

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,049
but at least it makes sure that they are

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,180
available and safe to use but we can

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,340
argue that for civic software for

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,440
software that is used by the government

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,450
especially in the interaction with the

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,140
public that this is also a public

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,760
service and the only software philosophy

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,950
that would really make sense for a

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,910
government that takes its accountability

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,730
to the public seriously is that it uses

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,470
it takes responsibility for and it also

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:15,090
contributes to free and open source

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:17,010
software I think that this task making

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,230
sure that government uses free and open

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,629
source software is today more urgent

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,200
than ever that's because of two

00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:25,060
different distinct

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,060
developments in society and technology

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,190
that together can become quite dangerous

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,930
the one is the importance of technology

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:37,780
in society the other is the what I call

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,310
losing the freedom to tinker the

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,459
combination of these two developments

00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:46,030
means that technological project

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:48,069
progress can lead not to again in

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,500
autonomy like we have all hoped but to a

00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:52,540
loss in autonomy of the people that the

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,810
great promise of autonomy that it will

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,700
empower everybody that the free and open

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,930
source software community also stands

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:04,180
for is at stake so if we lose this fight

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,340
the technology can become a tool just

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,780
for the powerful in society and not for

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,519
everybody so I've chosen a rather

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,220
provocative term for the role of

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,620
software in society that algorithms rule

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,900
the world you've probably read this in

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,729
newspapers usually in kind of a context

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,010
where they say that software somehow

00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:26,830
magic and only very few people know

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,900
what's happening and we're all slaves to

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,240
to those new software magicians this is

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,560
not what I'm talking about and it's also

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,820
not to be understood in the sense of

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,669
some politicians who are basically

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,789
saying let's ban all technology but I

00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:44,320
mean this more in the sense that

00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:46,630
computers are no longer limited to

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,430
particular parts of our lives but rather

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,430
that they are an integral part of the

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,740
physical world so the best example of

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,930
that I guess is that nobody really talks

00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:00,430
about real life anymore when they mean

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:03,070
offline um I've come across this

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,470
development the importance of software

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,139
in several sometimes rather unexpected

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,479
parts of my work and one that was most

00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:12,039
revealing to me was my work in the

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,870
inquiry committee on the so called

00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:17,500
diesel gate the diesel exhaust fumes

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,990
scandal this is not just a scandal where

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,440
government turned a blind eye to obvious

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,330
fraud by powerful companies it's also a

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,060
scandal that is based on the fact that

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,190
cars are computers on wheels and our

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:34,479
legislation is not adapted to this

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:37,090
reality the defeat devices that is the

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,600
cheat codes inside the car

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,550
it can be completely software-based and

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,010
actually in the process for allowing a

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,840
car to go on the road there is no check

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,790
even to make sure whether the software

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,979
run on the car that is tested is

00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:54,220
actually the same as the software that

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:57,040
is sold to customers so even if the car

00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:00,910
that is tested in the laboratory is

00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,160
completely safe does not have two high

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,669
emissions if it's the software alone

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,729
that can influence this our tests are

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:11,950
complete completely inadequate for

00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:14,669
actually testing whether the cars on the

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,930
road are safe because from from a purely

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:19,330
computer point of view they could be

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,380
completely different devices simply

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,870
because they're running completely

00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,389
different software another interesting

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,550
aspect of this is that defeat devices

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:32,080
can actually be legal in a very small

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,169
exception and that is if it's necessary

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,850
to protect the engine from damage and

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,340
unfortunately there is actually no

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,470
requirement in the law that a car maker

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,780
who uses such a defeat device that is

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,700
switching off the NOx abatement

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,030
technology simply to save the engine

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,070
that they don't have to disclose this to

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,500
the regulators in any way that means

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,990
they don't have to explode expose the

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,479
source code not even to the regulators

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,970
and they don't have to explain what the

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,550
software on the car actually does what

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,849
this means in practice and this is a

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:10,080
slide from the CCC talk given by Felix

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:13,479
danke and Daniel anger this year is that

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,010
in the case of felix don't because VW

00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,340
car there was actually a function

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:21,190
programmed into the car that was

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,620
switching off the NOx abatement

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,080
technology whenever the distance driven

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,240
by the car was deviating significantly

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,580
from the test procedure that was written

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,710
into the law so in order to find this

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,500
out I mean this is a very obvious fraud

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,750
of course but in order to find this out

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,380
Felix domki actually had to reverse

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,060
engineer the software on his own car and

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,729
of course it would make a lot more sense

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,880
if a car manufacturer actually had to

00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:54,000
disclose the software to the regulator

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,370
and explain if there is a defeat device

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,390
what exactly is it for and how the hell

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:02,280
is this supposed to protect the engine

00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,020
another area where we're seeing an

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,770
increasing importance of software is

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,050
robotics and implants so it's not just

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:12,180
that the cars that are driving on our

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,190
streets will eventually not be driven by

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,710
people anymore and will become robots

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:19,950
we're also introducing robots into

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,600
healthcare at the workplace in a way

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,000
that they're directly interacting with

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:29,130
humans and we also have software running

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,720
inside humans a less scary example of

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,490
this is perhaps a friend of mine who

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,490
wears a cochlear implant which is a

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:38,580
digital hearing aid that can transform

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,940
and sound into a digital signal and

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,770
allows him to hear if there is a

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,720
software willner ability in this kind of

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,100
device perhaps the worst thing that

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,500
could happen to you is that you don't

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,330
hear something that is there or perhaps

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,470
even that you hear something that is not

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:57,510
there something more scary more scary

00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,950
example of software not doing what it's

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,640
supposed to would be software on a

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:05,060
pacemaker and there was an accident talk

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,590
by the security researcher Mary mo

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:11,280
called uncatchable living with a

00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,500
vulnerable implanted device now that

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,410
sounds a lot more scary actually in her

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,530
case she was wearing a pacemaker she was

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,750
not able to inspect the source code on

00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:25,320
this pacemaker and it turned out that it

00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:27,000
had a bug and when she suddenly fell

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,280
down when she was walking up a flight of

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,200
stairs they couldn't simply see what

00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,910
exactly the software was doing instead

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,160
they basically had to put her on a truck

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:40,890
on a treadmill and troubleshooter so

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,470
what Mary mo is saying about this is

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,450
that I want to know what code runs on my

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,510
body which i think is an incredibly

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,150
reasonable demand from government but

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,980
this is also something that the european

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,710
parliament is discussing thankfully

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,330
however whenever there is a good idea of

00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,760
what we should do with new technology

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,650
there's also a bad idea so the european

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,480
parliament is also discussing whether

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,990
robots and artificial intelligent

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,360
that create new works for example an

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,370
algorithm created song whether there

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,389
should be copyright on that which i

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,100
think is a terrible idea so these

00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,019
questions are definitely something that

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,120
is under development in the government's

00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,699
at the moment and something that we need

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,350
to pay attention to something that's a

00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:30,660
much older debate is the use of

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:33,339
technology in elections in the u.s.

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,260
voting systems are have not been

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:37,680
considered critical infrastructure by

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,610
the Department of Homeland Security so

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,160
even though there are lots of

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,740
independent reports that show that a lot

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,389
of the voting systems the voting

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,699
software that is being used on a

00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:51,220
municipal or regional level even though

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:53,130
it's known that it's unsafe it isn't

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,170
really treated like much of a problem

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:59,019
another good example from Estonia that

00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,600
is already doing online elections they

00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:03,610
had actually won invalid vote via the

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,410
online voting system which apparently

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,680
comes from one member of the pirate

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:11,790
party so I think it's really important

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,230
that we also have the possibility to

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,630
inspect any kind of software that is

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,839
basically being used to fulfill

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,790
extremely important functions of course

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,800
you extol Estonian online election

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:27,519
system is not a hundred percent free and

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,860
open source software then there's also

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,959
this this debate about whether Facebook

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,029
algorithms can influence election

00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,149
outcomes which I guess are more social

00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:39,250
debates but really show that that there

00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:42,639
is quite an issue that needs to be

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,100
discussed one more example what we call

00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,709
predictive policing which is basically

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,620
the use of data about previous crimes to

00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:53,319
predict where future crimes are going to

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,170
take place I think this is a really good

00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:57,550
example of showing that machines

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,850
basically can only learn from our own

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:04,300
dumb behavior so for example this

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:07,449
predictive policing has been criticized

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,329
for perpetuating racist stereotypes so

00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:13,720
for example in the war on drugs on

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:15,790
average white people take more drugs

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,040
than black people and also engage more

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,959
selling and buying however the

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,500
number of black people actually arrested

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:25,810
on drug crimes is a lot higher so if you

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,509
base your predictions of future crimes

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,790
on what has happened before you're not

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:33,459
actually raising it on the real

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:37,269
incidence of crime but only on the crime

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:39,759
that we know about so there is a real

00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:41,920
danger that if we don't know how exactly

00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,170
this kind of software works we can't

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,079
find out whether there are biases that

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,730
are built into it and I think from a

00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,190
fundamental rights perspective it's

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,440
extremely important that whenever a

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,000
public administration the police or

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,579
government there's something that is

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,160
directly to your disadvantage that they

00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:02,680
owe you an explanation of why they came

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,810
to this conclusion and if we use

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,610
proprietary software in order to make

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,230
decisions this is certainly not the case

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:14,009
and perhaps on a less serious note

00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:18,519
everything's becoming Internet of Things

00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:20,740
sometimes makes free software more

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,110
critical because if you have Windows 10

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,000
running on your fridge basically if you

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,819
have more proprietary software running

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,199
on everything they're more fun ways how

00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:35,290
your software can fail so this is one

00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:37,389
part of the problem but I think the fact

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,180
that there's more technology around us

00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:42,250
it's not a problem as such it becomes a

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,260
problem if at the same time we are

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,209
legally barred from controlling this

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,540
software and this is something that's

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:51,910
happening on quite a lot of fields

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:55,600
edward Felton who was an academic in

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:58,810
this nowadays the deputy CTO of the

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,459
United States he coined this term of the

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,519
freedom to tinker in the early two

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:05,350
thousand and it's one that goes beyond

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,990
just the mere act of being able to

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,750
access source code but it's a full

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:13,209
freedom to inspect to understand to

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,880
repair to modify both software and

00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:20,800
hardware and it's based on the idea that

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:22,509
you can't actually learn to write only

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,220
by reading so you do have to interact

00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,439
with the system in order to fully

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,060
understand it and also to be able to

00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:30,069
build something new based on the things

00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,990
that you've learned so this freedom to

00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:34,839
tinker is really important as the

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:37,209
basis of education as a basis for

00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,399
innovation and also in order to give

00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,130
people autonomy over the devices that

00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:44,200
they buy and I think this freedom to

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:47,260
tinker should be protected in a similar

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,120
way as the freedom of speech there are

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,580
recently some lobby groups who are

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,250
working particularly on protecting and

00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,320
in training this freedom to tinker a lot

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,320
of them in the inn at the moment are

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,610
based in the US there's for example I am

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,410
the cavalry which is a group of security

00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:09,070
researchers that are really trying to

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:11,830
make the the hardware that is part of

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,720
our lives trustworthy insecure and allow

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,430
people to understand them there's also

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,630
the right to repair group and other

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:21,670
groups that are working on this theme

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:24,130
but the freedom of tinker is under

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:27,940
attack from a lot of different types of

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:30,100
legislation one is quite a fundamental

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,980
problem with the way that digital

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,170
content is dealt with in the law that is

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,690
that information is governed quite

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:40,149
differently from physical goods so as a

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:43,300
simple example if i buy a book i own

00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:45,430
this book if i buy an e-book I have a

00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,290
usage license that is perhaps not

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,270
transferable so if I have a big

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,670
collection of ebooks I can't actually

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:55,870
give this collection to my children when

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:58,380
I die and of course when more and more

00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:01,540
products are a kind of a mixture of

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,820
physical good and information what the

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,390
manufacturers in the industry try to do

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,010
is to transpose this logic from the

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,589
dealing with information onto those

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:14,680
products and try to rent us things

00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,690
rather than have us by them one good of

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,000
example of this was the controversy

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,980
around the John Deere tractor where the

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,899
manufacturer was basically saying that

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,720
the people who had bought this tractor

00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:27,250
were not allowed to actually repair the

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,829
tractor themselves because there were

00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:34,750
just license holder of this tractor and

00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:39,160
they were not able to modify it yeah it

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:40,959
was said in the in the beginning of this

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,880
talk that I had made some

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,350
recommendations around copyright reform

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,110
that were actually a top

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:49,900
by the European Parliament for example I

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,460
fought for public domain status of

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,790
official works so that would mean that

00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,150
any kind of work of art of photography

00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:00,370
writing whatever that was created by an

00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,830
employee of public administration during

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,660
their work time was considered to be in

00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:08,020
the public domain name was not covered

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,640
by copyright another demand was that the

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,610
circumvention of technological

00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,950
protections for legal purposes so for

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:17,440
example if you have legally bought a CD

00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,720
and you've already paid the levy for

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,670
being able to make copies of it and you

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,180
should be able to actually circumvent

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:28,420
the drm to make copies even though quite

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:30,910
a lot of such common sense demands were

00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,800
supported by the European Parliament the

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:36,010
European Commission's proposal for a

00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,840
copyright reform has now been leaked and

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,240
all of these common-sense ideas have

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,670
been shot down instead we're going to

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,400
get a new right for news publishers to

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,200
control how we share news online and an

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,810
obligation for any kind of Internet

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,530
platforms that have user-generated

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:56,860
content to use technology to scan for

00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,720
copyright infringement so um this is a

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,240
topic for another talk and I will be

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,030
working on on stopping these terrible

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,330
developments for months to come but it's

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,240
also another way of showing that also in

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,250
the area of copyright there is no

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,100
positive development yet that would

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:19,750
actually give us more control over the

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:21,400
stuff that we buy another area that is

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,850
becoming more and more concerning our

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,070
trade secrets so trade secrets started

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,590
out as being a way of defending against

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,390
anti-competitive behavior so basically

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,640
if you're one car manufacturer and

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:37,650
somebody from the other car manufacturer

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,060
breaks into your office and steals all

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,710
your plans that would be something that

00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,460
would have traditionally been covered by

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:47,530
trade secrets but nowadays it's no

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,930
longer about whether or not there's a

00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,690
competitor involved it's the information

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:54,790
as such that is protected so a car maker

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,920
can claim for example that the software

00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,130
on the car is a trade secret and

00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,810
therefore the regulator

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,430
can't even look at it to find out

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,680
whether they're cheating on the

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,960
emissions tests and of course the

00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,660
regulator is in no way in a competent in

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,280
a competitive situation to this car

00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,970
maker so it actually doesn't make any

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:16,220
sense but quite concerning Lee the

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,650
United States are slowly introducing

00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,600
this into trade agreements with other

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,360
parts of the world and the argument is

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,880
if you allow governments to require

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,660
companies to disclose software then

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,550
basically China is going to copy all our

00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,770
innovation and give the information to

00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:36,440
their own companies so I think we have

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,290
to make sure that if we want to mandate

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,600
more source code disclosure from

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,000
manufacturers we have to make sure that

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:48,770
in international trade our governments

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,510
actually remain able to do this they are

00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,930
not just legal but also social

00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:57,100
developments that I think make free

00:19:53,930 --> 00:20:00,170
software and open systems more important

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:03,680
on the twenty-eighth chaos communication

00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:06,650
congress cory doctorow was warning about

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,540
a future in which more and more devices

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,820
have their functionality crippled on

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,650
purpose or something that is sold to you

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,200
that could be a fully functioning

00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:17,720
computer is somehow locked in that only

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,330
certain functions of it work and of

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,310
course we know nowadays that with every

00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:25,280
smartphone and every smart fridge and

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,140
smart home we buy that we are coming

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,630
closer to this reality because the

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,460
consumer simply lose the expectation

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,140
that if they buy a computer they

00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,840
actually able to do what they want with

00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,340
it and that they're actually able to

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,180
install the operating system they want

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:45,050
and so on so I think that's definitely a

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:48,080
really important and dangerous social

00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:52,280
and technological development finally

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:55,010
there are also some moves from new laws

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,810
regarding what kind of software and

00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,440
firmware can be installed on routers

00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:03,010
once again there's kind of a public

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,350
security argument for that that is that

00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:09,710
the manufacturers of the router should

00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,790
make sure that users cannot accidentally

00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,530
or non

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,860
use the wrong spectrum with these

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:19,190
devices but at the same time in order to

00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,950
allow competition for example the FCC

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:25,280
and the United States has found that

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:27,470
they should allow firmware from third

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,630
parties to be installed but how do you

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,420
do this how do you on the one hand limit

00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:34,610
what the third party software can do and

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:38,000
on the other hand still keep it open to

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,530
different firmwares so I think what's

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,900
going to happen one possible

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,520
reconciliation is that on routers we're

00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,980
also going to have kind of trusted

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,080
computing solutions with a cryptographic

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,450
signature for any kind of firm where

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,430
they can be installed on them and this

00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,410
is already the case for most computers

00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:58,250
that are being sold with secure boot and

00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:00,020
so on and is of course especially for

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,750
for lay people making the install

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:06,320
installation of Linux incredibly more

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:08,750
challenging so a lot of these examples

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,850
are kind of bad things that are going on

00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,760
in the legislative process but also some

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,350
broader societal things so what can the

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,660
government do about it and can we

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:22,820
actually rely upon the government to do

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:26,840
anything I think it's important to

00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:29,480
recognize that we can influence the

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,550
government in activities if we actually

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,970
decide to prioritize on listen to not

00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:37,100
just build software but to actually make

00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,660
sure that governments understand how

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,180
free and open source software is in

00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,580
their in their interest and for that we

00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,850
do need the practical arguments that

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:49,190
government administration's already rely

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,170
on free and open source software in a

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,970
lot of cases and that's in their

00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,590
interest that the software is secure

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,630
that it's well maintained and that

00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,220
there's a community behind it that can

00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,710
actually do its work and it's not

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,240
hindered by a counterproductive

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,920
legislation so in other words the

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,400
government has to start taking

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:12,020
responsibility and further the goals of

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,810
security safety etc that are represented

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:17,060
by the free software movement so there

00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:19,760
are some positive examples of how this

00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:22,460
is being done there are simply funding

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,150
ways like the prototype fund in Germany

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,100
where basically

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:30,150
money is directly given to open source

00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:32,130
projects and the prototype fund also not

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,260
just gives money but also helps the

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,420
project deal with the bureaucracy around

00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,970
it and make the process easier for

00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,010
people who are not used to working with

00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:46,200
with public administrations on a daily

00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:48,570
basis but perhaps more well pretty

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,490
pretty obvious thing from recent news

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,430
that's also important our security

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:55,850
audits so in 2014 we had the heartbleed

00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:58,320
and shell shock vulnerabilities that

00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,300
demonstrated that a lot of

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,400
infrastructure is relying on free and

00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,130
open source software but quite often

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,720
there is no responsibility even from

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,970
large companies and governments that are

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,530
using this software to actually

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:16,350
contribute to its functioning to finding

00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,300
software bugs and to making sure that

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,610
this that they're giving something back

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,910
to the community that is developing

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:26,340
these tools so the European Commission

00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:28,980
upon the initiative of a colleague of

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,290
mine and myself has started a pilot

00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,960
project for free and open source

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:36,270
software auditing now we had to somehow

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,790
convince the commission that it's a good

00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,770
idea to try to build relationships with

00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:43,770
a free software community and to show

00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:47,610
them how this also has a benefit for

00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:50,180
themselves so some parts of this project

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:53,030
that have already taken place is that

00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:56,100
the European Commission was

00:24:53,030 --> 00:25:00,120
investigating different methodologies

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,670
for how to do audits how the the

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,620
software code is being maintained and

00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:07,020
governed in different existing community

00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,490
projects and also to do an inventory of

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,650
all the free and open source software

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:15,750
that is currently being used in the free

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:18,480
software in the European institutions or

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:20,280
that they use in order to build a new

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,260
software that is commissioned by

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,040
themselves so existing software

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,470
libraries etc and the purpose of this is

00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,120
also to find common interests so to see

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,040
okay this is a software that the

00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,430
European Commission is really relying on

00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:37,280
but it also has a great value to the

00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:39,590
community at large so

00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,390
in order to find out which projects

00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:43,810
actually do have this common interest

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:48,170
and that would be most interesting for

00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:50,000
the community to also be looked into in

00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:54,350
order to do that we we did a public

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,850
survey where we basically asked out of a

00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,590
number of different free software

00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,230
projects that were news in the

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:03,590
institutions which one's the community

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:06,730
would like to see audited and from this

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:10,040
public survey we had two projects that

00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:14,270
got the most votes namely the apache

00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:17,210
HTTP server and key pass of course

00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:20,030
apache is already widely used in not

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:23,450
just in the european institutions but

00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:26,270
also beyond keepass is actually not used

00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:29,930
by huge numbers inside the commission so

00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:31,490
far but it got a lot of public votes and

00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:35,210
i think it's a good example of a user

00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,980
space software so something where the

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:41,000
security is really important for the end

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:43,280
user and there's really it makes sense

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,310
to them why this kind of software should

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,440
be audited so this two years pilot

00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:51,410
project is coming to an end there's

00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:56,510
currently a company that is doing the

00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:59,270
audit of these two projects and in the

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:01,070
running of this project we've also run

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,710
into some challenges that are mostly

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,900
read to do with how to make sure that

00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,240
the European Commission as basically a

00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,190
public administration that so far has

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,530
not had a lot of dealings with a free

00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,970
software community actually understand

00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,940
what they're doing how they get the

00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,770
expertise from the community and how we

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,110
can hold them accountable that they

00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,910
actually listen to it and in this

00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:26,180
process the Free Software Foundation

00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:28,640
Europe has been extremely involved and

00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,500
really always trying to push us in the

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,800
right direction because I have to say as

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:36,410
a member of parliament the the amount of

00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,780
time that I can spend on running after a

00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:41,380
consultancy that is doing an audit is

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:44,480
limited but I think we do have

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,700
identified also how we can improve this

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,010
project so we're trying to continue it

00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,759
to get a budget for the next few years

00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:52,769
and

00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,019
to eventually make it a permanent part

00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:57,329
of the EU budget and one thing that we

00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:59,509
really want to do is in the future to do

00:27:57,329 --> 00:28:03,149
a bug bounty program where we directly

00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:05,759
take a large part of the money that is

00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:07,799
put in the budget in order to make

00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,609
people the experts in the community

00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:16,139
themselves look for bugs and get

00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:18,149
remunerated for that so for projects

00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:20,039
like this I think the involvement of the

00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:22,379
community is really important but also

00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:24,029
the patience of the community because of

00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:26,309
course working with the big

00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:29,249
administration can be quite frustrating

00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:32,009
and I think especially in this case is

00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:33,989
it really pays off to be organized as a

00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:36,719
community to actually have an advocacy

00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:40,319
organization that is doing this this

00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:43,109
work for you so what's going to happen

00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,969
next what can we actually achieve I

00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:46,919
think on the one hand of course simply

00:28:44,969 --> 00:28:49,440
developing the software the direct

00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:52,169
action on that is incredibly important

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,940
but at the same time it's also very

00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:56,549
important to try to work within the

00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,069
system and to try to build networks

00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,599
between the free software community and

00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:03,089
politicians who actually care about

00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:06,059
these issues because I'm certainly not

00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:08,009
the only one we can also look at some

00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:10,349
success stories where open-source

00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:13,409
policies have been passed there's

00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:15,479
recently been one in Bulgaria there's

00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:18,059
also the US federal source code policy

00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:20,219
which you know are not perfect policies

00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:23,519
so what the US is doing for example is

00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:25,859
saying okay all software that a

00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,079
government agency Commission's needs to

00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:31,319
be reusable for the entire government

00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,809
which of course makes a lot of sense and

00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,849
they have a goal of actually publishing

00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:38,639
twenty percent of the software that a

00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:40,589
commission as open source software which

00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:43,049
is well not what we are going to aim for

00:29:40,589 --> 00:29:45,539
but it's certainly better than nothing

00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:48,239
and more than a lot of European

00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:51,599
governments are doing at the moment the

00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:55,349
European Commission does have an open

00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:57,509
source policy but it's very well very

00:29:55,349 --> 00:30:00,299
basic in the sense that for example they

00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:03,269
commit to not disadvantaging open source

00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,419
solutions in public procurement which is

00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:07,809
nice I mean I

00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:09,519
if simply offering a free software or

00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:11,649
open source solution were considered

00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,929
disadvantage that would certainly be a

00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:15,730
problem but where we want to get to of

00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:17,859
course is that they actually considered

00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,919
in an advantage and that they make it a

00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:24,159
requirement so here's my call for action

00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:25,779
and this is something that i think the

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,690
the Free Software Foundation has already

00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:31,119
laid the groundwork for is that we need

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,820
to move towards a sustainable public

00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,100
procurement system and that every

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,559
government in the EU as well as the

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:42,059
European Commission actually have a free

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:45,519
software policy that means that all the

00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:47,739
software that is developed with public

00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,190
money will actually be published in a

00:30:47,739 --> 00:30:53,769
public under a free license and is

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,840
reusable for anyone because at the end

00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:59,109
the government is acting in the public

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,149
interest the FSF is already starting a

00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:03,909
mapping exercise to see what is already

00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:05,230
out there what inefficiency could be

00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:07,509
addressed with free and open source

00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,659
software and if you want to to get

00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:13,539
active in that I think they definitely

00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:16,389
welcome people who may be experts with

00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:18,340
what different municipalities are doing

00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:21,429
or simply have the technical expertise

00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:23,619
to contribute to that so I think our

00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:25,779
goal needs to be to make government not

00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:27,639
just tolerate and use free and open

00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:31,169
source software but to actually promote

00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:31,169
and improve it thank

00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:03,100
thank you very much for this a very

00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:09,400
interesting talk now it's time for a

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:12,400
question and answer first thanks for

00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:15,970
your talk thoughts about auditing

00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,400
software I think it's not enough to just

00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,200
audit the code because that that is

00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,090
opening Pandora's box that you also have

00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,040
to audit the processes of the people who

00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:27,429
created are they actually reacting to

00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,200
security problems which brings the next

00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:31,480
problem if you audit code and you find a

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,130
huge number of bugs in keepass for

00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,080
example you are being the nice person

00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:42,460
you put them all in there bugzilla and

00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:44,590
then you have a problem so it also has

00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:49,059
to be fixed how can make sure that

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:50,710
happens should that be done by public

00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:53,920
resources as well what are your thoughts

00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,230
on that well I one thing that we really

00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,360
try to push for and as far as i know

00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:01,420
that actually has happened is that

00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,580
before the Commission or the company

00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,380
that the Commission has put in charge of

00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,300
doing the audit before they actually

00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,340
start doing the audit they do have to

00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,380
get in touch with the community with the

00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,960
developer that they know that this audit

00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,910
is going on that they are the first to

00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,830
be informed if something is found and

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:20,950
that they can actually process this

00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:23,530
input in a meaningful way I think if we

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,720
if we go towards the model of Park

00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:28,270
bounties of course actually fixing the

00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,179
bug can be a part of that and I think

00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:33,070
that's probably more easy to do if we

00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:34,900
create incentives for the people who are

00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:37,360
already developing the software that

00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,600
they can actually work on fixing those

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,420
bugs and the processes are actually part

00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,600
of of the pilot project in the sense

00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,820
that the first step of it was that there

00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,800
was a comparison being done between the

00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,140
processes of software development within

00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,510
the European Commission and indifferent

00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:58,000
free software projects however though

00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:00,850
there were apparently some problems with

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,620
that in the sense that not every free

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:06,010
software project that was supposed to be

00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:08,139
contacted actually was contacted and so

00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,040
some some inaccurate information

00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:12,280
actually

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:15,760
it up in the report I think if we do

00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:19,600
manage to get funding to improve or to

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,030
continue the process and to do a next

00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,120
step on based on this pilot project this

00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:29,200
criticism that also to two large extent

00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:32,440
was collected by FS Fe and given to me

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,040
is extremely and valuable because I I

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,510
don't have the expertise to know

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,640
everything that may go wrong so to have

00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:42,490
actually the community actively involved

00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,929
and know who to tell either in the

00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:45,160
parliament or in the Commission if

00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:53,140
something's going wrong is really

00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:55,840
important hi thanks for the talk here so

00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,420
I wanted to ask you said that software

00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,790
that is developed with the public

00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,230
resources should be released and should

00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,660
be free and released as open source

00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:08,500
right so I want you might have said this

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:10,150
but what is the status of that I mean is

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,930
it is that something that is about to

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:16,990
happen is that happening in every city

00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:19,930
in every European country but how does

00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:22,180
that work at the moment it's certainly

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,800
not happening everywhere is I think it's

00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,410
more the exception rather than the rule

00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:30,540
that a pack like administration actually

00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:35,500
has a policy like that and we do have

00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:38,500
similar rules for example in the in the

00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:41,200
sciences funding by the European Union

00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:45,400
so the horizon 2020 program for example

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,800
requires you to release all the research

00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,450
results under open access but

00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,390
unfortunately so far this doesn't

00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:54,100
include the any software that may have

00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,020
been programmed as part of this research

00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:02,080
exercise so I think at the moment

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:04,240
there's really a lack of well really

00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,350
commitment to this call and as far as I

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:10,390
know at least to my knowledge Bulgaria

00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:13,270
is the only country in the ue you that I

00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:15,370
know of where this is basically a

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,620
national level government policy there

00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:20,790
may be others but in certain certainly

00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,790
in Germany it's not the case

00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:28,580
yeah thanks for the talk so sometimes it

00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:31,260
appears to be like you're the only

00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:33,780
person in the European Parliament at

00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,600
least for me to understand some topics

00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,300
and what is the situation in European

00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,250
Parliament and what would be your

00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:44,790
suggestions for normal people like me

00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:47,790
just FSF I fellows to support the cause

00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:50,730
and to prevent stupid decisions and the

00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,950
Commission maybe you know also in

00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,510
European Parliament's someone who can be

00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:58,680
just notched in the right direction

00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:00,900
night or yeah well I think there are

00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,060
different strategies I'm certainly not

00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,490
the only person who is walking or who's

00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:09,360
working on these topics but sometimes

00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:11,400
you have to draw a connection between

00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,320
the thing that the parliamentarian is

00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,180
really interested in and then your

00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,400
topics so for example all my colleagues

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,350
from the Green Party are extremely

00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,750
interested in the diesel gate scandal

00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:24,270
and how exactly it worked because

00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:27,300
they're really interested in doing

00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:30,900
something about pollution so being able

00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,520
to somehow connect the the topics to the

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,150
topics that people are already working

00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,650
on is really useful strategy but I think

00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:41,880
another thing that's important is that

00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:43,710
for volunteers it is still quite

00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,260
difficult to have the same level of

00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,600
influence as the industry so actually

00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,910
having an association that is

00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,860
represented in Brussels with people

00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:56,700
working full time on this is also really

00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:58,710
important but in comparison to I would

00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,020
say a national Member of Parliament the

00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:03,300
number of people who contact MEP s

00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,880
directly is still rather limited so if

00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,860
it's about stopping a bad proposal then

00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,080
sometimes just getting lots and lots of

00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,910
people to write to their representatives

00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:15,090
to all their representatives about this

00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,680
can be a useful strategy but that works

00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:19,070
much better if you want to stop

00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,470
something bad then if you want to get

00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:25,190
people actually interested in changing

00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:30,210
something for the better but we do have

00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:32,190
an intergroup that is made up of people

00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,440
from different political parties that

00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,650
deals with Internet policy on a broader

00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,200
level and they

00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,670
you sometimes take positions i mean it's

00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,040
certainly the more progressive members

00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,720
of the parliament even though there are

00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,730
people represented from all over the

00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,130
board and for example they have been

00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:50,710
really active in opposing this new

00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:54,760
copyright for publishers for newspaper

00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:56,920
articles so i think yeah if you if you

00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,840
want specific names you can certainly

00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,630
write me an email but other than that I

00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:04,240
think organizing as an association and

00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:06,100
actually sending people to Brussels to

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:12,610
knock on people's doors is extremely

00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:15,250
important I am what you've talked about

00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,620
there for three soft where is a very

00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:19,900
good move but one of the problems at the

00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,700
moment is that if you report a security

00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,710
vulnerability against some closed-source

00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,500
software there's no requirement on the

00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,330
manufacturer to actually fix it so are

00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,760
you making any moves towards actually

00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:32,920
requiring that manufacturers support

00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,870
software or the very least provide

00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,680
definitions of when L supporters and

00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:41,470
when they won't I'm not directly

00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,150
involved in this I know that one of my

00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:47,710
colleagues Yun Philip I pledged was

00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:50,470
trying to get some some vulnerability

00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:52,750
disclosure requirements into the network

00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:55,150
and information security directive which

00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:58,330
is mostly about like critical

00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:01,960
infrastructure and so on there are some

00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:04,930
moves in the areas of consumer law so

00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,910
basically if you buy a device that you

00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:09,460
have certain rights as a consumer as to

00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:12,220
continued support of the software

00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,040
running on that but this is really still

00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:17,950
in very early stages and these are the

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,930
only developments I can think of where

00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,400
this is being addressed but at the

00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,820
moment there doesn't seem to be such a

00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,820
requirement

00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:37,339
so we have as technology makers and

00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:39,320
especially government the responsibility

00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:41,780
to make all technology accessible to

00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,339
every citizen you didn't talk a lot

00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,430
about that but that's also an important

00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:47,839
thing to make software free so anybody

00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,609
can extend them in different ways

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,220
there's many people with disabilities of

00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:53,810
any kind or have not very powerful

00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,540
computers and so on there's another any

00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:59,420
kind of so does that come up in

00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:02,570
conversations that or somebody is also

00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,130
mentioning that the conversations um we

00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,200
haven't actually made the connection

00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,450
between accessibility and free software

00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,150
too much so far but it's actually a

00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:14,480
really good point the European

00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:16,730
Parliament recently passed the web

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,040
accessibility directive which will at

00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:21,020
least force public administration's to

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,680
make their websites and apps and so on

00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:27,680
freely accessible and of course in in

00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,450
many cases actually doing that can be

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,160
much easier by using free and open

00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:34,250
source software and you already have

00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,109
people who are kind of working on the

00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,990
software also to make it more usable for

00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:41,150
themselves and so I hope that this can

00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:43,550
give some positive impulses in this

00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:45,770
direction unfortunately I mean the web

00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,380
accessibility directive alone which is

00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:51,410
relatively limited in scope really to

00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,900
the government administration's will

00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,310
still take years to go into effect I

00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:59,480
mean you basically have really strong

00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:01,069
lobbying from the municipalities who are

00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,230
saying they don't have any money to do

00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:06,140
this even though actually you know

00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:08,690
forcing somebody with a disability to go

00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:12,319
personally to the administration and

00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,970
have them deal with the things that

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,450
don't work in their software can be a

00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,980
lot more expensive and I hope that

00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:22,160
there's going to be more of a change in

00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:24,670
the mindset in the municipalities that

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,200
making things accessible is actually a

00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:29,500
priority human rights issue and also

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:36,890
simply make sense in their own

00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:39,589
procedures this is something I'm

00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:42,290
wondering about this somebody who's kind

00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:44,329
of involved with F is a fee do you think

00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,340
that it would make sense for us as an

00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:49,700
organization to also target

00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:53,450
national lobbying more or should we like

00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:57,500
focus our efforts on the EU because that

00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:59,510
makes the most sense I think both makes

00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:02,870
sense because for example if you want

00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:04,430
your municipal I don't know your city

00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:07,400
cons council or your public

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,800
administration to use free software then

00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,380
the European Union will have a very

00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,320
difficult time mandating that what you

00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,960
can get at the European Union is to make

00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,600
sure that we have sensible information

00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,750
policy laws so when it comes to a

00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,430
copyright to trade secrets and so on and

00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,410
of course to get the European

00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:31,790
institutions to actually use and promote

00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:34,550
free software but as a general rule the

00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:37,370
the national States they have bigger

00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:38,540
budgets they have a lot of oversight

00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:40,580
over the different public

00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,680
administrations that are really right in

00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:44,480
front of your doorstep so I would say

00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,080
that definitely both approaches make

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,080
perfect sense

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,850
hi additional question on the releasing

00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,730
the software is open source so as

00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:10,490
understood there is no plan to enforce

00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:13,970
that right it is more of a suggestion to

00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:17,000
the government to start making software

00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:19,400
and releasing it or is there a law is

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,710
there any plan to enforce that no there

00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,140
is no law yet so there's nothing to

00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:27,740
enforce but I think that should be our

00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:30,980
goal and it's something that I think if

00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:33,620
the government's really well get

00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,330
informed about the topics will realize

00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,460
that it actually makes sense for them to

00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:40,370
but I think what would make the most

00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:42,620
sense for an organization like FS Fe is

00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:46,100
to actually lobby for such a law to be

00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:48,710
put in place both as regards to European

00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:51,380
institutions as well as on a national

00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:53,390
level but at the moment such law doesn't

00:44:51,380 --> 00:45:06,230
exist in well pretty much all of the

00:44:53,390 --> 00:45:10,280
European countries okay thank you hello

00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:13,370
a great speech and I like the fact that

00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,470
our funds now to do all it on security

00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:18,710
issues I was wondering if it would be

00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:21,230
feasible to do auditing on compliance to

00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:23,090
interoperability to see if software is

00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:25,880
actually following the standards that we

00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:27,680
set as a community and currently it's

00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,360
actually very profitable for companies

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,490
to not follow interoperability standards

00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:34,940
and this is costing us a lot of money so

00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:37,630
it would be great if we would set some

00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:40,160
money aside to actually check that

00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:42,560
software that were buying follow certain

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,640
standards that we require because

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:48,170
currently there's very little

00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:50,960
information about that yeah usually it's

00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:53,660
the member states that have to make sure

00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,250
that European laws are being enforced

00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,800
and that there's actually enough money

00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:59,570
to enforce them so I'm not a hundred

00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,250
percent sure whether it's possible to

00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:03,770
pay for that through the EU budget

00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:05,750
because it would basically be well

00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,270
admitting that the member states are not

00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:11,540
doing their jobs what the Commission can

00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:14,840
do is if if a member state is

00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:18,560
not following its requirements which

00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:20,180
usually includes enforcing the law the

00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,760
Commission can start an infringement

00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:25,090
procedure against this state which can

00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:28,070
become relatively costly for the state

00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:29,810
but yeah I would have to look into that

00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:32,030
whether it's possible for the Commission

00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:34,640
to actually or for the european union

00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:36,560
budget to directly fund enforcement of

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,850
existing laws because well this is

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:52,700
something that they should be doing

00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:55,610
anyway right so in the u.s. i see some

00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:57,440
positive improvements like you already

00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:59,570
mentioned this White House policy which

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,690
is of course not perfect but what I also

00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:04,100
see in the US and I at least had her to

00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:06,380
talks like from the digital

00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:10,370
infrastructure agency or something and

00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:12,920
18 f so they're like groups of people

00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:14,180
filling up I don't know exactly how the

00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,850
structure looks like but deadly

00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,470
government-funded we were writing free

00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,690
software open source software which is

00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:22,850
all like on github and they're great

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,920
people they all do like a start-up

00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:26,930
mentality and agile do you see any

00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,180
future for this and in Europe because I

00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:31,640
think this would also drives us forward

00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:34,280
without any policies because if you have

00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,480
a body of people doing great work and

00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,730
free software then you don't need to

00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:42,860
reach out to proprietary vendors anymore

00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:45,680
right well as I understand this this

00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:48,340
project the prototype fund is that it

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,620
does something like that so it basically

00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,270
gives money directly to projects that

00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:55,670
are building open source software for

00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:59,030
for different uses and those could of

00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:02,450
course also be uses that have a direct

00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:04,450
use inside the government so but you

00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:07,070
know the prototype fund and also the

00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:09,020
open-source security audit by the

00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:12,230
Commission they have a budget of around

00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:14,370
a million euros so this is nice but it's

00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:17,790
basically just

00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:20,520
start and it can't really finance such

00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:22,110
projects on a grander scale so from what

00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,780
you've described i would think that

00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:27,870
probably these projects have bigger

00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,910
budgets and that's probably something

00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:31,980
that we need to work on and therefore

00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,780
it's also important to make sure that

00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,900
these small projects that do exist

00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:41,250
actually become successful and that

00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:42,990
basically it becomes well useful for a

00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,910
politician to promote something like

00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,440
that if they see okay this is something

00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,150
that people are interested in is

00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,560
something that can win them points and

00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,560
they're likely to try to do it again

00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,760
well all is top we've hurt now was

00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:05,730
mainly about software written by the

00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,080
government or for the government and all

00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,780
the scary things we've seen in the

00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:12,450
beginning we're about cars and

00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,040
pacemakers and things that are certainly

00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:16,560
not written by the government of for the

00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:20,540
government wouldn't it make more sense

00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:23,250
to put pressure on death sites to

00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,950
require the companies that write that

00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:30,000
code to make the code free software so

00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:32,700
that can be expected sure I think

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,570
there's not always a clear line and the

00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:38,190
same software is the same free and open

00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:40,350
source software is being used inside

00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,900
government and inside large corporations

00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:44,790
to some extent but of course a lot of

00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:48,030
problems are with proprietary software

00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:49,620
and but I do think that the government

00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:54,090
will be much more likely to actually

00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:57,870
mandate disclosing of software in

00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:59,670
critical devices such as cars is if they

00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,680
are already using open source software

00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:04,560
themselves because if they feel like

00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,750
this mandating can actually make somehow

00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,880
their own governmental procedures

00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:11,220
insecure then they're probably much less

00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,400
likely to go down this route so i think

00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:17,580
it's it's probably important to go down

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,110
both la's but as a first step i think

00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,820
it's really important to kind of to try

00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:23,370
to get the government on your side on

00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,450
these free software topics and if

00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:26,940
they're not using free software

00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:33,900
themselves then they're probably

00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:36,839
not going to see the merits of it hi I'm

00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:40,109
I just wanted to say that not only

00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:42,230
software is important but to pierre

00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:45,240
computers using a heart rate is you just

00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:47,790
try to lock down the hard way on last

00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:51,210
year's and it would be really important

00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:54,780
that we look at that and say that they

00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:56,819
have it has to be possible to have open

00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,760
systems which are not in lockdown for

00:50:56,819 --> 00:51:04,200
government institutions hmm yeah or for

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:07,020
anyone really so one of those laws that

00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,480
we are working on is this router

00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:12,000
lockdown directive or that's what we

00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:15,510
like to call it we're as far as i can

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,310
tell nobody realized at the time that

00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:19,619
this directive was passed that it would

00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:22,589
create problems for like fry funk and

00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:24,150
other open Wi-Fi communities and that it

00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:26,520
would make it difficult to run free

00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:30,990
software and routers so i think

00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:32,700
basically having people there who

00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:35,880
actually understand free software and

00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:38,250
who can look at the legislative process

00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:41,160
as it is going on and jump in there and

00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:42,960
point out problems is sometimes all it

00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,510
takes and at the time there was nobody

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,170
there who was doing that so now we have

00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:51,319
to try to somehow avoid the problem down

00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:53,970
the line as the member states are

00:51:51,319 --> 00:52:06,869
transposing this directive international

00:51:53,970 --> 00:52:10,079
laws thank you hi I have a question

00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:15,450
regarding the open-source audit what are

00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:17,990
the arguments if somebody has concerns

00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:22,800
that the European Commission is helping

00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:27,119
one product by down by funding their

00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:30,119
security audit and first making their

00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,369
position on the market better yeah we

00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,170
were discussing that but we decided it's

00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:37,500
not really a problem because if they

00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:39,569
find something this improvement at the

00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,850
end of the day benefits everyone and if

00:52:39,569 --> 00:52:42,570
for

00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:45,580
example there's a fork of this project

00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:47,110
that is developing it in a different

00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,120
direction which seems to be the case

00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:51,930
with kip as-tu a pretty large extent

00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,830
there's a good chance that any any

00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:56,320
vulnerability that could be found is

00:52:53,830 --> 00:53:00,250
also relevant for that other project so

00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:03,220
of course whenever the government is

00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:04,930
funding something that is organized by

00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:08,380
citizens or organized by the private

00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:10,570
sector there maybe ten different

00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:13,270
projects that don't get funded and you

00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:15,310
can say that this is unfair but I think

00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:18,820
it would be probably we would all be

00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:21,250
worse off if we reacted to this by not

00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:25,060
having any public funding for public

00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:28,600
interest goals at all i have to say that

00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:32,160
you really as the leaf in point so there

00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,160
are we have time for two last questions

00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,420
at least to me UK we're seeing the

00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:43,450
increasing privatization of public

00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:46,080
services has there been any discussion

00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:48,520
that you've witnessed with regard to

00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,400
overseeing use of factory software by

00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:54,540
bees private organizations but providing

00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,540
essential public services like education

00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:59,460
well there's certainly a discussion

00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,020
about all the problems that we have

00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,880
thanks to some of the privatisations

00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:08,350
that have taken place and how they have

00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:10,360
taken place i'm not sure that the the

00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:13,750
use of software by these companies as

00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:15,700
such is being addressed but yeah i would

00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:24,910
i would have to look into that i can't

00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:32,460
think of an example right now final

00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:39,839
question for you

00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:41,869
the person so the aged cynic in me

00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:44,369
cannot help but remember that the

00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:46,800
proprietary software vendors have taken

00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:48,690
every opportunity to point to any areas

00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,070
in open source as being a big problem

00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:52,230
and because they're open you can see

00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:55,290
them whilst there's a hidden is there

00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:57,210
any effort afoot to also take the pieces

00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,339
of closed source software that are being

00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:02,820
used by the Commission and get them also

00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:04,290
audited so that that they can't go

00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,640
saying I'll look at all these floors

00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:07,950
doesn't have you found an open source

00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,010
there are then faced with the well yeah

00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:13,349
and look at yours which um yeah they're

00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:15,869
not as easy to deal with are they right

00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:19,530
I have to admit I have not thought of

00:55:15,869 --> 00:55:21,680
that at all but I am thinking about it

00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,680
now

00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:34,770
thank you very much

00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:57,610
thank you very very much what an

00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:57,610
inspiring weekend we had haven't we

00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:09,550
I hope you guys have she had a lot of

00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:12,310
ideas she had some software Eric had

00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:15,070
shared his flu with me so before we

00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:20,020
carry on I would like to invite Katie up

00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:23,650
here they will be a move they will be

00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:25,780
doing their Academy Award so I expect a

00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:31,839
lot of film starts to come up here by

00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:34,480
now oh that's our first film star okay

00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:37,089
yeah tradition time so it's the year of

00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,280
Academy again and I have to honor this

00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:41,920
year to give out the Academy Awards to

00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,800
people that have contributed a lot of

00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,200
good work to the KDE community and we

00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,150
will start with the non-application

00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,849
contribution award which has been

00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:53,890
decided by this year's jury to go to a

00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:57,690
leash pole for his continued work

00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:57,690
throughout all of KDE

00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:13,680
thanks a lot man you could have gotten

00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:17,760
lots of developer awards as well but we

00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,740
thought this one was good so then we

00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,110
continue with I think the application

00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:24,240
award which goes to something what we

00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:26,700
thought it's kind of odd that they

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:30,120
didn't ever get the price so far and

00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,830
this year the award goes to piss off

00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:35,930
Coleman and Dominic common for their

00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:35,930
work on k text editor k right and cake

00:57:48,450 --> 00:58:04,300
how long has it been 15 years your time

00:57:55,089 --> 00:58:07,119
has come Thanks you got it one and then

00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:10,359
the jury thought that the jury award

00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:13,300
goes to another developer and actually

00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:15,460
on the whole community it's actually

00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:17,829
this year for Daniel rattle and the I

00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:20,170
other Katie pimp stirs for his work and

00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:22,450
they work on Acra naughty and keeping

00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:25,500
our mail safe so thanks a lot Daniel

00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,500
where are you come up

00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:45,020
thank you then and last but not least of

00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:47,240
course we want to thank and please

00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:57,830
award for our your work on actually

01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,829
contributing to the projects

01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:11,729
we had our first F is a visa made here

01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:13,559
at cute con and I think it was a big

01:03:11,729 --> 01:03:16,769
success given the good feedback I've

01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:19,619
heard which is also due to the very good

01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:23,309
cooperation that we had here among us

01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:25,109
organizers of the communities that makes

01:03:23,309 --> 01:03:29,459
me happy but when it makes me even more

01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:32,309
happy is when I heard that fellows from

01:03:29,459 --> 01:03:35,089
the FSF ye political activists were

01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:37,890
joining developers meeting here and

01:03:35,089 --> 01:03:42,359
developers were joining our political

01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:43,890
talks and also how I became aware that

01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:46,019
there are a lot of people here inside to

01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:50,069
contribute to more than one community

01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:53,819
who are part of F is a VN of KDE or end

01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:57,299
of VLC and this makes me really happy

01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:59,189
and I hope that we can have this a

01:03:57,299 --> 01:04:00,539
similar thing in the future I think it

01:03:59,189 --> 01:04:03,109
was a very good thing for all of our

01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:03,109
communities

01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:19,640
so one of the hopes we had when we

01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:21,800
started this journey was that you guys

01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,390
would not just go to your own so the

01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:27,530
kiddie developers go to their KD

01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:29,960
meetings and so on so we've been talking

01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:32,450
a lot about so did people do that so I

01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,250
would like you to be completely quiet if

01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:36,410
you didn't go to anybody's other talk

01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:38,090
clap a bit if you went to some of the

01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:40,310
other talks kept a bit harder if you

01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:43,720
went to quite a few of talks outside of

01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:43,720
your own domain so can I hear you

01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:49,060
awesome

01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:55,090
we can clap our own shoulders up here as

01:04:53,619 --> 01:04:57,880
long as we want but this wouldn't have

01:04:55,090 --> 01:05:00,400
happened if it hadn't been for the more

01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,349
than 140 people who volunteer to do

01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,330
presentations here so should we all

01:05:02,349 --> 01:05:07,530
please give those hand a big hand for

01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:07,530
for doing this

01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:21,690
it would neither happened it if it

01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:24,530
hadn't been for those people that had

01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:27,510
spent their last three days sitting

01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:30,150
running the camera sitting in booth

01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:31,980
sitting in front of the presentation at

01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:34,560
present at us and making sure that they

01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:36,300
would shut up on time so anybody who

01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:40,590
volunteered during those three days

01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:42,770
could you please stand up quite a few of

01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:42,770
those

01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:58,360
so last but not least I want to hear how

01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:01,870
many a few minutes to go to all the

01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:03,100
talks of this conference okay to see if

01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:06,160
there was somebody starting clubbing

01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:07,960
there again the good news is that a lot

01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:10,870
of those talk has been recorded already

01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:13,090
so if you go to the acute Condor talk

01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:15,040
page then at the front page you will

01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:16,990
find a link or find a number of links to

01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:19,360
where you can find those talks that you

01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:21,850
missed you can also find the slides if

01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,560
you click on a presenter or click on a

01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:25,840
talk that you can find the slide as soon

01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:28,600
as the presenter remembers to upload his

01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:32,020
slides so let that be a reminder to the

01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:34,510
presenters and finally I'm afraid to say

01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:37,710
this is over now have a pleasant trip

01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:37,710
