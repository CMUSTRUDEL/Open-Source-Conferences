welcome here at QT Khan Academy to my

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,980
talk about PR for open source projects

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,080
in free to interrupt me feel free to

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,330
correct me feel free to tell me that I'm

telling stupid stupid things this is

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,269
just a collection of stuff I learned in

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:30,420
some almost 20 years in linux and open

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,180
source stuff I've done this I've given

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,210
this talk some several times and it's

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,340
growing so I'm happy for an input so

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,710
feel free to interrupt me my name is

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,370
Marcus varna I'm Tim Dean at sushiya

team lead for documentation at Suzie and

00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:48,120
before that I have been I had been

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,670
working for about eight years as

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,840
episodes journalist as journalists as a

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:59,219
tree knocks magazine Germany always

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:03,270
biased always pro open source and so I

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:08,250
think I learned this is this phone okay

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:11,070
double so I think I can yeah I learned

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,200
some lessons and I that I'd like to

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:20,070
share and that many open-source projects

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,750
need and so here we go I am as I said I

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,119
was a journalist before but now I'm a

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:29,490
sort of a lizard a green one and I'm

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,890
some words about me I sort of have this

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,439
strange hobby that I'm collecting some

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,299
things like I'm a priest collecting

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,070
titles maybe I'm a priest for the

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,290
Universal Life Church so if you need me

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,020
for marriages or divorce or whatever

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,880
just feel free to talk to me I'm a

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,060
diplomat for the Conch Republic which is

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,149
a not recognized or not accepted island

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,649
Republic in the Florida Keys I own some

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,759
property on the moon and I magida a

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,140
night and yes I've been writing lots and

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,090
lots of pages and stuff for this

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,969
magazine here which is the oldest print

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:08,520
magazine about linux on this planet and

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:11,610
then last year in march i switched the

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,080
side and i went to Susie in nuremberg

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,380
linux distributor

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,390
and when I came there I I came to the

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,810
museum and then what what I saw in the

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,460
museum was exactly that kind of Linux

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,410
that was my first linux that i had

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:30,030
installed this one was not I I had even

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,790
one version before that because that is

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,060
the cd-rom version of Suzy I had a

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:39,180
friend who came and brought me some 50

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,010
or 40 floppy disks and then we had a

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,580
funny night and the next day I did not

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,800
know what to do but now i'm working at

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,410
Suzy and what I'm I'm in charge of the

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,070
team that writes the documentation my

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:56,880
team maintains about 11,000 pages of

00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:59,400
documentation and well that's including

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,340
all documentation that has been written

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,580
for all the versions of our software but

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,880
it's quite a lot so team is about 10 to

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,780
13 people but yeah soon it will be 13

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,090
people and you all that do everything

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:20,760
that we write is new free documentation

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:23,550
license so let's now go into this

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,010
workshop I've done this workshop for the

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,410
first time at academy in tampere which I

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,870
just learned this five six seven or

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,650
eight years ago it was in 2009 or

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:38,370
something like that we think so 2010 Wow

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:41,070
and we did this for a whole day with

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,900
active contribution from the people so

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,970
if you have questions if you have a

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,980
project that or a question about your

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,090
project really interrupt me ask me I

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,330
sort of condensed it for this half hour

00:03:51,090 --> 00:04:01,910
45 minutes one hour we will see how long

00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:04,650
we take for this presentation will have

00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,350
this is I call this a mini workshop and

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,150
what I'll tell you about is about basics

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,570
benefits of project promotion which is

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,950
rather obvious but it's quite good to

00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,750
hear about it again because it may be

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,570
arguments when you argue with people who

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,549
say now PR is ugly we don't like the arm

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,789
whatever then you may need some

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:26,680
arguments to convince them and I will

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:30,669
tell you about project descriptions

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,009
avoiding type was obviously not and what

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,740
things like elevator pitches are and

00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:37,419
I'll give you some suggestions for

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:41,530
website for videos for how to dealing

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:44,949
with the ugly press and about direct

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:47,320
outreach tabling at conferences and how

00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:50,080
to write announcements articles blogs

00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,789
and dealing with social media and those

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,500
 emotions oops did I really say

00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:55,500
that no i didn't i didn't say it loud

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,919
promotion for your promoting your

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:06,130
project is I mean I this is telling the

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:09,930
obvious I think it should bring more

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:14,349
users which again should bring more

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:17,710
ideas new features new ideas or also

00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:21,639
tell you about bugs in your soft and you

00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,979
software project you will hopefully get

00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,910
more developers which I learned is an

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:30,039
issue for KDE for example but you also

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,810
gain gain with more users you also gain

00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,539
more translators designers artists

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,210
packages advocates everything I told you

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:41,110
this is basic so it's about growing your

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:46,800
community and it's also about getting in

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:49,330
touch with other communities and finding

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,710
new intersections maybe with other

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:55,659
projects for that for stuff like that

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,759
one of the most important things that

00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,199
you need for a project for it let's

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,479
think for a new project is a project

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,380
description what does it do what is it

00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:09,669
and that in for use in multiple contexts

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,740
something like one or two sentences it

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:15,490
should focus on what the user sees it

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,919
should focus on user experience don't go

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:21,159
down too much in details it's just about

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,289
one or two sentences and it should help

00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:25,630
someone unfit with unfamiliar with the

00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:29,320
project to get a sense what it is and

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:32,610
what it does very basic again and it

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,379
should be written

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:38,430
the fact in mind that this is something

00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:42,169
that could appear everywhere in your

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:50,449
project in communications on the website

00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:53,460
for example someone still knows G blur

00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:58,229
so that's a project description that

00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:04,819
pretty obviously doesn't work or do you

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:09,529
think what do you think first sentence

00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:18,569
that's mean I'm keibler iphone straight

00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:21,710
floors in the years uh-huh uh-huh but if

00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:24,779
you don't know about image the

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,419
publishing or picture rendering or

00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:31,050
whatever then people some user won't

00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:33,810
know what it does I think all thank you

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,229
Pisan is not relevant I guess if it's

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,310
for them that's a good point i think

00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,830
that might be interesting for the

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,110
developer but it's too i think it's just

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:48,599
too complicated and it's it if you don't

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:51,000
know anything about the about the the

00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:53,310
image processing i think the second

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,830
example is better it's a Python script

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:58,229
ok yeah that's good for the developers

00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:01,560
it applies a blurring technique to raw

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:03,800
photos Gaussian blur that's so far in I

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,500
think it's not really that important but

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:15,150
it's in the SEC it that deference in the

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:18,629
second sentence and we eliminated the

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:26,930
IRL go algorithm just as an example try

00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:29,219
to be easy and simple what you also need

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,529
these these deaths deaths are three

00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:33,209
kinds of these short descriptions for

00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:35,190
your project that the project

00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,380
description is what will appear

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,300
everywhere on websites and then you have

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,069
an elevator pitch in kitchen calls these

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,630
are terms elevator pitches from

00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:46,010
marketing and kitchen call is from

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,010
journalism the

00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:53,450
the elevator pitch is something that

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,450
imagine you are in an elevator with the

00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:00,140
the super rich CEO and you want him to

00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,000
spend money into your project that's the

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,440
classical marketing senior so you have

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,820
30 seconds and you have to explain the

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,400
whole of your project and convince him

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,710
why he should open his pocket and it

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,620
burned pour the millions on you so

00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,700
that's a very short sentence on yeah we

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,620
are doing that and that and that and

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,940
that is really cool and that's why we

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:22,040
will be totally successful whereas a

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:24,560
kitchen call is something the

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,110
journalists will know it's something

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,260
that really is one sentence that

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:32,450
describes the whole article in

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:35,630
journalism for example yeah so that the

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:38,300
elevator pitch is to consume too has the

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,310
intention to convince somebody of doing

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:45,730
something whereas the the kitchen call

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:48,560
is just the altar most dentists summary

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:55,400
KDE desktop environment with lots of

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:59,810
applications can I say it shorter is

00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:02,360
everything in so just think of the

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,980
shortest possible ways are there's three

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,620
different thing the project description

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,480
is longer two sentences is universal the

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,390
elevator pitch is to convince somebody

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,270
to do something and the the kitchen call

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:20,089
would be just as as reduced to the max

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:25,640
as possible reduce to the max and tell

00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:30,150
the story yeah

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:35,810
what's peculiar about your project in

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:43,320
one sentence I put me on fring easy

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:46,260
uh-huh okay that's that's like that's a

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:51,840
kitchen call so now convince me why

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:54,900
should I do that in two sentences yeah

00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,490
that's the elevator pitch the project

00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,350
description would now take this kitchen

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,870
call and make two paragraphs or

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:03,900
something like that out of that for the

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:08,550
uninitiated so maybe you would want to

00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:10,800
explain what bsd is in three words huh

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,710
so and I think these three things these

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,200
these these three short the shorter some

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:19,890
element gets in when working with words

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:23,940
the more difficult it is the word the

00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:30,900
worst form of wordings in journalism is

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:32,310
headings and captions 444 images because

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:40,290
you don't you have a limited amount of

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:47,370
space and that's why this is interesting

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:50,100
I saw so you need this stuff for your

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,230
website which has general information

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:58,590
about your project but it should be

00:11:52,230 --> 00:12:01,080
written for a newbie my opinion news on

00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:04,140
your website will always be good make

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,660
sure that it's individually linkable so

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,400
that each news each news item I think

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,250
WordPress does that for example does all

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,810
modern CMS do that automatically that

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,710
you can link it and that people can link

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:18,480
and send it or post it and share it but

00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,190
one very important thing that many

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,950
open-source projects fail to do is

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:27,060
provide a press page for the media and

00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,910
define at least a single person

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,650
responsible for press contacts we have

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,450
community managers and other stuff but

00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,320
just one person or even better is a

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:39,830
group a press team

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,650
if your team if your if your project is

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:45,530
big enough you can do 2407 just by

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:49,250
timezone things yes if you have five six

00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:51,410
people in a group whatever but that's

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,740
just because most journalists can't wait

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,630
they are they have so much work in so

00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,150
much in so little and very little time

00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:00,620
for it so they mostly when they have the

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:03,140
when they realize they need some

00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,750
information about your project then they

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,300
might need it in the next two hours or

00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:12,560
something like that that's I've done

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:15,530
this job so that's my experience a press

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,120
team will be the number one address for

00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:20,810
your journalists for journalists

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:24,560
contacting your project that will

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:26,600
identify it will actively so it's the

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,400
number one contact and incoming stuff

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,370
but it also will be it should be

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,310
actively communicating identifying

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:37,390
important media making lists constantly

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,610
blogging plussing and sharing and

00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:43,310
preparing contact for the press content

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:46,910
for the press I will tell you what a

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:48,470
press kit is and it will keep the

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,320
depressed team is in charge of keeping

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,720
the press kit up to date on the website

00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:59,720
and it will run something like the press

00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:01,370
at your project org mailing list when

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,320
you're talking to the press when they

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:07,670
are talking to the press there's some

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:10,910
little caveats the Americans will have

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,190
heard of the vice president under under

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,770
lyndon b johnson in the 60s hubert

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:19,430
humphrey he said it's always a risk to

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:24,950
speak to the press they might publish

00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:26,780
what you say and it's important when you

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:30,350
talk to the press give them hard news

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:33,080
hard facts that that's all that's again

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,940
marketing and PR stuff it's about hard

00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,740
news it's about facts journalists one

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,840
concentrated facts no big babbling

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,910
around so if when i met people like

00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,650
politicians or whatever there's people

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,600
way you don't start talking to them

00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,080
anymore because you know it will take

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,180
half an hour at least to get one answer

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,980
hard facts is appreciated by journalists

00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,440
what they appreciate is thought

00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,870
leadership if you have people who who

00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:01,790
have a vision and who are sort of way

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:03,170
ahead and can articulate that and then

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,880
the next very important thing is

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,930
relationship building so talk to the

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,420
people meet them invite them build up a

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:14,779
personal relationship then you will have

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:18,290
you will be able to get a mutual trust

00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:20,779
situation well then then the risk you

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,339
can minimize this risk about having them

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:23,839
told something that the other guy in

00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:33,560
your project doesn't want the press to

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:39,320
know yet so that's another just side

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:41,209
aspect journalist you will have to do

00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,390
with mischievous / suspicious

00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:49,010
journalists I think that you won't tell

00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:55,490
them the truth when especially when

00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:58,730
things go wrong there is a saying or in

00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:01,940
ham's razor or Hanlon's razor they call

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:07,430
this never attribute to malice which is

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:09,200
adequately explained by stupidity so the

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,490
journalists will come up to you and tell

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,740
you there's something significantly

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,450
going wrong here and you have to tell

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,810
them no no no we're just a stupid bunch

00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:20,540
and this is ah yeah things like that

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,180
quotes like that and help in such

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,800
situations to convince them and that

00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,330
means that's also when you have this

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,400
personal relationship with those guys

00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,080
you can be open and frank about to them

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,730
and take them aside and say okay listen

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,490
this is not for the public but this is

00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,020
not what happened and they will believe

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,240
you if once you have this personal

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,550
relationship for this personal

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,709
relationship the press team should I

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,770
said that before collect the Preston

00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:48,230
sort of a press distribution list a list

00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:51,410
with press people on it that are

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,329
interested in your project or media the

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:57,200
media contacts that are interested in

00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:59,660
this in this project that can be it is a

00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,150
simple list no big tools required you

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,800
can have a as a pet Vicky or on a

00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,510
mailing list or whatever

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,449
but start making a list of people that

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,370
are tech journalists are related or

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:14,329
other multipliers that other people that

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:15,679
you know they talk to journalists then

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,270
ask them if they are fine with you

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,530
sending them use of new versions and

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:25,189
stuff and keep the signal-to-noise ratio

00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:28,040
lo that's very important journalists you

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:31,520
tend to get tens or hundreds of

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:34,400
newsletters a day so if you sent them

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,350
too many they will not focus on them

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,110
will prob are more likely to not read

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:43,309
them if you send them less but more

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:47,870
relevant information that chances are

00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:49,730
higher that they read it but you have to

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:56,059
find that out journalists are different

00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:57,740
there and how to find that out is easy

00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:02,030
if you talk to other open source

00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:04,160
projects I've as a journalist I have

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,300
talked to prod whatever project that

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,040
hope ya have you heard what they do

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,620
that's really cool have a look at that

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,110
and that's a synergy that the open

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,660
source world has among the projects and

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,640
then you can ask you-know-who to address

00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,880
you I can ask adriana and ask him hey

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,590
and one I want to publish something in

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,120
Holland up in Netherlands or whatever

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,070
when England do you have a contact there

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:33,470
who am I to address there and he may

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:36,320
know somebody basic and invite us I'm

00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,929
not I'm only I met Susie now but invite

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,750
us in right the journalists to events to

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:44,600
discussions whatever i was at academy as

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,570
a journalist I i came to some KDE

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,669
sprints i was interested in KDE pim

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,860
development event to katie pimps prince

00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:53,390
we're only 20 or 30 people were there of

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,910
KDA only developers i was the only

00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:58,010
journalist they were like that's the

00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,620
first time a journalist is here but they

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:02,630
told me about it and i think then it was

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,820
been hot right as long a long ago who

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,020
said that that's something happening so

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,370
we're doing some amazing stuff you

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,910
should come and have a look at that and

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:15,080
I wrote an article on it that's it's

00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:17,540
really cool let's contact them in

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:26,310
interviews

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:29,310
there is again it's important to focus

00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:32,210
on differences of what is different what

00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:35,100
has changed what is what are we doing

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,860
new what is what is new improved other

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,660
different mind also the difference

00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,310
between the journalists approach in your

00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,010
approach so they may not be that deep

00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,290
into the matter and they want to focus

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,630
on relevance so there may be stuff that

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,190
that you think is very very important

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,720
but which is journalist either just

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,830
doesn't doesn't get or doesn't think

00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:02,130
it's that important they have a

00:19:52,830 --> 00:20:04,380
different aspect of it and you want to

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:06,540
these four items difference relevance

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,000
and credibility and vision you want

00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,460
these D these four things as as an

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,590
impression in the in the press you want

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,990
to after the interview want you want to

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:20,040
have told them that your project is

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:24,270
different is new or different that it's

00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:28,290
important that what you're doing is a

00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:30,630
good thing is sustainable and that you

00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:32,400
have a vision that goes beyond this the

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,140
current state that's why I have these

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,070
four points here difference relevance

00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,840
credibility and vision so what does your

00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,760
company do what is it different what's

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,470
the most important then you need

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,300
communication skills or just find

00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,890
somebody with communication skills to

00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:52,440
convince and to to be credible and this

00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,850
these guys they have to have active

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:59,330
mirror neurons have you heard of that

00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:01,470
concept in the head okay when you're

00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,550
talking to somebody when you're looking

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,710
at somebody when you're looking at

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,080
pictures in your brain in our brain

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:11,760
there's some there's some part in our

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,880
brain who like like it's like in the

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,070
cinema in a movie like mirrors what's

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,780
happening in the other guy that you're

00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,880
talking to so if you're watching people

00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,320
of self if you're watching photos of

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,760
some people laughing a little part of

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,250
your brain will be laughing if you're

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,260
watching photos of somebody who has who

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,900
is crying a little part of your brain is

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,250
crying

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,800
something that's automatically you

00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,290
cannot prevent that but there is people

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,090
who are more skilled with this and can

00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,770
actively use this and that is what we

00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,380
meet what that is a large part of

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,240
empathy understanding what's happening

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,880
in somebody else I look at you and I

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,560
ever may have an understanding what's

00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,120
what's right now happening in you

00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,490
something like what the is he

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,680
talking about me now and what whatever

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,720
so but that's important for interview

00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,810
situations that you also see basically

00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,610
again just see that the journalist is in

00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,250
some completely different spheres now

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,660
and has some completely different

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,780
interest or is not interested in what

00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:10,210
you're saying anymore you have to focus

00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,790
focus on the on the facts on the central

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:16,170
things and not talk about some there

00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:18,400
some holiday that you did years ago and

00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:21,100
you have to listen and build bridges

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,340
between your topics and their topics

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:27,700
then is for Venn diagrams I'll have one

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:30,130
later it just it's just a nice tool to

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,770
that you can use within it within a

00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:35,050
discussion to find out is this still my

00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,910
topic and we are we talking about what I

00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,310
have to say are we talking what this guy

00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:44,230
has to say I'll have a diagram for that

00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:48,010
and then there is the thing with the

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:49,660
first impression I have the first

00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,780
impression that you give to somebody is

00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:55,150
very important but nevertheless it's not

00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,370
the only impression that you leave with

00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:59,350
somebody especially in times of

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:04,540
multimedia with photos or video

00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:06,670
recordings or whatever I am I try to

00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,740
play with the first impressions and

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,990
giving people a wrong first impression

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,600
of me because it's fun to see what

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,120
happens afterwards it's just some

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,000
hacking thing maybe whatever that I like

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,620
to do but it's important when you're

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,660
talking to interviews to press people

00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,670
then it's important to try to give a

00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:31,690
good first impression and remember what

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:33,610
you said I already

00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:38,529
that connect with journalists also on

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:41,019
social media the journalists will get it

00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:42,940
the interview situation you will get a

00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,409
press kit the press kit should but

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,830
should also be available on the website

00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:49,750
if you can print it or make a make a

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,460
folder with some stuff if you have the

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,659
resources to do that that's fine and you

00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,519
have something to give to the

00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:59,649
journalists and they'll appreciate that

00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,480
it should be on the website downloadable

00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:03,460
and the press team should be in charge

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,909
of it and take care of it what should it

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:11,590
contain I just can't contain of course

00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:13,899
the project description what is it and a

00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:16,629
guided tour to through the best and

00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:18,820
newest features for somebody who has no

00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:21,789
clue about anything about your project

00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,669
huh therefore if it's a graphical

00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:26,529
programmer then you should add

00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:29,379
screenshots take care of the license

00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:31,870
this is very important it has to be some

00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:33,309
kind of free license not commercial so

00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,549
that the journalists can use those

00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:37,899
screenshots in publications otherwise

00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:39,129
they will have to set it up their own

00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:53,950
and do their own screen Justin that's

00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:56,769
easier yeah so NC is dead noncommercial

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,059
is dead in my opinion so we couldn't at

00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:01,110
lenox magazine we could not use

00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:03,789
Wikipedia photos Wikimedia photos

00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:08,429
wikipedia which is Wikimedia mediawiki

00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:11,830
photos so I photos from Wikipedia

00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:13,899
because they used to be non-commercial

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,480
license and then for I think it took

00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:18,580
them five years to to remove all NC

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,519
content and now there is only CC content

00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:24,240
because there's also court rulings about

00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,409
NC NC is not specified it's not

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,240
specified there is in at least i think

00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:32,139
in europe it's not specified which is

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:35,019
commercial use when you run a blog yeah

00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:37,179
and you earn 20 euro per year with ads

00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:38,410
on that block is that commercial use or

00:25:37,179 --> 00:25:42,520
not

00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:53,710
it's too difficult so what's happening

00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:56,440
here I'm having a pop-up thankful thanks

00:25:53,710 --> 00:26:00,160
that you didn't see it they're not know

00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,080
non non commercial that's just just CC

00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,130
that's okay I mean you're not earning

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:10,720
money with the screenshots so they're

00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:13,180
not real assets and again the press

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,310
contact phone mail instant messaging

00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,980
facebook google+ whatever when the press

00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:21,220
needs something they will need it fast

00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:25,750
and that's exposed exposure this person

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:31,630
this team is exposed that's their job at

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:33,400
your website just see yep helpful items

00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,560
at your website for journalists is the

00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,060
news archive so that when I go there I

00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,380
can just grab through okay what was the

00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,840
last things that happened and since when

00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:44,020
is this feature then I can in my news i

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:48,520
can write and since 2007 day they

00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:49,930
introduce that blah blah blah and so i'm

00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,630
already in the middle of the projects

00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:55,770
history that should be there a list of

00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:58,810
distributions package in your software

00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:01,000
so how to get a list of major

00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,770
dependencies if like we had with the g

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,240
blur thing that's a Python script was

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,880
already in the prescription so i can

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,970
think okay I may have to install Python

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,750
if I don't have it if I want to use it

00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:15,880
and also events you plan to attend and

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:19,480
how and where journalists can meet and

00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:22,840
contact you there may be links to

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,930
related projects you may get return

00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,330
links from them and of course if you

00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:31,120
have any documentation install guide

00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:35,350
quick install and information about what

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,270
help is needed again you have to expose

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,860
yourself if you want to do PR and if you

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,860
want to do the press about your project

00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,750
ideally you have a team of people who

00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:48,750
are ready to say okay yes I stand for

00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:51,640
this project I'm running this project

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,990
you can show like well que te does

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,210
pretty well with the court with the

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,340
Academy and the Academy photos of all

00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,320
the participants so show the major

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,470
contributors leaders and advocates that

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,450
drive to project if you want put put

00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:08,049
some biographies photos or links to

00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:12,130
their blogs and social media links there

00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:16,570
I know this is a controversy topic but

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:18,100
it's for PR it's necessary and let them

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,350
talk about why and how they started the

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:24,250
project everybody loves to hear and read

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:26,950
such stories the one I think few people

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:30,690
like to write it but everybody loves to

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:30,690
read it so why does he do that stuff

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:39,669
press rooms on the website if your

00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,950
project is bigger you may want the press

00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:45,960
room the room not only a press site and

00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:48,940
press room for the that's a special

00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,650
realm of sides of links for the press

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,150
with press kit and all that stuff inside

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,640
so if it's bigger if you have more to

00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:57,250
tell and the longer history that's what

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,620
big companies do very important don't

00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:02,110
require registration just make it open

00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,000
for everybody because registration is

00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:06,040
again a hassle for the journalists are

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,400
I've got a password yeah somewhere

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:12,010
whatever it's just a hurdle to get in

00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,840
there if you have a press room with a

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:15,490
lot with lots of information provide a

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,580
quick search through the material you

00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,140
have their link to the your fa queues

00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,960
and documentation and stuff that you

00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:28,980
have and have a look at how big

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,980
companies do that do I have Wi-Fi here

00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,950
see

00:29:41,730 --> 00:30:08,370
so for example steak firefox here yep

00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:16,890
see if I Wi-Fi I didn't check the vice

00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:38,750
now there's data come in yeah that's

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,720
what

00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:46,400
doing I thought it's interesting where

00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:57,670
do I get redirected Vodafone free Wi-Fi

00:30:46,400 --> 00:31:11,830
a nice who's there that doesn't it that

00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:11,830
okay now i'm on the Qt let's see again

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:25,490
so you see Microsoft has a huge that's

00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:28,400
all newsroom and press stuff here from

00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,900
Microsoft the highlights and that's all

00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,520
stuff that Microsoft writes for the

00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,230
press and they have press tools they

00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:44,540
have press contacts press release and

00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:46,280
lots and lots of stuff and Google I all

00:31:44,540 --> 00:32:04,280
ahead all of this open in the browser

00:31:46,280 --> 00:32:05,080
but I had to reboot yes see yeah this is

00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,130
good

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:13,030
a little bit less intrusive or a little

00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:17,740
simpler design taking my mouse it will

00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:22,690
be easier for its website but you can

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:30,550

00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,320
google+ you have the twitter resources

00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,940
there's everything that you need

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:41,740
microsoft obviously focus more focuses

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:43,270
more on getting on under visual on the

00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:47,410
images and Google is more focused on the

00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:49,960
information now when you look at how

00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:51,580
Souza and redhead do that let's have

00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:56,860
Susie and this will be fast enough

00:32:51,580 --> 00:33:00,810
because now I have the she's a

00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:05,470
journalist she's fine no visual so our

00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:08,530
vigils how do I didn't understand that

00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:11,890
what you mean that's a few on Google

00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:14,110
would you have the feeling like I also

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:17,530
have to figure out the bridges myself

00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:19,900
their own story up this I would prefer

00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:21,910
the google version definitely because I

00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,590
am faster to where I want to go i have

00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:27,010
the press at google com email address

00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:28,480
right there it's I i feel i think the

00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:31,120
microsoft site is a little bit bloated

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,780
from mike taste with visuals and stuff

00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,450
but that's what they want they they they

00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,920
want to tell their story whereas i would

00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:45,700
say google is an example for more

00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:47,470
content focused huh so and the main

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,780
information is this is the official

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,580
google blog with the date with the news

00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,990
that they had that I think it here is

00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,930
the media contacts despot that's

00:33:52,990 --> 00:34:03,160
basically what I as a journalist would

00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:07,210
want when I go there I think so this is

00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:09,550
Susie and I think we are doing quite

00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:13,270
fine there as well as at least when I'm

00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:14,980
if I'm Sebastian if I ask you when you

00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:18,380
go when you're journalist you go to a

00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:21,230
website of a company would you

00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:24,620
would you I I was just asked because

00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:27,200
this is the Microsoft newsroom lots of

00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:29,810
images and i would i would rather prefer

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,540
this that the the style that google has

00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:50,660
with only information and a quick way to

00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:52,970
press people and stuff so right it's

00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:56,680
interesting cuz i mean as a small team a

00:34:52,970 --> 00:35:17,480
cab also create all these images is a

00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:19,550
lot of work that's signal-to-noise ratio

00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,110
again see google they don't have a news

00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:27,860
in their blog every day here yeah i mean

00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:30,280
that the day a huge but they have august

00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:33,770
15 august 24 august twenty five

00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,510
wednesday 31 and there may be other

00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,550
stuff and blogs and social media but

00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:41,150
that's linked and that's pretty focused

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:45,250
i would say and i also think that that

00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:48,590
Souza is doing that pretty much the same

00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:53,810
even less I think that's about 2 News

00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:55,880
per month huh in the newsroom you have

00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:59,810
the search engine here the main thing

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:10,960
and every news is individually linkable

00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:18,230
I want to see let's see I can see that

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:22,150
did I spell it right opensuse let it

00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,150
slow in the meantime

00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:43,250
redhead press so this is the opposite

00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:47,180
side which is in my opinion also it's

00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:49,520
optimized for tablets it's it's it's

00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:55,430
it's cool but it's it's also difficult

00:36:49,520 --> 00:37:01,430
to find stuff here I think yeah here's

00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:04,040
where you find stuff but and news but I

00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:08,839
don't think this is the best one whereas

00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:19,670
Google coming go ahead it's looking for

00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:23,500
redhead here they have also got their

00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:32,380
own newsroom and while this is loading

00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:32,380
I'm taking the as an example from here

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:58,369
KDE so this is redheads press room this

00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:02,800
is sort of a mixture i would say yeah

00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:06,380
it's pretty much visual but here is the

00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:09,320
news also pretty clear they have a

00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,510
search engine here you can filter you

00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,470
have options on how to present it but

00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:21,230
it's but also text focus information

00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:23,530
focus you find stuff there KDE press

00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,530
page

00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:35,339
offers the story information on KDE so

00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:37,890
that's the basics but there's for

00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:40,410
example no link to news or am I wrong

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:45,869
did they add one last time I look there

00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:54,480
was no where is it I don't see it am I

00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:58,349
wrong huh it's not from this press page

00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:07,619
but if you go to the home hey yeah then

00:38:58,349 --> 00:39:13,530
you'll have a link to news yep right got

00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:31,260
it so and let's compare that to be gnome

00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:34,770
dot org slash press right which doesn't

00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:51,480
load is it blocked but spelled it

00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:58,730
correctly think so i think it's use the

00:39:51,480 --> 00:40:03,089
Wi-Fi Winslow should I does this work

00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:04,920
but this does this work anybody knows if

00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:09,510
the what the LAN works oh there it is

00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:14,520
see no press page spot the difference

00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:17,010
the news in the front yeah they have

00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,569
then they have technologies about us but

00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:20,900
that's also that's so that's the press

00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:20,900
page

00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:32,859
but this doesn't have any of the other

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:35,830
story history and some six months that

00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:46,660
is all here under about us technologies

00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:57,730
and stuff yeah that's another thing it's

00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:59,560
constant work so as Rick yes so we had

00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:03,520
the press rooms as examples I don't have

00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:06,369
red head and now the summary is make it

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,440
easy think of journalists as someone

00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:11,410
completely new to your software we don't

00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,750
know they want to get the most

00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,310
information they want to get the most

00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,820
information possible in a very short

00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:21,700
time they want to contact you give them

00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,200
the chance to succeed they need material

00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:27,849
for their article give them a press kit

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,670
with screenshots and stuff make it easy

00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:32,320
for you users to given you use as an

00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,750
easy way to start giving you uses an

00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:38,369
easy way to get involved give all users

00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,369
links to the information they need and

00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:46,440
make it clear what your license is

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,060
explain where and how decisions are made

00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:53,830
that's all stuff that that the press

00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:56,530
also will need to tell the story about

00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:58,960
your project because the journalists

00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:00,849
will want to know nothing about your

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,160
project but they will write force people

00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,420
who equally don't know anything about

00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,310
your project but they might be

00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:10,900
interested in contributing and learning

00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:17,680
more so your press kit / website press

00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:20,349
work should be enabling new people one

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,260
thing that gets a lot of attention

00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:25,420
easily is videos if you can today

00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,430
everybody got a smartphone and the

00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,930
camera that does video and when I first

00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:31,089
held this speech there was something new

00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,640
where people would set up studios and

00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:36,290
stuff like that I had to remove what

00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,120
some of the funny videos

00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:40,430
because they're easier today they are

00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,230
not funny anymore that that different

00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:46,130
times or they are they are not available

00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:47,690
anymore but viral video charts they

00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,290
shall trends in good ideas there are

00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:53,270
some websites like viral videos com

00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:57,590
viral viral videos com where you can go

00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:59,810
and see or meme websites and whatever I

00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:01,280
learn how to make a clip and ask and

00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,590
colleagues and friends for contribution

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,390
and devastating criticism at the

00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,900
beginning it's hard but it's fun it can

00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:11,480
be really fun to do some stuff like that

00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:14,180
the that's what I said that time then

00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,970
video audio quality matters they met de

00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:21,140
matter use or set up a studio if you can

00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:24,140
the document management system dms a

00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:26,090
gorram they made them that would they

00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,790
made some of the example videos I had in

00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:31,460
here they were ridiculous because if you

00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:33,380
know the people like horse Broner from

00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:37,160
the city of schwäbisch Hall here in

00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:39,470
Germany in their office and they they

00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,120
did funny videos at for that time that

00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,770
was really cool and they they said they

00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,270
had set up equipment like here for that

00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:47,960
but today you can do stuff with

00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:50,900
smartphones as long as it isn't really

00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,520
really really bad quality you see more

00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,140
and more videos in social networks and

00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,840
whatever try to do stuff like that and

00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,820
ask friends and colleagues and be ready

00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,340
for devastating criticism they will tell

00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:03,200
you no you can't do that on stage and

00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:07,070
then you say supper did it and then they

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,690
say no whatever try and if you succeed

00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:11,660
that's really it's really cool and

00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:14,870
that's that's going to spread by itself

00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:16,760
yeah there's websites like no um mcom

00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,920
where you can go and look for memes

00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,110
which are currently trending and two and

00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,960
other and stuff and you can combine that

00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:25,220
maybe with your stuff just try it it may

00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,080
be fun and that's one thing if you

00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:33,830
succeed that's really really cool for

00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:36,800
for the project yeah fun sex edgy stuff

00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:40,940
is what works what was the last video

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,430
did you send around that's that's what

00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,440
works

00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:47,810
there are how to's how to kill your

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,780
viral video including do's and don'ts

00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:54,520
around this presentation will be shared

00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:57,980
I think as far as I even heard so I

00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,720
didn't and this is a this is a really

00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,330
good how to on as old but it's still

00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:04,880
good and one of the main sentences out

00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,800
of that is don't be the judge think of

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,560
your audience so just because you don't

00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,420
like some particular things your

00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:16,250
audience may like it to ask people talk

00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:18,170
with people they will tell you going

00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,930
back from from videos and viral stuff

00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:23,840
going back to direct outreach you may

00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:26,119
want to present your project on at

00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:31,400
conferences or in schools or at meetups

00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:33,619
or at nerd talks whatever how do you do

00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:37,910
that how do you reach that go to people

00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:39,590
ask them most of them are happy to not

00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,970
is it doesn't have to be the call for

00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,910
papers for a presentation for

00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:45,830
presentation like here most mostly it's

00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:48,050
a matter of asking and the hackerspace

00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,850
or the school or whatever just talk to

00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:52,490
people ask them they they are mostly

00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:54,800
happy to have some people telling them

00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:58,040
hey I got a cool thing and I want to

00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,600
talk about it and after the third time

00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,600
you'll have a working presentation

00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:07,570
research your target and your pitch

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:10,820
elevator pitch remember specifically so

00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:12,650
tell get the story tell when you're in a

00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:16,820
school whatever ton think about what

00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:19,340
might the teacher be interested in then

00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:22,010
get feedback from them and proofreading

00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,240
help it's always the most important do

00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:27,980
you know it published early published

00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:29,450
often tabling at conferences in whatever

00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,280
something else you need to have

00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:34,070
logistics you have to have a booth set

00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,990
up you have to go settings oh yeah what

00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:37,880
do why do you go there what do you want

00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:40,220
to reach there what is the what you want

00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,320
to have they would just tell the people

00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:46,070
about your existence just be there or

00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,510
give I free ice cream to everybody who's

00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,640
going to be at the tables you need

00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:52,040
people that have to stand at the tables

00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,690
and even on the third day those people

00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,230
who are standing there on our board and

00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:59,710
tired they still have to have the smile

00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:04,510
ads marketing it's not nice but it

00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:09,580
should keep it positive so and what will

00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:12,040
you actually say things like hi greeting

00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:14,590
with eye contact at least I will okay

00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,900
that at least in Europe I was told in

00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:19,000
u.s. eye contact is being is being seen

00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,640
differently but in Europe eye contact

00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,380
asked questions asked about the people

00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:27,940
who come up to your booth ask them what

00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:33,100
do they do okay and respond listen to

00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:37,720
them and did you know the attention span

00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:39,540
of people is limited and it's getting

00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,890
smaller and smaller with social media

00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:44,830
you may have heard about the goldfish in

00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:46,570
the glass he only survives in the glass

00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:49,000
because he's got he said to have an

00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,800
attention span of something like 30

00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,600
seconds so he sees the world outside

00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,880
he's he's a living room and thanks ok

00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,800
this is pouring out have a swim and when

00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,520
he comes back he's like wow living room

00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,130
cool so don't overload people with

00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,930
information people can usually listen

00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,940
something like 20 seconds when you're

00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,520
talking longer than 20 seconds that the

00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:12,040
other one is slowly losing his interest

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,800
or losing his focus and it this time

00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,570
period is getting slower and slower but

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:21,210
that's part of why Trump has so much

00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:24,850
success in us because he's reduced stuff

00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:26,200
and then spot the right moment to bring

00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:28,570
up your goal if you're if it's

00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,910
appropriate and always try to close

00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,560
positively close a discussion positively

00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:35,200
because if the other guy goes away he'll

00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,090
have a good feeling it's bad to go away

00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:43,690
with a negative thing just try to find

00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:46,210
something positive bridging if you

00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:48,280
disagree on topics if you have this guy

00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:50,440
who is talking about gnome and your MKT

00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,869
eat and try to build bridges between

00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,790
yeah but both better than this other

00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:56,470
desktop or whatever try to build bridges

00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:59,740
or build bridges into another argument

00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:01,720
from your side so get away from the from

00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:04,210
the controversy get into the stuff that

00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:08,590
brings you together build bridges and on

00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,960
several layers writing stuff you will be

00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:13,900
I have some

00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,960
overview of the next pages you how to

00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,310
write press releases the press release

00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,350
the first press release was written

00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:24,760
after an accident train accident in

00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:26,800
Atlantic City and it can trigger your

00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:30,340
audience alert journalists to something

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,890
new don't do it too often signal to

00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,420
noise to noise I said that don't do it

00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,840
too often only when really interesting

00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:39,700
things happen the Venn diagram I've said

00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,980
that before if you talk to somebody for

00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:45,880
example on the phone make two circles

00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:47,590
yeah left circle is his thing that he

00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,750
wants to tell the right circle is maybe

00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:53,200
what you want to tell and then make dots

00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:56,170
on this paper during the conversation

00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,970
what you're talking about if is it in

00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:00,460
your realm or is it more or less he

00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:03,490
explaining about his mother or whatever

00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:05,140
and at the end of the conversation you

00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:07,690
should be most of the dots should be

00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:10,390
here then it was successful because you

00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:14,280
both have you agreed you talked about

00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:14,280
something that both of you interested

00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:22,900
otherwise you're boring people or you

00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:29,230
aboard relevance in a press release 5v

00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:37,180
five W's who what when where why that's

00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:40,630
relevant the inverted pyramid who what

00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:44,160
where when how at first important

00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:44,160
details next and then the background

00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:52,260
that's a standard in NPR in NY and

00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,260
writing and news release

00:50:52,770 --> 00:51:00,240
about three times is my true what where

00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:02,250
when how oh no it basically means most

00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,440
people still read the first thing and

00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:07,320
less and less people come to the to the

00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,870
end yeah so that the first thing has the

00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:14,250
biggest outreach Marco's father gave a

00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:20,430
speech at KD Academy and QT con 2016 who

00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:22,230
what where we're in Berlin yeah nobody's

00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:26,820
interested in that I've done this speech

00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:29,100
before you start with a lead that's the

00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,600
first sentence my lead is an opening

00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,860
sentence that's the that's the most

00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,690
important thing that's what everybody

00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:35,270
reads and they decide by this first

00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:38,460
sentence if they should read on or not

00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:40,320
it gets the most attention readers

00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,510
decide if they leave the rest of the

00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:45,180
first paragraph feels fills out the lead

00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:50,160
all five W's should be in the lead in

00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:52,560
the first sentence fact or emotion you

00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:57,300
choose both will work depending on what

00:51:52,560 --> 00:52:00,060
you want to present that also works in

00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:03,560
novels in literature here's a link like

00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:06,600
to America book review best starting

00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:08,730
sentences in of all times the best one

00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:11,880
I'm number one is from Moby Dick call me

00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:15,390
Ishmael Ismail Ishmael the first

00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,250
sentence and there's also i also have a

00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:19,350
link here for awarded lee bad once you

00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:23,520
will have a look at them it's fun to

00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:24,990
read if you want to see some IP I was

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,430
picked the Guardian because I think on

00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:29,970
this planet they are sort of like the

00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:34,170
exceptionally best news writing people

00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:37,080
and they can really help you if you know

00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:40,440
this stuff analyzed and used a right you

00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:42,000
see that they followed this so after the

00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,500
lead the first paragraph is the lead

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,150
which should catch somebody here that

00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:48,540
the second paragraph is where you give

00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:50,820
him the meat it's the so-called nut

00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,650
graph in a nutshell yeah that's the

00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,870
paragraph that has the central

00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:57,990
information in a nutshell it's after the

00:52:54,870 --> 00:53:01,050
lead and should provide facts it's the

00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:04,650
essence of your news release and it will

00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:05,730
be found just after the lead the second

00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:08,670
paragraph

00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:11,369
it's providing facts it's it's you have

00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:13,260
to still keep the language simple count

00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:17,369
the words between subject and verb eight

00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:18,720
is enough don't be long sentences check

00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:20,430
it for your language if you're not in

00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,930
English language german language you can

00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,400
have more because german language is

00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:25,260
more complicated but in english it

00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,320
should not be more than eight words

00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:30,450
between subject and verb use strong

00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,520
words appropriate images correct grammar

00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:38,970
and focus on the focus on the important

00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:42,240
part have somebody else read it and edit

00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:43,770
it towards the end you provide sentences

00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,630
like katie is a test of environment for

00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,160
linux build on QT a sentence i will put

00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:49,470
there for example it's just the basics

00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:56,940
the background did you have a question

00:53:49,470 --> 00:54:00,650
no okay oh yeah and then links to

00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:02,369
contact data press room and kids here

00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:04,050
basically the same for e-mail

00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:05,340
announcements articles blogs make it

00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,410

project description website links and

00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:17,280
links to events slow news days may give

00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:19,050
wider exposure that means are there some

00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,090
days on Monday lot of things have

00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:23,910
happened from the weekend juice events

00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:26,310
may be less happens whatever or as we

00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:28,470
did on Friday evening in Linux magazine

00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:30,420
we will put some news there that is that

00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:32,820
is colorful there's a little bit more

00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:36,090
than just Linux tech hard to text that's

00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:37,380
interesting for the weekend yeah yeah

00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:39,869
and make your team members write

00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:44,130
articles for news outlets mentor them

00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:46,200
that's cool social media I mean this is

00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:49,320
not new to you anymore social media is

00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:51,180
time thieves only amazon and Facebook

00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,500
can tell you if that's really making my

00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:54,630
if they're really making money with it

00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:57,900
because Facebook Amazon exchange data

00:54:54,630 --> 00:55:00,090
and only Facebook knows when that some

00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:03,090
advertisement from amazon on facebook

00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:05,369
has led to a to somebody buying

00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:06,840
something and only Amazon knows that

00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:10,320
that somebody who bought something came

00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:13,980
from facebook so nobody else can tell

00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,359
there's no clear roee social media you

00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,310
know that Facebook's private more

00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,440
private twitter is for media people and

00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:22,840
new spreading Google pluses take people

00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:26,770
Instagram pictures get somebody who

00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:28,510
knows what he do he does there it's so

00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:30,760
important they are scared people are

00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:34,450
skilled and you need them don't screw it

00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:36,520
up it will go viral and don't do it on

00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:40,210
your smartphone because errors happen

00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:43,330
very easily there it's nothing that you

00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:46,270
should oughta mate you can't just post

00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:48,730
your tweet on facebook and on Google+

00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:50,710
doesn't work people will see that will

00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:52,420
know that and it you get less response

00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:55,540
for that you have to have someone who

00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:57,820
does it separately and there's a lot of

00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,350
software for that around use it they cut

00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,060
right tools and don't forget to switch

00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,640
it off because lots of people get stuck

00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:05,980
in there and spend lots and lots of time

00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:12,550
last point with some funny pictures for

00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:15,340
the end good behavior how to react when

00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:20,070
press when everything is blowing up that

00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:23,770
volcanoes are a good role model if you

00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:27,610
if you always keep back then the

00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:30,790
explosion will be even bigger later so

00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:34,630
if there's problems try to solve them at

00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:38,470
once and then you have smaller chunks if

00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:42,040
you have a PR disaster it's better to do

00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:45,640
to clean up the stuff at once then to

00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:48,430
wait yeah we try to be proactive I

00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,510
picked the volcanoes because you may

00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:55,720
have heard that there's good and bad

00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:57,760
volcanoes around like the ones that go

00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,280
up regularly are considered good and

00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:04,150
beautiful like here this is Old Faithful

00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:06,010
in Yellowstone if they if you explode

00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:08,620
regularly people will get used to it if

00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:11,020
in discussions in whatever and nobody

00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:13,720
will be angry and then it's just

00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:16,090
something somewhere quite marvelous if

00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,940
you if you don't explode regularly

00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:23,080
something will build up and huge things

00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:26,350
will happen this is what happens own

00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:28,600
cordillera is a hot spot underneath the

00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:30,070
American continent that it exploded

00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:33,100
several times and the last time it

00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:35,380
exploded which is after it built up

00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,600
energy for hundreds of thousands of

00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,940
years the last time it went up it was

00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,760
640,000 years ago so it's time again and

00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:46,360
it covered half of North America with

00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:47,890
six feet of debris yeah so the longer

00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:50,170
you wait the bigger the explosion will

00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:51,910
be there may be beautiful things after

00:57:50,170 --> 00:58:01,230
this big explosions like landscapes like

00:57:51,910 --> 00:58:01,230
this or like this or like this in Europe

00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:06,100
but there's a lot of things that get

00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,990
destroyed this is months and Helen's

00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,640
again something so this is one day

00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:12,730
before you see all the forests in the

00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:16,210
ground and it's all gone yes it's no it

00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:18,130
just took hours but others that explode

00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:20,860
regularly like the stromboli this is me

00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:25,300
on the stromboli some 20 almost 30 years

00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:27,750
ago if it's exploring regularly you are

00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:31,030
sort of accountable and foreseeable and

00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:33,780
that's a much better way then even the

00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:36,100
ugly things in the background can be

00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,440
that are soaring and exploring all the

00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,340
time you can just smile them away even

00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:44,050
if you don't know what's really

00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:48,250
happening here and you don't really care

00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:56,410
about it if the whole world behind you

00:58:48,250 --> 00:59:01,410
is going up in flames so think I made it

00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:01,410
exactly in time at least it looks like

00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:08,020
excellent cool good questions from the

00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,170
audience let's hope so get some

00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:13,600
questions comments there's much more

00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:15,670
information as I said before this thing

00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:19,270
was initially a one hour one day

00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:23,020
workshop with people writing stuff about

00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:24,820
their project and it certainly made me

00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:28,270
think hey I should go through the

00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:33,130
freebsd KDE site and see what what we've

00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:37,470
got any other comments then we should

00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:37,470
