Title: Daniel VrÃ¡til - KDE PIM Status Report - QtCon Akademy 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: QtCon Akademy 2016
Description: 
	The past year was very important for the KDE PIM community. We released the first Qt5-based version, restructured our code base and set ourselves more ambitious goals. Let's look a bit deeper into some of the important changes that have happened in KDE PIM in the past year, and peak a little into the future.

thank you and thanks for coming so this

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,099
is going to be a really non-technical

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:18,119
talk I want to talk about are what we

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:22,080
broke last year and kdp and what we are

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,430
going to break next year so I just want

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,119
to basically go through things that we

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,859
did are in the past deal with other

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:35,370
developers and tell you what you can we

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:39,629
go to you you can expect from us in the

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,309
next basically four races so the biggest

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,440
thing in the past year for us will

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:48,329
switch to Katie frameworks five and cute

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,680
five or the KD applications 1508 a year

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,899
ago was our first release with key five

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,399
it already included a bunch of

00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,640
performance improvements and we worked

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,090
on the user experience as well and

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,640
overall users accepted the new version

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,409
quite well we were surprised that we

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,780
didn't run into many many pouring issues

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,670
or bugs in general are there were some

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,939
minor glitches but i think we polished

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,170
most of this by now and it works quite

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,330
well the other big thing that happened

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,540
in the past year it's actually going

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,810
it's actually in the last 16 08 release

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,810
was switched to keep App Engine so the

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,909
way we render emails and shout contacts

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,189
and even previews is that we just create

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,220
an HTML let me show it in a in a web

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,799
viewer are with the latest version of

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:45,210
cute WebKit was deprecated and since

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,880
email is one of the possible are vectors

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,710
of attack for attackers we try to get

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,140
into your computers and everything it's

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,479
it's better to have a rendering engine

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,479
which is updated and secure so we

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,070
decided to switch to keep App Engine I

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,930
know distributions headed for haters for

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,430
it now but I think in the long term it

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:08,520
will be it will turn out to be a good

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:11,190
decision as I mentioned before we will

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,620
use HTML a lot to to shower stuff

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,299
because it's the easiest thing to

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,670
how to present this kind of information

00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:20,640
like you know the even descriptions and

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,459
and details about your contact so in the

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,280
previous versions we used to have we

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,470
used to just have a C++ code that would

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,200
randomly assemble the HTML from strings

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,049
and put the proper values in the middle

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,079
it was almost impossible to maintain so

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:38,190
we slowly migrated to grant Lee

00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:41,159
currently if you don't know it is a cute

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,099
library for HTML templates so you

00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,750
basically create an HTML file where

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,790
instead where the actual values should

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,980
be just put some place holders and then

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,700
you ask Grantley to load the template

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,220
and you give it a map basically of the

00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:01,109
key place holders and what actual values

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,659
it should replace it with sorry so this

00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:05,640
allows us not to only have natural HTML

00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,530
files which are very easy to maintain

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,319
for us it also means that in the future

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,200
we can introduce something like custom

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,609
templates for provided by users so if

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,349
you don't like how your emails look

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:18,840
right now you could easily write your

00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,569
own template and use it and possibly

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:27,569
even share it with others through

00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:29,519
through the KDE store the the biggest

00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,340
thing that we've been doing in the past

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,440
year and another reason why packages

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,980
hate us was that we've been reorganizing

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,019
the git repositories a lot if you

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,599
remember Katie four times we used to

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,510
have basically four core repositories

00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:49,739
that was our kannadi k deepen lips k DP

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:54,410
and k deep in one time we decided that's

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,410
not enough so we now have this

00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:06,879
just a as a matter of fact this is

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:10,060
around 60 repositories of KD pin code

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,670
the entire KD frameworks are around 70

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:17,440
repositories so you get the idea how big

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:21,579
project actually is the reason why we

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,500
decided to split it like this is that it

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,780
basically the reason is similar like it

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,400
was with Katie Katie lips and white was

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,650
split in two frameworks we had lots of

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,690
fancy things in there but nobody could

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,990
really use it right if you wanted to use

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,419
our parser for contacts you would depend

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,500
on Kady Kady pin lips so you would your

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,599
application would also depend on the

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,889
enter our naughty thing and then able to

00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:45,130
get on the calendar parcel and all the

00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:48,310
other stuff you didn't need so we worked

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,289
on splitting these things right now we

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:55,150
have so we now have a lots of

00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:56,710
repositories the Aqua not a thing which

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,300
was basically split into the Akron the

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,909
repository and Katy Perry triple story

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,550
is not merged everything Arkady is in

00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:07,330
our code repository and we now have a

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,740
bunch of fancy libraries are that that

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,900
might be interesting for application

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,880
developers we have cake kalkor cake

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,190
contacts in came i'm which are libraries

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,780
for parsing v-cards and I calls and

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,430
email messages and you can use them

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,190
stand alone and they have very very

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,740
little dependencies so this is something

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,539
that some applications have been already

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,729
using in the KD for days but it meant

00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:33,130
like digicam was depending on Katie pin

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,320
lips for because of that or copita as

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,270
well which is silly so now they can just

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,699
pull this individual right libraries and

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,800
use it nicely k holidays is another very

00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:44,229
nice library that provides an overview

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:48,150
of national holidays and bank holidays

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:50,889
in almost all countries around the world

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,900
we also have libraries that implement

00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:55,800
various protocols so we have km up k

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:58,930
ldap which implement the individual

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,150
respective protocols there are much more

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,870
libraries in there I will not go to

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:08,409
everyone to all them so you can see that

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,740
on the first column this Katie what we

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,770
only

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,000
split it from Katie pin lips are so

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,259
Katie pin lips is no longer being

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,750
released there's nothing there in the

00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:19,150
repository anymore recently we have to

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,440
split kdp maplestory so the middle

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,449
column there's a list of applications we

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,240
have now that's not interesting what's

00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,680
interesting is the last column which we

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,060
have a bunch of libraries that were not

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,039
in katy beam lips they were sort of in k

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,740
deepen where you only buy the pimp

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,240
applications because we didn't feel like

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,009
anyone with these them but then we rise

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,440
oh there's actually some cool stuff so

00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,360
we have twenty theme library which we

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,080
create it because when we switch to

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,150
grant Lee which I talk about couple

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,190
sites ago we realized that grizzly is

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,900
missing a few things so currently theme

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,080
actually provides us with some neat

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,180
grandly KD integration so it introduces

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,060
new tags into the grant Lee seem like

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,949
you can use you can load icons through K

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,979
icon loader just by saying the name of

00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:05,530
the i use the icon tagged and the ex DG

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:07,919
name of the icon and the plugin can load

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,810
it which makes it much easier for us

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,960
there's lip gravatar which allows you to

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:17,440
easily pull a lot ours from the gravatar

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,169
and libre avatar service basically the

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,300
free the free version of Gravitar and we

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:23,740
have lip Casey which similar to k i'm up

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,490
is an implementation of the chief

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:31,389
protocol which is a filtering protocol

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,909
for 4 i'm oh so yeah we have now a lots

00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:35,590
of repositories but this is this is the

00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:38,430
fine this was the final split there will

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:42,580
be no more repositories and we hope that

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:44,110
eventually we will be able to move some

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,719
of the some of the cool stuff into katie

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,180
frameworks so for instance DK kalkor and

00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:51,250
similar repositories are would be would

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,919
be revised to have them in KD frameworks

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,349
with all the API and ABI stability

00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:03,690
promises and making that available to

00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:06,219
even wider public now to the individual

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,699
programs that we worked on so obviously

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:11,919
KML is probably the most important part

00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,659
that they're most of our focus goes on

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,620
in the terms of application development

00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,940
so we have improvements in accessibility

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,010
there was a long term complained that

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,790
the accessibility of KML wasn't very

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,310
good

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,900
now we have a text-to-speech integration

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,570
so you can actually listen to your

00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,020
emails either because you want to or

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:34,540
because you can't read them we have some

00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,000
really good performance improvements

00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:40,180
when it comes to threading so if you if

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,250
you follow some flame were heavy mailing

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:45,040
list and you give lots of very deep

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,530
threats it takes forever to open so we

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,210
now have caching for the threading so we

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,430
don't have to calculate how the emails

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:55,330
goes to the threads and we just load it

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:58,180
from a file and it's much faster some

00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,070
really tiny the useful features which

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,780
are very well hidden in the settings but

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,160
if you can find them you actually figure

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,020
out that we can do lots of clever things

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,410
now like friends if you have the problem

00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,390
like I do I have a bunch of email

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:14,590
identities right side of my work account

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:16,570
my KD account my personal email and I

00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:20,050
constantly keep sending emails to people

00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:22,690
from the wrong bit identities so in KML

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,010
now you can actually bind or choose that

00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,040
if you are sending email to a specific

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:30,070
domain that each we should use some

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,260
specific identity for that that means

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,510
for instance if you you can choose that

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,210
if you are sending an email to add KD

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,790
dot org address you always want to send

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,900
it from your @ KD Orca dress so that you

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:45,100
don't accidentally send it from your

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:47,140
work account or personal account the

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,780
nice things we saw we've seen in couple

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,880
months maybe the last two months was a

00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,370
tiny influx of new developers like

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,680
occasional contributors I think about

00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:01,840
two or three guys who send random

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:05,890
patches improving improving the search

00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,330
and and stuff like that Lorin also

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,330
spends some time on aggregator

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:12,130
aggregator is our RSS reader which has

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:16,540
been neglected for a very very very long

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:18,580
time we also switch to keep the engine

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,060
as everywhere else but that is still

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:24,550
being worked on we have a lot of lots of

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,740
bug fixes in there or let's say we

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:30,010
basically haven't fixed anything there

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,900
since the switch to cute 5 and up until

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,279
now so the last release of aggregator is

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,589
pretty good together

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,389
and yeah it was also one of the places

00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:39,779
where we saw one or two people stepping

00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:41,589
up from the community and the

00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:47,470
contributing some improvements in

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:50,529
notifications one of the things that was

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,899
most requested in plasma five since the

00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:55,600
beginnings of plasma five was the

00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,430
calendar integration so plasma five

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,930
since the beginning was all the fancy

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,480
screenshots diversion shoving the

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,889
calendar hnw but it was always empty

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,259
because there was no integration with

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:08,860
any events back end so now finally with

00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:11,680
plasma 57 I believe there is an API that

00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,569
allows our third parties to provide the

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,870
plug-in that can shout data in the

00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:19,930
plasma calendar applied and with

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,029
applications 1608 so the last release of

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,279
Katie applications the KD pimp so it

00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:27,699
also ships the plug-in that will feed

00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:35,649
your events from from key organizer into

00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:39,490
into the plasma outlet right and this is

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:42,220
a probably the biggest project that is

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,709
happening now in kdp easy gpg is

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,730
actually funded by the german government

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:51,129
to for us to work on the idea is to get

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,769
encryption and mail encryption and Mel

00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:55,420
signing to normal people normal users

00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:58,559
people who don't know what cryptography

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:01,240
is what a synchronous encryption means

00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:05,290
through a symmetric cryptography means

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,360
what keys are so the idea is to make

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,819
this easy for them basically transparent

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,610
don't but them with crypto algorithms

00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:16,290
and keys and then and then the key key

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:18,610
sizes just make it as simple as possible

00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:22,720
currently we are in phase 1 of this

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:24,579
project what we have right now is when

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,069
you create a new account using the

00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:29,259
account wizard you can also choose if

00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:31,540
you want to enable mail signing and Mail

00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:33,879
encryption by default and if you do so

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,319
in the next step we will just use the

00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,170
name and email you already provide it

00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:40,870
and we generate a new key a new key pair

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,300
we just ask for a password and then we

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:47,160
automatically publish the email to the

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:49,450
new group EG key servers

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,100
and this all happens basically without

00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:54,280
the user having to understand any of the

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,930
things behind this and we also set the

00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,480
keys to the identity which is created

00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,220
for the user and so when it when users

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,860
try to send their first email the email

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:07,750
will automatically be signed ah the Devi

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,540
also improve encryption so when you are

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,460
sending email to someone you need their

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,320
public key so you can encrypt the email

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,360
that you are sending to them this also

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,910
meant for users to actually either know

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,820
that they need a public key or they

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,010
would have to know where to go and find

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,480
the key if they didn't have it so we

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:28,450
also improved on that improved on that

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,750
now when you type in a recipient address

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:34,630
into into the composer window we simply

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,730
ask the canoe beachy key server fed to

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,320
the key if it's available and we show a

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,810
little hand saying we will send the

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,490
email encrypted to this user and the

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,630
user can just this the the center you

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,950
can just decide like I don't want to

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,740
encrypt really and you can disable it

00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,770
but by default you'll basically can send

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,220
encrypted email to everyone without

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,630
having to care about all the key stuff

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,730
the encryption for now is disabled by

00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:01,750
default you have to enable it manually

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:05,020
but once we have some more stuff in

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,910
place we will enable it by default this

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,480
is all building on the tofu concept so

00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,380
trust on first use which means that

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,300
basically you don't need to go to

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,620
signing party to get your keys verify

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,130
because on the gigs do that normal

00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:21,490
people don't so we be based on the idea

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,740
that if you receive a certain amount of

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,900
emails from the same person using the

00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,580
same key then the key can be sort of

00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,110
trust it can be trusted and the more

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,200
emails you receive the more we trust

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,500
that key and we built on we will be

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,910
built on this so basically ah now when

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,280
you now when you get an email you will

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,320
most probably get a yellow frame around

00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,420
the email saying this key is the has

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,490
unknown valid there we couldn't verify

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,650
the validity of this key what does that

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,930
even mean right so we just say this

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,820
email was signed and we believe that

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:54,790
it's the right it was sent by the right

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:58,290
person so people don't really have to be

00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,290
confused with this terminology

00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:08,700
right I put some numbers from from the

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:11,200
gate repulse the reason from bugzilla

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,050
the numbers are not precise because of

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,520
the the splitting that was happening

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,410
it's hard to track comments when they

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,990
were being moved between repositories

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,120
but it should read Leon up so in the

00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,790
past year we had 64 individual

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:30,700
contributors including including script

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:33,760
863 human contributors these 64 human

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,720
and non-human contributors made over

00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,600
8,800 comets wage sounds pretty good

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,700
right the project is healthy is being

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,170
actively developed and maintained the

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,400
community the developer base is quite

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:51,130
big yeah well there is a catch

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:53,280
seventy-two percent of these 8800 comets

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,860
we're but we're done by a single person

00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,800
that's Lauren Montel that's the only

00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,450
person who can every year beat the

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:07,300
automated scripted boat in number of

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:09,100
comments and in total ninety percent of

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,100
these comments we're done by only five

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,670
people so yeah we have lots lots of like

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:18,120
one of one on contributions but most of

00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,680
the work is done by very few people and

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,980
you saw how many repositories and code

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,920
we have so we are really struggling to

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,990
actually keep keep the quality high and

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,970
keep introducing new features and new

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,530
stuff so if you have lots of spare time

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,089
which i'm sure all if you have please

00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:40,930
help us though we managed to fix a few

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:43,150
bucks so we fixed 324 bucks at least

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:47,470
that's what back to LA claims um I think

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:53,680
it might be more but yeah so that was

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:58,030
the overview in numbers now let's look

00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:02,710
into the future we will be adding even

00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:04,870
more and even cooler crypto stuff so the

00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,819
when I was talking about the easy gpg

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:09,069
thing I mentioned it was faced one

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,400
that's obviously then also phase two

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:16,490
coming in eventually

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:19,940
hopefully in some time in 2017 we want

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:22,630
to work on actually making more or less

00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,580
secure storage for the emails locally

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,890
that means that there will be an option

00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,480
for users to choose that when an email

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,760
arrives that they want to store it

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,940
locally decrypt it so if the email comes

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,250
encrypted we can decrypt it as it

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:41,780
arrives and locally cached decrypt it

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,400
the advantage of this is that we can

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,990
index such emails when they are

00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,810
decrypted and then you can search in it

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,600
if you get lots of encrypted emails and

00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:52,280
you remember you seen something in one

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,020
of those emails you have to actually go

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,570
through the manually because we cannot

00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,730
index encrypted emails right now we

00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,990
don't see into depth so we cannot index

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,710
them so you cannot search in them easily

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:06,950
so assuming most people today use our

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,180
encrypted hard drives anyway so you

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,450
don't need another layer of encryption

00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:14,000
on top of that so we can easily just

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,940
decrypt email as it arrives and store it

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,290
locally decrypt it and index it and do

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:23,540
all other kinds of fancy stuff with that

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,850
this features should also support the

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,100
work the other way around making the

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,660
storage more secure that means every

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,310
email that would drive would be egg

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,950
cryptid with Yogi's and would be stored

00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:38,840
locally and gripped it that is probably

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:41,230
for people who are very paranoid but

00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:45,410
those are the roughly plans for the next

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:47,630
crypto work obviously we will be also

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,590
working on improving Cleopatra which is

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:54,410
the encryption key management

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:56,600
application and kdp the usability of

00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:59,240
that application is or questionable at

00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,980
best but so we want to improve it to

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,590
make again more accessible to regular

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,420
users they don't have to go in there

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,220
that's the idea of ECG BG people won't

00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,110
actually have to open Cleopatra to

00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,270
manage or work with the keys but

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:15,430
sometimes you have to and then we want

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:15,430
to make it easy for them to work with it

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,500
lauren had some plans on changes in

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,090
search um he doesn't know what exactly

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,620
he wants to do he just mentioned he

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,300
wants to do this

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,650
my plans at least were to improve the

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,380
infrastructure for searching right now

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,120
searching is rather fragile it usually

00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,590
find stuff you're we're not looking for

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,390
and doesn't find the stuff you are

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:40,890
actually looking for so we want to

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:44,220
improve it make it make it more robust

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:47,340
make it faster and we would like to

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,530
improve the DUI which i think is what

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,790
Lauren wanted to do because now there is

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,590
a search dialog which is sort of

00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,570
complicated you can build the complex

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:58,460
queries but it's all so complicated to

00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:01,260
use it so we would like to simplified it

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,260
in the past year we've been also working

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,530
on stripping down the features that we

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:10,020
have because KML has about 500 features

00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:13,080
Bruce another 300 that are in the code

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,550
but no one can find them in the UI so we

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,760
are working on actually making them

00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:20,820
optional other plugins so we have quite

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:25,040
a few things in the in katy p.m. adam's

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,040
repository which are as optional plugins

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,730
we would also do a bit of face lifting

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,590
to contact because contact looks the

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,380
same for the past i don't know how many

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,840
years it's hard to really change

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,480
anything i mean you need a list of

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,640
folders liftoff emails and the email but

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,010
we I think we can present it in a nicer

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,340
way that is more modern maybe closer to

00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,510
board the modern web interfaces do so we

00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,070
would like to look at do this as well

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,480
and we would like to streamline the

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,870
account creation and account management

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,270
right now your accounts are basically

00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,560
split into like three places and in each

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,200
place you configure something slightly

00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,810
different so I think a new account is

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,430
pain and we would like to have this in a

00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,200
single place I really like what's under

00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:11,130
bird does for instance so we might get

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,290
inspired in there and finally something

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,820
we realized the recently is that we've

00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:18,360
been working on something and we don't

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:20,820
even know what people use I mean what

00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,710
parts of contact and came out people use

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,600
how they use it how many how many

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,690
accounts they have how many emails they

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:31,110
send do they use imap do they use pop3

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,030
do they use mail there do they even use

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,010
the other applications like does anyone

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,269
even use K address book why would you

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:40,109
write so

00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:43,200
the idea is to create a survey with lots

00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:44,909
of questions and try to get it to as

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,679
many people as possible and figure out

00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:51,089
what our users actually interested in we

00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:54,389
we will be discussing this on the both

00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:55,739
on Monday and then with a bunch of the

00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:58,320
other developers the week after that and

00:21:55,739 --> 00:22:00,809
then hopefully maybe next month we will

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,119
publish it so if you see a KD p.m. user

00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:05,009
survey please help spread the word too

00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:09,149
so we can get input from as many users

00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:11,639
as possible and get some idea what we

00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:13,619
what we should focus on the most so that

00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:16,139
we can improve the KML in a way that

00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:21,739
helps our users and not just ourselves

00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:25,769
and yeah finally there will be kdp both

00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:28,049
tomorrow at 3pm in the room mar 003

00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:29,759
whatever that is but we will be there

00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:31,979
all afternoon so if you want to get a

00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,709
bit more technical about contact and KD

00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:44,940
team you can stop there and talk to us

00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:49,200
there and i believe yep that's it thank

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:52,169
you I am talking to ask are there any

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,839
plans to resurrect to support microsoft

00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:58,469
exchange no contact student a Qunari I

00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,989
mean there are few efforts few years ago

00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:02,429
I think they never got finished I think

00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:04,349
is a very big thing that still keeps

00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:05,879
many people from using it in in the

00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,019
workplace for example since why some of

00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:08,429
you have an exchange server does not

00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,440
allow i'm a poor can only do it for me

00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:15,629
it's not for contacts and for calendar

00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:19,289
data so any plans in this direction not

00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:20,789
as far as i can tell but we can put it

00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:33,479
on the never ending to do list of things

00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:35,309
to do sorry other questions yeah maybe

00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:40,669
it would be good to ask people why they

00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:43,829
do not use k mail perhaps because of say

00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:46,850
repositories because of see dependency

00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:49,790
hell or maybe because

00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:52,960
the features are missing just an idea

00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:55,520
because it cannot be there and more

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,720
think about it yep thank you I don't

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,750
think the number of repositories is

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,760
something that concerns users are most

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,200
of the repose of the distributions as

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,600
far as I know we're already doing this

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,300
split on the packaging level anyway so

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,500
now we just make it easier for the

00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,140
packages to actually packaged

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:16,010
individually it's just more packages for

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,240
the release tavares and yeah good idea

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,090
I'm still asking what they are missing

00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,430
that good thing too that but I'm sure we

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:25,610
have all the features already it does

00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:30,410
know what I managed to find a myth dan

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:32,540
I'm a packager I hate you guys but I we

00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:35,840
are done no more splitting and that

00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,400
makes me very happy thank you yeah I'm a

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:43,760
package it too so yeah I hit myself as

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:46,130
well it seems like him developers are a

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:53,660
bit of a masochist yeah any other

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:57,680
questions from the room yes so I'm one

00:24:53,660 --> 00:25:00,710
who runs k mail regularly from master

00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:04,100
including all the dependencies build and

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:06,170
I regularly have problems with the

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:10,040
regressions and the masterbuilt which is

00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:12,590
very annoying if you depend on your

00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:16,400
mails in your workflow so are there

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:18,170
plans to ensure better that the that

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,140
they are no regressions especially now

00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:23,500
that the splitting is done yeah well

00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:26,900
having the unit tests would be nice but

00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:29,840
the compilation issue is it escapes us I

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:32,300
mean there seems to be something we see

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,010
Mike we believe that it keeps looking

00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,010
for all libraries that no longer exist

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,890
even though you updated them I have the

00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,590
problem as well are not sure what the

00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,510
problem really lies um the breakage of

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:49,360
stuff yeah our unit test coverage

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:49,360
unfortunately is locket get best

00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:07,070
what was our last bottle tonight April a

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:09,320
certain almost ever quits lose it right

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:18,200
we're compiling like all right wait a

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:20,690
few days now I think we are still in the

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,760
face where we keep doing bigger changes

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,870
which tends to break while plasmids

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,380
frameworks now I'm not doing like

00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:29,020
smaller incremental changes yeah so it's

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,880
much easier for me to break things now

00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:34,280
but I can change things like really big

00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,930
changes they are still filled up in the

00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,970
inner pipe the pipeline so there will be

00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:54,650
some more instabilities in master for at

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:56,180
least in the next half year seems like

00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,970
there's plenty of discussion going on

00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,070
that yeah let's so popular it off then

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:05,500
if there are no other questions let us

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,500
