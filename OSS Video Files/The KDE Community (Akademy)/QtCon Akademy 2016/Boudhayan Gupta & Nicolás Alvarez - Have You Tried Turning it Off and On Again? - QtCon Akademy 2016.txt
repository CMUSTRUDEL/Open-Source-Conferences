Description: 
	KDE's system administrators have a to-do list that is a couple of miles long. At the same time there's a daily churn of server maintenance, ticket servicing, spam killing and a litany of other small tasks that have to be taken care of. Over the last year, however, we've managed to shorten that mile-long todo list, and we're on track to check a lot of tasks off in the next few months.
