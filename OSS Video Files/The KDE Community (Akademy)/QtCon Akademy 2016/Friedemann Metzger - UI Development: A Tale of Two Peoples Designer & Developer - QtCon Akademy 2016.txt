Title: Friedemann Metzger - UI Development: A Tale of Two Peoples Designer & Developer - QtCon Akademy 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: QtCon Akademy 2016
Description: 
	A passion to implement design specifications to each and every pixel is not common amongst developers. Precisely because classic software developers are more eager on developing complex algorithms, optimizing databases and other exiting topics. In contrast, implementing a user interface seems a trivial and boring task â€“ sometimes even demeaning! 
In most cases, the right questions at the right time decide over success or failure of a project. My session will give insights into proved and tested processes for successful UI projects. Additionally, I promote a better understanding of the need for very close collaboration between developers and designers. The goal is to encourage the developers to discuss questions with designers instead of simply implementing the next best solution.

yeah hi everybody thank you very much

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,559
for being here this is our second talk

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,080
here so I had already talked about him

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,960
Elvis practices those who have already

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,449
seen my first talk they will probably

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,100
noted that these time this time these

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,269
slides were created with help of a

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,300
designer yeah let me please introduce my

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:34,380
colleague this is Samuel naw he's user

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:51,059
experience designer presenter doesn't

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:52,379
work sorry no okay yeah there we go so

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,350
this is Samuel Cano Hugh's experience

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,899
designer my name is karima matzke I'm

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,480
software engineer and we are working at

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,640
a cuisine we are one of the leading user

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,729
experience companies here in Germany so

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:14,450
we provide user experience design and UI

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:19,350
development so on how the better is my

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:24,090
sorry guys just now that's funny okay

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,130
will do like this so we are doing user

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,619
experience design and user interface

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,000
development and we're doing that from

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,250
many fields such as consumer industry

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,720
and also medical solutions so what we

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,960
were doing the whole day is creating

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,470
user interfaces and we are doing that

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,350
with the user centered design process

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,350
and Samuel maybe you can explain that a

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,689
bit better than me yeah sure so and this

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,350
usually due process basically means from

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,689
for those of you who don't know it's

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,820
basically means that users in the center

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,100
of all design decisions and all concepts

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,939
and we really try to make sure that we

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,310
don't design for our clients or four for

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,890
the manager so we really try to focus

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,460
for the user and in the process we have

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,210
different steps and

00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:18,070
so at the beginning of each project you

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,890
actually go out to the user interview

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:23,230
them asked for what they actually need

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,770
and try to find out how they work and

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,930
then we obviously do the design and both

00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,870
conceptual design visual design and

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,330
after that we go back to user and try to

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,680
make sure that what we have done is good

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,390
for the user and we give them some

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,200
prototypes let him try out stuff and

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,590
gather some feedback and so that's

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,990
basically the part what I do and after

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,390
that after the user is happy with our

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,610
designs we hand it over to the

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:58,840
development and let's rev freedom and

00:02:51,610 --> 00:03:00,940
concentrate again okay doesn't work okay

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,980
let's give you a short introduction

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,480
about the problem so once upon a time

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,560
there was a designer who created a

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:12,100
beautiful user interface and then this

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,190
design was however dilip was however do

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,280
delivered to to the development maybe

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:21,160
with some kind of style guide or some

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,500
other design specification and yeah the

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,020
development start working and some time

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,920
later we have a final application which

00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,480
may be looked something like that well

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,760
yeah maybe in the first moment that

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,730
looks pretty good but if you compare

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,580
these both versions you will notice that

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:42,550
yeah the usual design looked very much

00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,380
better than the final result and if we

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,750
have a look in more detail so what

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,630
finally went wrong so we have the wrong

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,600
I can we have a wrong font color here

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,570
the shadows are missed and here is some

00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,730
kind of decoration missing and ya know

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,000
the discussion about who to blame for

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:04,430
that starts

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,010
maybe from a designer perspective these

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:11,030
stupid developers they always destroys

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,370
my beautiful crafted design and from our

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,740
developer perspective we say all the

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,180
lazy designers there there's always

00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,810
missing something in the design

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,880
specification and yeah then the product

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,710
manager comes into the game so at the

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,980
end there's usually also a deadline and

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,980
the product has to be shipped and

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:33,440
somehow and so at the end there's

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:38,919
probably not much not enough time left

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:44,480
to get the product right and so hey

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:46,940
early bro see ya so at the end the

00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,919
underlying reasons for what happened in

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,960
the project might be very different in

00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:54,230
there are lots of reason and the design

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,660
and the problem might be maybe I just

00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,720
didn't understand it uses goals when I

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,720
had the analysis phase maybe the Dutch

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,830
word was very tired maybe my

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,740
specifications were not really complete

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,490
and there are tons of reasons what might

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,570
share my concepts are not good enough or

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,280
maybe I just don't have enough

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:18,290
experience and knowledge about the

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,870
technology for the development yeah from

00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,850
the developers perspective maybe they

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,650
don't have any experience with UI

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,890
development because user interface

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,870
development so software developer isn't

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,550
necessarily the same as a user interface

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,900
developer there are a lot of additional

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,550
skills needed there the development can

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,220
misunderstand the requirements for

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,720
example imagine in HMI context where we

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,540
have buttons which have to represent

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,650
every time the state of the machine

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:52,130
instead of representing instead of

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:54,110
displaying just its own state or they

00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,090
maybe have no knowledge about design

00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:00,290
principle for example if we deliver some

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:03,140
kind of just controls and the customer

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,940
is responsible to build their own views

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,740
with the controls they need to know how

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,740
to do that correctly that it behaves

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,350
good and that it looks well and finally

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,630
the most important thing

00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,400
if the development has no idea about the

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:21,050
intention behind a design then it's very

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:24,940
very complicated to to to to to develop

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,940
the controls like they should behave

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:31,850
well we have seen we have seen that

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,280
there as a yeah there the way from the

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,070
ID to the final product is very hot and

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,770
sometimes sometimes also dangerous the

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,460
ID through design lent to develop

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,690
country and then finally to the to the

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,020
application and in the next hour we want

00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:51,170
to talk about options how to improve

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:57,260
this journey and what we can do to make

00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:59,060
this way a bit easier so there are a

00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,960
couple of things we might have to

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,570
consider and when we are going now in

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,420
the next half an hour from design lento

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:11,980
developed country and the first step at

00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:14,000
the beginning is so it some how

00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,250
different other people that are involved

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,130
and it's really important you probably

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,120
know that designers and developers can

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,740
be slightly different sometimes and I

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,010
really like that slide film and found in

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,500
a couple of days ago and it shows it

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,630
really nicely because in the first

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,550
moment developers and designers look

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,860
quite similar and they are taking some

00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,930
stuff into their laptops but if you look

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,620
closely the way they think and the way

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,840
they work is very different and so if

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,870
designers and developers look at the

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,750
same thing they might have different

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,280
perceptions of what they see and it's

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,220
not about right or wrong it's just

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,920
different perspectives they have so we

00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,400
have a little example that shows exactly

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,830
that and and that's actually something

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,160
that happens in a lot of cases and in a

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,500
lot of projects so and one of our

00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:13,130
designers created a little fly out menu

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,140
and specified it and gave it to the

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,210
development and it looked quite similar

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,160
to that one so there was a button and

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,050
the flyout menu and some menu items in

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,720
there and the designer added some

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,430
examples about how many edge how many

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,060
items can be in there

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,130
how they look and so the developer also

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,460
thought hey that's clear I'm going to do

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,860
it but then you finally came to a

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,710
question what to do when there are three

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,910
menu items and there are basically two

00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:46,160
possibilities and and at the end the

00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:48,290
designer had a different idea than the

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,240
developer yam from a development

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,850
perspective is what it was pretty clear

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,490
because there was no specification for

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:58,370
this cell here so the developer didn't

00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,010
know how to style and how this this yeah

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:04,580
this way to display should it should

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,980
should be implemented so again that's

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,830
nothing about who to blame or whose

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,980
fault it is it's just misunderstandings

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:16,850
that happen a lot when designers and

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,410
developers work together so it's not

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,990
only about different perspective it's

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,790
all also about different knowledge

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,830
designers and developers are different

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,670
people they have different jobs to do

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:33,770
and that's also the reason because they

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:35,840
are a designer or a developer and so we

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,600
have to find a way to get the knowledge

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,390
somehow together and form one Union

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,430
without knowledge and it's also very

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,920
important that both need to love what

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,740
they do so what I mean with that is we

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,980
need to have an intrinsic motivation to

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,570
to develop a good product this is very

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,370
important that it doesn't make sense of

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,720
the developer doesn't care about any

00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:02,110
design decisions so we need to have fun

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:07,520
while implementing some controls or yeah

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:10,280
work around those pixels stuff yeah so

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,230
at the end we can maybe learn that

00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,730
designers and developers are very

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,490
differently and they work very

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,740
differently differently but at the end

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,010
both of them are equally important in

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,480
the project and no one neither the

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,280
developer or the designers more

00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,770
important they are both next necessary

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,600
to get a good result so we have to

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,620
appreciate our different knowledge and

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,620
our different perspectives

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,960
the next step is to get somehow an

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,670
understanding that we have these

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,770
different knowledge and these different

00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,649
perspectives and these misunderstandings

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,540
up here so we have to find out how we

00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:50,330
can reduce these misunderstandings and

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,180
that's basically by understanding each

00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,770
other in a better way if from a

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,010
developer's perspective it's good when

00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:00,560
we tell our designer how we work so they

00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,450
can take care of it so we need also to

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,640
tell them about the framework

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,800
characteristics we use for example if

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,330
we're doing a qml project it's very

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,459
important that they know that it's very

00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:13,130
easy to work with animations for example

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:15,320
that it's very easy to add some kind of

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,240
effects or transitions and all these

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,260
things and if they know that they can

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,339
respect that later in the design and

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,450
from the other side is also very

00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:26,930
important to tell them about

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,790
restrictions for example yeah in qwidget

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,790
it was pretty difficult to work with

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:34,820
shadows on the things and if they know

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,500
that they can take care of it so

00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,200
basically at the end it comes down to

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,959
share your knowledge and if freedom and

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,870
tells me about the stuff he does and I

00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,430
can develop some interest in it and then

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,950
I can respect that in my design

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,320
decisions and also make sure that what

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,670
I'm doing is what you need and on the

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,709
other hand it's also good if the

00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,900
developer knows something about my stuff

00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:58,610
about the design process about the user

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,190
girls and about all these design

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:05,810
decisions I made in the beginning of the

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:07,970
project yeah and it's it's very

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,880
important to know in the boundaries for

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,430
example if if the design the designer or

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,410
Samuel insists and something then I need

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,839
to trust him it has a reason why there

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,730
should be implemented like this and I

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,820
need to trust that it will be important

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:26,209
for the user experience and in that case

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:29,959
we need to do or our best to to yeah to

00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:31,630
make the visions real finally and also

00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,839
if something is too time-consuming

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:38,899
because well maybe the deadline isn't

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,610
far away or the budget is low then we

00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:43,370
need to explain it then we need to

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,130
discuss maybe some alternative solution

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,990
and

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:51,770
in the best case we will find a

00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:53,820
compromise yeah that means also that

00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,800
it's very important to have a good

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,630
relationship between designers and

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,510
developers so sometimes it's very

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:03,300
important to talk about problems to toe

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:06,300
and to be honest and for that it's a

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,580
good idea to wave especially in long

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,120
approach x2 sometimes go out and drink a

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:15,630
beer together just do it too to have a

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,000
better relationship in this case yeah so

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,760
make sure that you really share your

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,640
knowledge and I know as a designer that

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,400
you know a whole lot of cool stuff in

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,110
the development and I also know

00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,690
something a little bit cruel about the

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,550
design so it's really good if you can

00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:41,130
share these no let's no let's with each

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:44,400
other now we've crossed these little

00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,960
stones but the next step is a very

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,320
important run and that's the handover

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,200
and so in our projects as I said before

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,030
we first left the design then we hand it

00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,000
over to the development and then it's

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,950
actually implemented and and so for the

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,100
hand over it's really important that

00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:05,190
this happens all right if the handover

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,290
is bad and project result will probably

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,350
also be bad but if the handover is good

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,900
you can at the end save a lot of time

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:15,540
yeah so they're different kind of

00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:18,270
specification documents the designer can

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,230
provide us for example the control

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:24,900
specification itself they can prepare

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,820
animations there can prepare yeah break

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,860
point scaling we have behavior of the

00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,900
things can be documented but the most

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,690
important thing is to understand the

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:37,140
overall vision of the designer so we

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:39,030
need to take care how we get these this

00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,120
information and the best way is to do

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:45,270
this kind of hand over face to face so

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,370
if if we if he gives me a design

00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,900
specification for example we usually sit

00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,150
together in a meeting room and he

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,780
explains me step by step what to do and

00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:57,390
this is very important and at this

00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,910
moment I can tell him what I need to

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,590
and the design specification for example

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,680
if I need additional informations like

00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:06,840
yeah maybe an interactive prototype or

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,730
something which would help me to

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,340
understand better what what the

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:15,170
intention was then i can ask him to do

00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:18,690
this for me so it's very important to

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:21,950
understand the behavior instead of yeah

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:26,010
just starting the controls anywhere

00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:28,530
though this is a kind of interactive

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:31,020
prototype prototype which Samuel

00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:33,300
prepared for me and if you have as a

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,180
developer something like this it's much

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,210
more easier to understand how all these

00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,620
things should work together and we have

00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,830
you have something like this then you

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,650
don't need to read hundreds of pages of

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:49,080
documentation for example because it's I

00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,660
can directly see how how this how it

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,030
should behave and I don't don't have to

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,640
write specification much from our

00:15:54,030 --> 00:16:03,450
fantage er to a prototype then writing

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:05,850
PDFs okay um well I already explained

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:10,160
most of the things here on the slide so

00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:13,230
but it's not bad to repeat it again so

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,870
sometimes and some projects we

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,860
developers or the first non designer who

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:22,710
had to really think in two to think very

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,560
deep into the into the design and into

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,650
the user interface and at this point we

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,450
will notice maybe some problems with

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:33,180
first time use or especially edge cases

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,000
or in between cases or we will notice

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,090
that that something is missing with a

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,550
scaling behavior or yeah we have the

00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,950
questions okay and what happens that the

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,170
user clicks here and all these things we

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:50,400
can directly or we shoot directly to

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:52,620
discuss with with a designer yeah all

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,050
these things with first time use and

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,530
edge cases is something we had the

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:00,600
design actually don't think about too

00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:03,990
much so in the design we think about

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,300
what happens if the user needs this or

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,459
needs that and we think about the eighty

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,290
percent solution for the user to make

00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,360
sure we

00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:14,510
and we have all concepts and all

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,610
scenarios implemented and we have the

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,440
functionality that user needs but

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:21,920
something like you see on the image it's

00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,980
basically a message box which shows

00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,170
warnings and errors and of course we

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,790
care in the design about what happens if

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,620
the list is too long and what happens if

00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,410
they click user clicks on it but

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:36,080
actually the first time you state or

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,000
like the state when it's empty we don't

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,580
focus too much in the design and that's

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,710
a reason why me we might forget

00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,890
something and so be patient with us and

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:49,100
just ask us and we will not be angry if

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,780
you ask us at the other end if you ask

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,080
us it shows me that you are really

00:17:50,780 --> 00:18:01,490
interested in and trying to get the

00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:04,430
knowledge so Chism up the third chapter

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,290
get the design inspiration and hand over

00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:13,160
face to face and ask everything

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:16,790
everything you need so the fourth step

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,820
is about collaboration also after they

00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:23,180
hand over you have to communicate a lot

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:29,000
and collaborate a lot and we also have

00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:32,570
some tips for that because otherwise it

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,060
ends like this and that actually happens

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,070
a lot of time the designer might be

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,680
slightly annoyed when you ask so many

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,630
questions and give some answers that

00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,880
don't help you like just implement the

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,160
center behavior which of course is hard

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,980
for you because they're usually is no

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,440
span of behavior or I just say there's

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,020
obvious and it might be obvious in my

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,300
mind but not in yours and on the other

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,510
hand the developer feels that the

00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,490
designers is not trying very hard and so

00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,950
he's also not trying a heart very hard

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,740
and maybe just doesn't ask and just does

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,960
it like he wants to be your he pretends

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:12,620
it nothing it's not possible but it

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,850
actually at the end would be possible so

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,200
what can you do to prevent that first

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,450
it's very important that you communicate

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,500
early in the project not just at the

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,020
handover and maybe a little bit after

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:29,280
try to be involved in a project already

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:33,030
when i'm doing the designs it's not

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,460
something that I feel bad about if the

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,740
developers it's in the meeting and tries

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:41,400
to tell me what I have to do now it's

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:43,500
really helps so I really appreciate it

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,450
when when in a project and where we are

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,780
making design decisions there's also a

00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,790
developer at the table and lady tells me

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,640
something about the technology or the

00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:56,250
framework or what's what's possible to

00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,290
do and what's hard to do and on the

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,960
other hand you will get the right image

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,180
and you will get the reason and you will

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,700
understand why I make certain design

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:11,190
decisions you also have to communicate

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:14,670
longer in the project not just the end

00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:18,210
over and then it's done try Jeff the

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:22,380
designer working with you through all

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:25,080
the development project so when we are

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,060
having projects and we have a good

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,060
situation that it's actually part of our

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,340
process and so I have about ten percent

00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,220
of the whole development time allocated

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,110
for me as a designer and that's actually

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,870
really good and we usually need that

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,640
time because there will be questions and

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,490
there will be missing spades or missing

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,860
controls or our customer might just have

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:50,160
new requirements and I have to to design

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,380
something else and if you don't have

00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,260
that time you will probably as a

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,090
developer end up alone and just have to

00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,150
think about all that stuff you're itself

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:07,470
that is actually i'm part of the

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:10,980
designers job communicate very

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:14,310
frequently we have some little chat

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:17,330
bubbles here and we try to communicate

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:20,250
every day in the project and it usually

00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,740
starts like freedom and has a question

00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,630
about the control or I forgot estate and

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,060
so freedom and asked me hey what does

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:29,160
the press they'd look like and usually

00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,350
these things are sorted out within two

00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,290
or three minutes so it's not a lot of

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,270
time and if

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,040
gets more complicated we switch to the

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,270
phone or Omega screen sharing but it's

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,040
really important that you keep in

00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:44,720
contact during the development yeah this

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,130
is an example we just had a few weeks

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,370
ago Samuel wanted no I needed to style a

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:56,540
cute review with qsl style sheets and he

00:21:52,370 --> 00:22:00,230
wanted to have the space for this small

00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:03,350
triangle with width of 60 pixels but he

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:06,980
also want the that the offset for the

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:09,560
hierarchy levels where 40 pixel but this

00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,330
isn't actually really possible to do

00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,910
this with kids or style sheets because

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,640
you can only set one indent and this

00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:19,400
indent is also used for this triangle

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,790
into the space so what I finally did is

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,830
I ask Samuel I talk to him why a phone

00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:28,280
and I explained him okay so there are

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:32,810
few possibilities the the easiest one

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:36,440
would be too well just adjust the indent

00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:39,290
a bit or yeah I I had to touch some C++

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,210
code to to make this possible and yeah

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,730
we found an easy solution we just took

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,820
with just that ok let's take 50 pixels

00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,320
the difference is negligible and yeah it

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:55,280
will save a lot of time in the

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:56,840
development later yeah and the this is

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,670
also something very important that is

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,840
definitely definitely not a best-case

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:04,580
scenario but in some projects there will

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,230
be something changed on the design where

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,750
we have already started implementing the

00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:11,210
controller and especially in this case

00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:14,390
it's very important to communicate a lot

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,430
and every time I start I would like to

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,740
start with the with a development of a

00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:21,380
new control i will directly ask him hey

00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,720
Samuel do you think that some something

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,430
will change or his control already

00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,260
finished for one hundred percent and

00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:34,520
then he can give me the green light and

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:35,220
I will start to develop the control so

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,669
to make sure

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:43,770
that the quality of your work in the

00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:47,640
design way is what I have what I wanted

00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:51,270
to have a similar it's good to have make

00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,039
design reviews and really often it's

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,080
like this you have a design and then you

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,539
have a deal of development and like one

00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,620
day before shipping the designer looks

00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:02,909
at it again and there might be some some

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:08,580
differences and then there's not enough

00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:12,150
time to correct it and so try to make

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,400
design reviews frequently and from years

00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,559
of design and design reviews are always

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,100
a little bit hard because I have to

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,919
criticize you guys you guys and for what

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,480
you are doing and I have to say hey

00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,980
that's wrong and that's wrong and this

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,200
doesn't look right and I don't really

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,970
feel good when when I have to do that

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,840
with your work because I know that

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:36,690
you're tried really hard and so just

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,059
keep in mind it's part of my job to make

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,220
design reviews and it's part of part of

00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:49,940
my job to focus on all these little

00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:53,700
details another method you can use as

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:57,289
retrospectives after the project and so

00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:01,860
there are a million different different

00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:04,860
ways to do retrospectives the key of a

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:08,850
risk perspective is to get feedback of

00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:12,030
your your teammates and to get honest

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:15,150
feedback not just will maybe a male just

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:18,270
talk to talk about the project face to

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:21,240
face and the way we usually do it is

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:24,390
like this we literally have these blocks

00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,640
on a whiteboard or a flip chart and then

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,230
everyone collects some post-its and

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,570
writes down which is what you guys

00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,980
thought about the project and so there

00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,900
might be negative points there might be

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,360
questions it might be points to discuss

00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,360
and also you shouldn't forget the

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,390
positive stuff but the key of all of

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,750
this is to get feedback and to make sure

00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:49,159
if there were problems you can do it

00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,159
better in the next project

00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:56,489
so at the end both of you are in one

00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:59,249
team and both of you want to create a

00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:01,829
good product and you have the same goals

00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:10,889
and so you also should collaborate and

00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:13,679
communicate as a team so we are finally

00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:21,599
in developed country and the last

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:26,279
chapter is about cute so um this little

00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:28,619
prototype and it shows you have seen it

00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:32,699
already I know but it shows like a lock

00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:34,679
screen for an industrial machine it's a

00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:37,109
very large food processing machine and

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,819
basically you would slide up the lock

00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:42,239
screen if you want to see the interface

00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:44,249
and then you can log in and after they

00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:46,769
look in you see the actual interface and

00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:51,059
on the other hand you over of course can

00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:54,119
slide down again and and that's the

00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:57,839
thing which I was really surprised it

00:26:54,119 --> 00:27:02,009
was great fun to design and such a thing

00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:04,499
but if it were made in other

00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:08,399
technologies it would probably have been

00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:11,519
not possible in that way so I'm not a

00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:13,919
I'm not a developer I don't know exactly

00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:17,159
but usually when I'm do when I'm making

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,869
broad projects that are not in huge that

00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,409
developer would say oh that's really

00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:23,729
complicated or scaling behavior

00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:27,029
responsive is not possible and

00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:30,229
animations are very very hard with the

00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:33,959
performance and that's actually cute

00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:35,909
cute thing about cute so funny man

00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:37,169
actually encouraged me to add some

00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:41,069
animations and to think about

00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:44,849
transitions and all that stuff and in

00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:48,539
this case we actually ended up doing all

00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:51,719
that stuff together so i made a design

00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:54,829
draft and i made this this prototype and

00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:57,809
and handed it over to freedom on and

00:27:54,829 --> 00:28:00,220
then obviously he wrote the code because

00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:03,309
i know nothing about development

00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,900
but we did all the transition

00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:07,480
fine-tuning and the animation

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:11,020
fine-tuning together and we really set

00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,570
side by side and and thought about

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:16,960
easing types and animation duration and

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:20,559
tried to to get out the last few percent

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,539
out of the product yes yeah it was one

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,190
time it was pretty funny because when we

00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:26,740
had together look in the code and he

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,679
just said out can we make this a bit

00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,030
slower maybe i was looking to my coat

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,450
and the air i think it should be

00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:38,350
adjusted here ah oh cool yeah so i'm not

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:40,630
used to see that designers understand

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,340
something in my coat and yeah qml is

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,309
very lightweight it's very easy to

00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,289
understand its declarative man yeah so

00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:49,630
also designers can understand something

00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:51,309
it's necessary actually if you know a

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:53,710
bit of CSS it's not too hard to

00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:56,440
understand the key ml code I could not

00:28:53,710 --> 00:29:02,020
write it but if I look at it I have an

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:03,610
idea what will happen so of course we

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,980
have our tools and I start with

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,809
scribbling and then I'm doing the

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,510
designs and I like doing these

00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:12,909
prototypes and anto type or other

00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,650
persons might use sketch or illustrator

00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:18,490
and of course the developer has

00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:20,799
different tools but at the end our work

00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,900
can be little be a little bit closer

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,470
together so we can close the gap between

00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:29,289
design development a little bit yes so

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:32,440
we already started to use qml and cute

00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:34,150
is already in the design and already in

00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,900
the prototype so especially in the

00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:40,059
prototyping phase of such a project then

00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,039
it's pretty cool because you can very

00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:44,860
quickly try out animations and all these

00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,419
things then finally we're able to reuse

00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:49,480
some code snippets in the later

00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:51,490
development project and this is why yeah

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,320
why it's very good thing to do

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,730
development so user interface

00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,730
development projects with cute

00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:05,990
so at the end you can really save time

00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,990
with its cute and by doing it together

00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:15,780
now we have finally arrived at developed

00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:19,409
country and if you happen to work

00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,690
together with designers maybe just try

00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:24,299
this a little bit and try to appreciate

00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,940
that you're different and share your

00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:28,740
knowledge and try to do a really good

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,490
face-to-face and over and really

00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:34,620
communicate together as a team and

00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:37,650
because designers and developers might

00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,480
look different a little bit and behave

00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,390
different and have a different way to

00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,360
think but both of them are really cool

00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:50,360
people and we are having a lot of fun in

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,360
our projects thank you

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:10,370
yes so we have few minutes left are

00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:13,940
there any questions here yeah you use

00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:18,020
Adobe Illustrator during this design

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:20,810
process what is your usual step from

00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,560
coming from illustrator or PDF or

00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:27,740
whatever the output is of illustrator to

00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:31,310
accumulate a sign basically usually we

00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:33,650
don't use illustrator so it's one tool

00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:35,840
we use depending on what the project is

00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:39,170
like but usually we use a tool called

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,630
anta type I don't know if you have heard

00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:47,750
about it it's actually developed by our

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:49,730
company and in antitype we can do the

00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,860
conceptual design with wireframes and

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,670
also the visual design and there we also

00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:57,560
can can do these dynamic prototypes and

00:31:54,670 --> 00:32:00,650
so at the end that's the base for our

00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,990
specifications and we also give this

00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:05,840
anta type file to our developers so they

00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:08,060
can have a look at it and they click on

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,680
an element and directly see the size and

00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:13,880
the color and under dimensions and so

00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,650
actually we don't use illustrate it too

00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,800
much if it's possible to work with enter

00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,800
type

00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:40,930
so I'm a little bit curious about the

00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:43,270
topic testing because the design concept

00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:46,180
has to be tested somehow and how can you

00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:53,110
integrate the testing people into that

00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:56,620
process what's the idea of that we

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:59,860
usually try to do the testing at an

00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:03,100
early stage in the project so if it's

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:06,400
possible we do the validation even

00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:08,920
before the visual designs that we make

00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,530
some wire frame frames and we make sure

00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:14,620
we don't spend too much time in refining

00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:22,120
all the details and already then we go

00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:24,430
out to the end users and test it so so

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,770
we try to do the validation very early

00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:28,990
and just after the concepts are finished

00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:41,080
we handed over to the development what's

00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:52,630
that your question I the testing under

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:55,320
development yeah I your talk yes

00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:58,030
sometimes it depends on the customer so

00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:01,480
often the customers and they have its

00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:03,430
own tools which they want to use yeah it

00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:06,940
depends there are different tools on the

00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:09,870
market which are doing air for automated

00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,870
you your eye testing

00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:25,080
I have two questions one is how can we

00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:28,290
get we like these graphical thinking

00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,510
design people into thinking about things

00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:33,030
like accessibility and more like

00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:35,880
information flow which is like how we

00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:37,830
think and we kind of sometimes complain

00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,660
that the designers day so graphical and

00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,490
how do we get them there that's one

00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:44,190
question the other question is that the

00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:46,830
tool you mentioned is developed in your

00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:48,929
country a company any chance to have it

00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,330
as free software this would if this is

00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:57,630
just missing so much so you would be

00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:59,550
this standard if it's good yeah well I

00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:04,890
think the first question was for you

00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:07,380
maybe yeah the question was how can we

00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:10,910
get the design thinking into the

00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,910
development kind of thinking

00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:23,250
accessibility for example okay yeah yeah

00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:28,500
yeah yeah it's absolutely absolutely

00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:31,050
true and and the design we sometimes

00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,630
wish maybe we should think about it but

00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:38,760
usually we don't think too much about it

00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:40,950
and I think it's at that point it's

00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,490
really important to be together very

00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:46,100
early and so if you if you are actually

00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:49,920
in the meeting when we are doing the

00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:54,720
main layouts and the basic the basic

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:58,470
design decisions maybe if you trigger us

00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:02,400
and ask about that even then the early

00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:06,210
stage maybe we can do it so that would

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,010
be my motive and I don't really know

00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:11,310
what to answer to a second question but

00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:14,880
i think the software will will not be

00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:17,190
open because it's it's also written it's

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,800
also it's only available for mac so

00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,800
let's make only two and

00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:40,369
that's a free trial though ok any other

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:40,369
