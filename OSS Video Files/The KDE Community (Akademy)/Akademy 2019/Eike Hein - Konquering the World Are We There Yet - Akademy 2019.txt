all right um thank you so much for

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,720
coming

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,800
um this talk was originally supposed to

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,040
be held by nate graham

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,799
who closed last year's academy to a

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,639
standing ovation so that will be a tough

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,400
act to follow

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,560
and unfortunately he couldn't make it to

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,439
academy this year so a few days ago he

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,920
reached out to me

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,800
and asked me to substitute for him and

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,279
the material

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,720
i'm about to put up um is based on an

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,119
exchange i had with him

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,240
so i'll try to be a faithful conduit to

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,920
what he had in mind

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,120
and what the team that had been working

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,239
with him has been up to so far

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,079
so um just like with ivan's talk this

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,879
talk is supposed to give an update on

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,640
another one of our three community goals

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,160
in 2017 at an academy we came up with

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,280
this idea of electing

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,719
community-wide goals that would

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,640
allow us to tackle issues that span more

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,920
than one project team

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,320
and and get things done as a community

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
again

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,320
because at that time we felt we had

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,560
fragmented a bit into into sort of

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,439
teams that didn't work as closely with

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,080
each other as they maybe had in the past

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,479
privacy was one of the goals onboarding

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,520
was the second goal and the third goal

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,520
is usability and productivity that was

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,880
chosen in november 2017

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,479
in the first gold selection and it was

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,040
submitted by nate

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,759
and people from the kde visual design

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
group which

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
is itself already a community spanning

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,799
team

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,240
that tries to tackle design issues and

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,799
and

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,960
visual issues in our ui and maintains

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,159
our theming and that kind of thing

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,680
the visual design group itself um sort

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,200
of is the successor to

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,720
some previous initiatives we had in the

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,840
community like the hci

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,240
initiative and the kde usability slash

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,520
open usability group

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,640
i myself my name is ike i work

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,479
on plasma and on kde apps so at various

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
times i've been a participant in this

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,719
goal

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,319
at other times i've been a benefactor

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,119
from the things that all the amazing

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,599
people

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,840
who grouped around it have been doing

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,720
and in the past i was also part of the

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,879
hci initiative

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,800
the goal like all the other goals held a

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,400
sprint that happened this year and was

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,640
co-located with the plasma sprint in

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,959
valencia spain

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,560
on that note thank you so much for our

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,200
sponsor slim book for hosting us in

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,200
their offices

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,920
and let's take a look at the goal

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,319
in detail so the goal set out to improve

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,840
the usability and productivity of all

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,640
kde software

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,440
those are complementary they are not

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,519
supposed to compromise each other

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,040
there was a strong belief that those can

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,800
be tackled in tandem

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,920
and can inform each other on the

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,640
usability side we wanted to have better

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,319
defaults across all kde software

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,239
we wanted to improve the consistency of

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,959
kde software in terms of how it handles

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,080
how it looks

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,519
how things are done and the

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,040
discoverability of all its functionality

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,959
because most kd software is very

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,280
powerful but sometimes

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,599
that power is quite buried in there and

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,080
we wanted to surface it better

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,680
one of the ways to do that is to try to

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,640
make things easy to understand with

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
natural language

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,280
instead of employing technical jargon

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,280
this is also an idea that spring force

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959
in parallel in the kd promo group that

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,920
was doing great work on

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,799
sort of cleaning up our websites and and

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,120
framing

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,480
and presenting our software in more

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,040
natural ways that

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,280
allow people to understand what our

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,920
software actually does at times

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,239
and we wanted to improve the ease of

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,440
finding kde software of installing it

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,480
and of managing it on your system

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,239
and allowing the user to do that with

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,879
greater use than before

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,400
on the productivity side we wanted to

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,400
retain all of the power

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,599
full functionality that kde software has

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,519
we didn't want to

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,959
remove any of the features to make

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,439
things simpler easier

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,200
whether the idea was that we want to

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,959
surface that functionality and make it

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,079
easier to use

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,239
one of those um ways was to

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
maintain and improve our keyboard

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,240
shortcuts which

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,000
is something that power users use to

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,680
accomplish tasks faster

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,800
and that's a sort of metaphor

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,440
for how we approach that in general keep

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,840
features that allow power users who get

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,080
very intimate and familiar with software

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,080
to

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,440
be able to accomplish their tasks with

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,759
the same speed they're used to or faster

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,680
a while ago the plasma team specifically

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,520
adopted a motto for plasma

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,680
called simple by default powerful when

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,759
needed

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,360
these two halves of this goal were

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,880
chosen

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
to sort of complement that and to be

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,960
inspired by that motto where

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,520
usability to us means we want it to be

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,080
simple by default it shouldn't be harder

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
than it needs to be but at the same time

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,600
it should

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
retain its power and be powerful when

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
needed

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,479
so that the user can start using kde

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,600
software and find it very easy to engage

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,320
with at the start

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,280
but also as they get familiar with the

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,280
software

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,639
they should be able to become

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,400
progressively more powerful

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,840
using the software and have an easy time

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,840
discovering the functionality

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,120
and use it now

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,160
so the approach that the team took to

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,440
to accomplish these goals was a very

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
interactive one

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,840
in terms of interacting with the

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,560
audience around kde software

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,960
a very conscious emphasis was placed on

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,080
fixing long-standing issues first

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,800
there was a perception in kd's user

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,639
community

00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,319
that sometimes reporting bugs

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,400
was sort of pointless almost where

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,520
things would be repeated by large groups

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,120
of people but

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,759
not tackled in that sort of order

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,560
where users were screaming they had this

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,319
kind of issue

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,759
and that kind of issue that would fall

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,960
into certain patterns

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,600
but they wouldn't get addressed timely

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,880
based on the popularity of those issues

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,479
so

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,400
the first step was to index all the

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,759
issues we have and sort of try edge them

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,520
by how long they had been around and

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,479
how many users had been clamoring for

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,880
sort of relief of those pain points

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,520
on the matter sort of level we wanted to

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
get it

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,520
make it very easy to get involved with

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,039
this initiative

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,360
one of the other goals was onboarding

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,520
this goal is very complementary

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,520
in the sense that to get this work done

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,240
we needed new contributors and a lot of

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,759
them

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,000
so we worked very closely with the

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,840
onboarding team and

00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,720
to get new developers into kde

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,280
and get them to help us out we did that

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,880
by

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,880
trying to standardize the build tools

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,400
and the documentation on

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,720
how you can build plasma or build kde

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,039
software locally on your system

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,240
we improved a lot of the wiki pages to

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,240
make it easier

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,440
and made some hard decisions on what was

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,680
our preferred way

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,840
of installing a development session and

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,160
and helping out

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,280
and then we wanted to communicate our

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,280
progress

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,039
so people could keep track of what we're

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,639
doing and feel good about it

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,199
and make sure that the world knows that

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,039
this is happening and that we take

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,240
the concerns that the user audience had

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,360
seriously

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,800
and so we started a weekly blog series

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,080
helmed by nate who collated all the work

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
being done by the initiative

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,400
and would write a weekly blog post

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,080
listing all the things

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
showing screenshots of the things that

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,840
had been improved often contributed by

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,879
the people who had

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,879
made the fixes themselves and it became

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,800
very rewarding i think for the team to

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,000
sort of document their progress

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,840
and that certainly helped with

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,840
motivation and keeping the momentum up

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,560
now let's talk about the results we've

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,199
been doing this for slightly over a year

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,720
or almost

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,759
sort of 18 months in that time

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,440
we have released many major pain points

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,000
that had been long standing that people

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,599
had been complaining about

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,360
a lot of effort was placed into

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,080
improving plasma discover

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,319
plasma discover is the software center

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,599
that is part of a kd system this harkens

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,599
back to the earlier point

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,919
about making it easy to find and manage

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,640
kde software on your system

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,240
this covers the way to do that and we

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
put a lot of effort into

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,240
improving its user interface also

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,000
improving its reliability

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
making sure it never crashes or

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,880
hopefully as

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,880
little as possible and making it faster

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,000
improving the way it presents software

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,040
search results

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,880
improving the way it presents search

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,240
results and

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
updates that are available

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,440
and a lot of that work on discover

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,720
actually ended up affecting other

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,640
applications

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,399
discover uses one of kd's newer

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,640
technologies which is the kirigami

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,720
user interface toolkit which is based on

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,839
qt quick and qml which lars talked about

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,720
earlier

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,880
and fixing discover meant going lower in

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,640
the stack and improving that library

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,640
a lot which in turn helped other

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
applications also built on the same

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,399
stack

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,920
another part of a kde system is the belu

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,880
file indexing service which

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,560
is powering our search and certain

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,920
advanced features like tagging

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,800
and then saved searches all across kd's

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,920
file manager

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,000
and file dialogs baloo also had

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,440
some long-standing reliability issues

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
that was another

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,839
area of strong focus to finally get rid

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
of those and good progress was made

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,000
there

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,240
another problem that lots of users

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,040
encountered

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,320
was inconsistent behavior with their

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,120
input devices

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,240
where certain mice wouldn't or trackpads

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,959
wouldn't

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,959
operate as expected one of the reasons

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,240
for that is that on the linux desktop

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,839
until recently

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,760
we had two sort of separate input stacks

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,399
and depending on which device you used

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,680
different

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,240
stacks would be in use and

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,839
we made the decision to default to the

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
lib input stack which is the new of the

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,880
two and

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,959
by upstream intended to be the

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,360
replacement for the old stuff

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,760
we wanted to get on board with that and

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,160
we wanted to switch to the input as well

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,519
consistently which meant a lot of work

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,160
on our settings ui

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,040
and and stuff related to input devices

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,360
to make

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
the newer generation of input stack just

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,560
as complete as the old one was so that

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,560
we could then retire the old one

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,360
that was driven to completion

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,920
essentially currently we have

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,200
full lip input support and exposed

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,720
essentially all of the settings it

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,959
offers

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,440
and still in progress are

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,880
improved ui and workflows around samba

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,680
file sharing which is

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,000
how linux systems access sort of windows

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,560
based

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,920
servers and also linux based file

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,000
sharing servers a lot of the time

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,200
users had performance problems ease of

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,360
use problems with

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,160
file shares we've worked on that and

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,480
also multi-screen multi-screen

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,279
was a big pain point for many years

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,880
throughout plasma 4 but also plasma 5

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,720
where in a setting like this people had

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,600
trouble connecting projectors

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
conveniently

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,839
or when they docked their laptop at work

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,320
they wouldn't remember the screen well

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,000
and things would jumble and jump around

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,079
a lot of progress was made on fixing

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,600
that

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,200
and yeah then we come to the consistency

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,959
improvements

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,120
this was i think a good third of the

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,519
work done over the last 18 months

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,399
where we went into tons of apps and the

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,440
plasma shell

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,959
and reworked the default settings um

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,079
often this meant just sort of reflecting

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,920
the status quo on

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,600
how kd software was actually deployed to

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
users um

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,279
as we are in upstream we work with

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
downstreams with linux distributions who

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,200
are in some cases

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,680
more directly user-facing than we are

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,279
and

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,360
the distributions get a lot of the

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,360
feedback from the users on on how users

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,160
actually prefer to use the system

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,360
and often distributions would then ship

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,959
different default settings from the

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,240
upstream ones

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,320
and a lot of this work was

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,839
looking at what had users demanded from

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,720
distributions and what was actually

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,519
popular

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
out there and getting better metrics on

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,160
how users

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,519
like to use kde software and then

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,839
adopting those things as

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,680
more reasonable defaults to ease the

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,079
maintenance person on the distributions

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,560
but

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,120
also for example to help developers

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,600
because

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
now when you install a plasma based

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,200
development system you get the same

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,560
settings that users actually use

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,120
and closer to the user and better able

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,680
to understand their needs

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,480
system settings which is the application

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,720
that you use in the kd plasma system to

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,920
manage your system settings obviously

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,000
but also

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,079
peripherals file sharing all these kinds

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,040
of things

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,760
was cleaned up we simplified a lot of

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,399
the

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,320
partly very old uis that go back

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,399
straight to kd2

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,839
we gave them a visual overhaul we made

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,760
them a lot more consistent

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,000
and many places a lot simpler without

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,959
losing any of the functionality just by

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,240
adapting

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,880
more modern ui patterns and

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,120
porting them to newer ui components we

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,399
had in the stack

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,040
um one of the more controversial perhaps

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,560
efforts

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,440
was aligning the shell and the apps more

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,920
closely

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,040
back when plasma started in the kde four

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,800
days

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,279
back then a very conscious decision was

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,040
made that shell and apps should have

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,560
separate theming systems and separate

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,360
looks

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,399
we decided to sort of walk that back we

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,240
felt that

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,680
that decision was at the time sort of

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,199
forced by the technology

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,120
where for the plasma shell we had a

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,240
different vector-based theming system

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,360
from widgets for the applications

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,320
as qml and qt quick become more popular

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,440
technologies

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,920
for applications to use and

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,880
as plasma 5 world of debris style which

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,399
was

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,240
much more simple to implement in qt

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,160
quick we finally had

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,839
sort of technological requirements to

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,120
have consistent visuals again between

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,240
the shell and the apps

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,000
and used the same theming throughout

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,440
this has been i think very well received

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,839
by users

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,360
so i think it was the right thing to do

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,959
and i'm very happy that the team worked

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,240
on that

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,199
and all together hundreds if not

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,120
thousands of

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,199
of bug fixes were made both in the

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,399
plasma shell but also all across the

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,519
applications

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,639
and many sort of awkward workflows

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,720
were cleaned up or improved for example

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,639
as you get a notification what you can

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,399
do with that notification what apps you

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,160
can directly open from the notification

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,360
or what actions you can take

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,560
um has been approved considerably

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,360
or use spectacle to take a screenshot be

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,199
able to jump

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,480
into all sorts of apps or sharing

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,160
workflows from there

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,600
these kinds of things which is exactly

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,240
what we wanted to accomplish with this

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,959
goal right

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,880
instead of tackling something specific

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,759
to one application or specific to the

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,440
shell

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,240
we want to make improvements all across

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,240
kde software

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,880
and all of this work i think has had a

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,320
huge impact

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,600
um on the kde community but also

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,560
on kde's relations to its user and

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,560
developer audience

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,480
before this goal came around

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,160
if you went into online discourse on kde

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,360
and plasma frankly it was sometimes

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,480
quite negative

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,399
um sort of the general tenor was i

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,040
really like this

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,480
but there's stability problems i ran

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,360
into bugs quickly

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,800
this default settings were not that

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,560
great and it took me a lot of time to

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,000
figure out how to change them

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,959
um this has spun around tremendously

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,360
where these days

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,120
if you jump in there you either see lots

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,240
of love for us

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,600
or at least people have perception of

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,839
great forward momentum

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,519
and they enjoy following what we put out

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,279
there

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,360
these days in general we are perceived

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,199
as sort of stable and nimble

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,720
uh during the kd4 days we got a lot of

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
criticism for our performance

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,360
um not just this goal but all of the

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,079
community pulled together to improve our

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,959
performance

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,959
and and so for example startup speed um

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,759
alish will give a talk later on plasma

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,800
startup speed and the work done there

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,600
so generally these days users perceive

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,959
as a stable

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,399
and performant people also enjoy using

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,640
this cover much more which is very

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,280
important because it allows us to

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,319
surface kde software to users

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,120
much more efficiently than before so in

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,600
general

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,039
i think the audience now has the feeling

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,520
that kde is moving again

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,039
and moving at greater pace than before

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,720
communicating regularly with the

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,760
audience is very important

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,600
in that sense and has helped a lot but

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,959
personally i think the greatest

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,799
accomplishment of the goal

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,720
and nate in particular and i want to

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,679
really thank him for the great job he's

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,799
done there

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,200
is that he has rallied a great new group

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,080
of contributors around this goal and

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,320
by extension around the kde community

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,520
when i went to the plasma sprint in june

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,080
that i mentioned earlier

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,120
as a plasma developer there were many

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,200
new faces there

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,720
for many people there it was their first

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,280
kde event ever

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,559
and immediately it felt like they had

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,480
always been there

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,039
which is amazing and

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,919
it's been just fantastic to see new

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,440
people pour in

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:09,360
do really great work grow really fast

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:14,160
and extend the team and the best thing

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,400
is that all of these new contributors

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,520
like this goal they work across the

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
whole community

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,559
these are not contributors that have

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,440
been attracted to work on a particular

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,120
app

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,880
they are contributors who feel like they

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,600
own all of the apps and improve all of

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,880
them

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,640
so i think in that sense

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,000
the goals have definitely accomplished

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,880
what we set out

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,799
to do when we came up with this we

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,200
wanted to work all across the community

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,679
again

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,679
we wanted to have new contributors who

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,400
identify with the kde community in that

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,320
way

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,720
and that has definitely come to pass

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,080
with this goal it's been wonderful

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,000
and along those lines

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,360
choosing complementary goals i think can

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,640
be very powerful

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,880
in this case the usability and

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,640
productivity goal was

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,000
very strongly aligned with the

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,919
onboarding goal

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,880
and they certainly informed each other

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,280
onboarding by itself as near futures

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,480
will

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,080
certainly talk about more i think had as

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,160
its goal to improve our developer

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,559
onboarding and our documentation

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,240
which we really needed for sort of our

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,000
goals in the usability and productivity

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,320
goal

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,760
and yeah we did that together and

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,760
it worked so that's great

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:39,840
all right that's all i got

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:55,919
any questions

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,559
thanks for your presentation in the

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,080
beginning

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,520
you mentioned that the first step

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,960
for the goal was to gather user feedback

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,720
also when i read the

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,760
blog posts of nade i saw many

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,799
new names many contributors that

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,520
at least at me looked new what's the

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,120
primary

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:25,120
platform that this contributor

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,480
came from web platform or something

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,720
i think interestingly

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,480
the way we got contributors this time is

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,120
not that different from the ways we got

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,360
contributors in the past

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,919
and i think it shows that we just sort

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,480
of need to keep going and and

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,240
and always do new things namely i think

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,520
nate's blog post got a lot of new people

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,760
involved

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,600
in the past in the kd community we had

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,640
something very similar called the kde

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,960
comet digest

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,080
which was a weekly publication of

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,039
ongoings

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,159
on the developer side and i myself

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,559
around 2005

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,200
became a kd contributor because i was

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,120
reading that

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,799
and i was excited by it and i wanted to

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,919
be one of the cool people in that

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,960
publication

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,840
so i think the lesson is that

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,360
blogging really helps for any project

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,480
for the community as a whole but also

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,880
for teams

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,559
if you show your forward progress and

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,240
you show your momentum and you show that

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,840
you have cool things going on

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,679
then people want to get involved with

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,480
that that's very important

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,880
and near futures i think is agreeing so

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,200
um

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,640
i think that was a big reason i think

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,039
another development

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,159
in the community has been a switch to

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,200
new communication

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,840
media ironically i think

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,480
the academy conference indirectly

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,159
spawned that

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,640
because many years ago for in academy

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,400
somebody opened a telegram channel to

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,000
allow people to communicate

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,760
more easily with their mobiles at the

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,400
conference and

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,400
from that developed the fact that our

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,000
communication in the community initially

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,520
fragmented between our old

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,120
chat media irc and telegram and a lot of

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,280
the new contributors came in via

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,400
telegram

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,600
this was a whole audience that sort of

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,039
got in bed with open source there

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,440
and hadn't been in touch with kde before

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,679
but as we started using telegram more

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,720
we were able to connect with them that's

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,320
sort of

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,080
a good thing and a bad thing because

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,000
telegram doesn't sort of satisfy all of

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,320
our requirements on the open source

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,840
side so we roll out matrix and we've

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,960
been bridging things and

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,240
see where this is going but clearly

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,200
we cannot sort of block progress in that

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,039
direction

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,960
in terms of communication media we need

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,720
to go where the developers are

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,880
and if telegram is popular then we

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,559
should be on telegram

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,559
to get them and i think that worked

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,840
okay anyway

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,159
just to cooperate this statement and we

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,039
have four years the kd brazil channel

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,679
is like average 20-25 persons last year

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,400
we just

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,919
bridge and make telegram we're over 300

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,200
in kde brazil channel

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,000
more than 300 inside the kd brazil

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,039
development

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,840
and then q2 brazil is over there

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,240
just because in one a year so it's

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,240
amazing yeah

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,840
okay so as we lack in time so you can

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:37,840
ask in person

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:37,840
to ike anytime thank you yeah thank you

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,760
