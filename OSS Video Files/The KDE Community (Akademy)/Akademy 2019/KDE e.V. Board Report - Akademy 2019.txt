	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,440
so um since last Academy we're doing KDE

00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,920
reports as part of the main program and

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,920
not only as part of the general assembly

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:20,630
and this is the first one for this year

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,960
which is the report of the board of KETV

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:28,099
since there's a bunch of new people here

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:31,189
if you don't notice KDE Eevee is the

00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:34,130
organization that supports KDE in

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:39,629
various matters financial legal

00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:43,230
organizational and so on and this

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:47,610
organization has a board and maybe we

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,950
start with you yes we do have a board as

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,370
you can see it traditionally has five

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,350
members there's only three here today

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,180
this is because Thomas five

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,609
unfortunately had a different commitment

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,530
and couldn't be here and and abets

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,930
recently for personal reasons had to

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,170
step down at least the three of us of

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,390
course our wonderful president Lydia

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:12,810
leash who has been on the board I think

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:22,409
nearly as long and me who joined two

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:25,020
years ago as treasurer so we are five we

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,950
want to continue being five so these

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,619
years two spots to to fill Thomases and

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,070
Andy so far we have four candidates

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,530
which is Ariel Castro either in the

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:41,329
grid-tie over and your photos

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,509
color guitarist and give them a hand

00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:44,509
thank you

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,060
well the vote will happen on the AGM on

00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:04,729
Monday so well think about what you're

00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:08,119
gonna vote all right one of the things

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:13,280
we noticed last year is that we had very

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:16,460
few new members joining Divi meaning too

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,640
and we decided to really do something

00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:22,790
about this and lots of people proposed

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:27,680
new members and so this year we have 17

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:40,690
new members who of you here is one of

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:40,690
them raise your hands yeah very cool

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,880
all right in keeping with the last slide

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,300
that means our overall member count has

00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,640
increased you can also see we have a

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,320
second class of members which individual

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,989
supporting members who pay for their

00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,000
membership who essentially provides a

00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:02,480
recurring donation to the organization

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,250
which we have a grateful for the number

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,080
of individuals supporting members has

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,590
gone down in the past year this was not

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,440
a nice thing fortunately I can say that

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,690
I expect this count to go up in the next

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,060
year we have a web application that we

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,580
used to handle the payments by

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,850
supporting members which is for late dot

00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:26,989
Katie dork that web app over the last

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:29,739
year has had a laundry list of issues we

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:32,360
have contracted contracted to help us

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:34,250
fix the issues with that website it's an

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,760
installation of CV CRM which many

00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:41,720
nonprofit organizations use to do CRM

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,130
and progress on fixing that has been

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,989
pretty good there's still some more work

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:49,610
to do it's an important topic for us to

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,680
expand the use of this web application

00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,889
and to make it more convenient to use

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,250
for prospective supporting members we

00:03:54,889 --> 00:04:00,470
want first off the issues to go away and

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,810
the teasing issues to be ironed out but

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,360
we also want to use it to engage better

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,300
with supporting members and allow them

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,580
both freedom and for example setting the

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:19,640
donation amount and we're working

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:21,950
towards that brilliant right well

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,190
besides the individuals meaning well

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:28,730
actual people there's some organizations

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,710
that also support us we have two

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,520
programs there there's the patrons and

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:37,160
the supporters so as patrons we have

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,680

00:04:44,810 --> 00:05:07,790
have possess come and get up thanks a

00:04:47,750 --> 00:05:12,080
lot we also have an advisory board since

00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:17,270
the year before us where organizations

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,880
and companies around us can join to get

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,419
a get closer to the KT community and

00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:28,850
have a closer connection to the KT

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:31,550
community so there are organizations

00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,160
like the FSF and the fsfe the open

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,960
source institute but also the city of

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,890
munich for example as one of the big

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,460
deployments a brill canonical and yoga

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:46,070
as a new patron to document foundation

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,290
for Nigeria's who's the cute company

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:52,760
Debian and private Internet access and

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,680
we have regular calls with and they have

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,500
a dedicated contact in the community

00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,240
that they can talk to and that updates

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,190
them on new things that might be

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,340
relevant that are happening in KDE for

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,340
them

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,500
and in addition to the advisory board we

00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:14,730
also have a number of community partners

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,650
Lix is an application community that

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:20,110
that does a document publishing

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,540
application that was founded by the same

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,420
person who also founded KDE so those two

00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,060
communities go way back and they

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:30,910
continue to be a partner of us today a

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,610
cute project which is the sort of open

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:37,390
source backing project for the cute

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,250
product and under meetings which is an

00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:44,590
association based in Switzerland that

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:47,680
has in the past organized a number of

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:50,580
important key events sort of the second

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,890
largest KT event of the year at the time

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,810
unfortunately in the last two years this

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:59,370
event has not been held in Switzerland

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,180
because of problems securing the venue

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,670
they have told us they're working

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,400
towards securing that again and

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,710
certainly I'm motivated to put that

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:14,470
event on again in the future so we're

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:18,550
looking forward to that and then there's

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:21,640
even more affiliations we have the local

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:26,710
organisations program which is only

00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,900
signed by TD Spain now but if you have

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,720
an organization in your country and you

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,550
would like to have an official

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,920
relationship with the KTV is something

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,260
we could look into reach out to us if

00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,080
you're interested then we have other

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:44,050
affiliates that are organisations that

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,800
are similar to ours which with which we

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:52,420
have a relationship like fsfe OSI and

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,810
the ion and then we're members of OSI an

00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:59,020
oasis which is the organization behind

00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:01,900

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:09,070
year which is a new thing we did some

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,630

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:32,610
sir sure alright um the board is and by

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,430
extension Davey and the community is

supported by Peter who you might have

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:41,630
seen running around here who helps us

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:45,330
with organizational and financial things

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:56,400
we have two contractors for marketing

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:57,930
Paul and Ivana you hear probably and one

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,510
Carlos Torres is helping us with

00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:03,839
improving documentation specifically he

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,220
started out as to get an overview of

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,910
what is actually our current state after

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:14,480
documentation right as we mentioned we

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,430
currently have two marketing contractors

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,490
this light is based on on the inputs

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,930
thank you very much for that we've been

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:26,250
working with them for several years now

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:29,670
their original mandate was to sort of

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,650
bring KD promo back to life and spur in

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,200
a new community around them and make ad

00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,480
promo an institution again in the KD

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,490
community that our various teams and

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,030
contributors could could go to to get

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:44,960
the message out there and improve the

00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:48,000
way we promote KD to the wider world

00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,830
they've continued to do that the team

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,480
has further consolidated it has further

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:57,480
grown and it has become easier for for

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,510
new people to join the program Everts by

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,730
documenting things better by making some

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,290
decisions on how access for example to

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,370
our various social media accounts is

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:14,160
doled out and writing down guidelines on

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:16,470
how to work with this media in parallel

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,810
to that work has continued KD promo team

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,750
has assisted many different teams in the

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:25,220
community by helping with writing work

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,420
by aiding developers in putting

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,130
publications together because blog post

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,160
beard videos and just

00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,990
generally any promotional related

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,700
publication that Katy does these days

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,180
tends to go through the promo group

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,820
which is great and promo also works

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,320
together with other organs that we have

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,790
in the community to get work done for

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,630
example the fundraising working group

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:52,950
and helps them promote fundraising

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:55,920
campaigns and so on the promo team has

00:10:52,950 --> 00:11:00,060
also in this year to write or past year

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,800
rather to help us connect to some large

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,590
organizations outside KDE

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:11,160
and and and maintain those relationships

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:13,620
and sort of widen the channel and been

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,840
just much more active than before on

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,970
social media in particular I mentioned

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,810
this earlier today during one of the

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:25,890
gold stocks that engaging with the user

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,870
audience around KDE more in deaths has

00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,300
helped that effort tremendously and can

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,300
you promo has certainly also been very

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,290
helpful in enabling that so thank you to

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,290
our property

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:52,430
we also had Juan Carlos hired to work on

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:55,970
documentation hiring is always kind of a

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:58,610
difficult topic especially when we reach

00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:01,490
out into tasks that were generally done

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,830
by community people albiet with we don't

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,029
hire somebody who like to do something

00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,570
that is already being done in the

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:12,980
community but but it's it's sensitive

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:15,890
sensitive in this case it was for

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,800
working on documentation and while this

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,740
approach was taken by finding somebody

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,630
to actually see not to actually work on

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,940
documentation directly but seeing what

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:30,950
actually needs doing and what how this

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,959
should be done which is actually what

00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:36,230
Juan Carlos did actually he finished on

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,070
June like we said earlier and at the

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,089
moment

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:44,690
well he's not hired anymore the next

00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:47,230
step would be to hire somebody beat him

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:50,930
or somebody else there should be

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,360
possibly a job offer

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:57,529
eventually before the end of the year

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,670
it's already budgeted right so yeah he

00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:03,100
looked into things like API

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:07,100
documentation wiki's onboarding and

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:10,339
defined some goals he wrote a report in

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,600
detailed report you can look at it on

00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:15,110
the community mailing list I think it

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,060
was right so well look at it reach out

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,800
to him if you have questions or discuss

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,200
it in the community or at academy that's

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,180
why we're here right but in general the

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,589
goal is let's have good documentation

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,589
for everyone right

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:42,670
all right Academy 2020 has getting the

00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,670
call for locations out for that has been

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,210
it is out now when we created the slice

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:57,380
but yes so it is out by now but for

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,690
various reasons it was very much later

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,190
than we would have liked to do this

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:05,450
because there was just so much to do for

00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:09,160
this Academy so we need to get the word

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:13,270
out for next year's Academy location

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:16,910
everywhere now so if you can help us

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:18,860
spread the word or if you're thinking

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,500
about hosting Academy next year please

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:24,410
come and talk to us please come and talk

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,580
to the Academy team we're happy to

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,580
answer any questions you have

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:50,360
yes please do share it and to consider

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:54,770
gathering some people around you to host

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,930
it yourself if you could yeah and in

00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,250
general this year has shown us that we

00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,260
have to increase the number of people

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,040
who are helping with tasks leading up to

00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:06,920
Academy so if you're have some spare

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,270
cycles for helping with Academy 2020

00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,270
that would be amazing

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:18,650
alright kdv of course exists to help

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,050
support the KDE community in its various

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:24,050
endeavors one of the most important

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:27,170
things that KETV does is help organize

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:30,250
and in particular fund various kt

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:33,590
development sprints and other events

00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:36,140
this year rather than the last year and

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,720
this year we had quite a few sprints

00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,980
we still want more sprints but let's

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,339
look at the list of things that has

00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,760
happened so far we had two KDE part

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:46,100
sprints

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,250
year one in January in South Korea and

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,700
then the second one co-located with the

00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:54,380
plasma sprint this June in February the

00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,210
plasma mobile team had I think their

00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,210
first spirit if I'm not mistaken and

00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:01,180
that team came together and did some

00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:04,940
great work there to move that forward

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,630
then in March we had the first go sprint

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,460
of the year

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,860
as we talked about earlier in the day

00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,810
the community elected three goals about

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,720
18 months ago and each goal was

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:17,900
guaranteed to have a sprint funded to

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,760
advance their agenda the privacy student

00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,710
happened in Leipzig and even talked

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,790
about it a bit in a bit more detail

00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:28,250
earlier today then a staple of the KDE

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,410
community is the annual pimp sprint they

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,350
I think without failed on it for

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:35,870
probably over a decade now in April they

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,700
did it again in France and from the blog

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:41,840
posts I read it was a good time and

00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:45,080
productive once again Valencia was very

00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,870
interesting in June we had three sprints

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,260
co-located there the first one was the

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,850
portsmen dimension then leading into the

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,030
plasma and the usability and

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:58,580
productivity sprint I was there I was at

00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,920
all three it was a wonderful time I

00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,990
think co-locating the usability and

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,300
productivity and plasma screens was a

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,839
great idea we had two rooms there we

00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,990
could separate on merge as needed

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,400
situationally so that was great then

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,110
following that in July there was another

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,630
mega sprint I think it was called

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,329
earlier in the day where we had another

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,920
girl sprint the onboarding sprint

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,350
co-located with the KDE connect Sprint's

00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,480
in the student showcase we had a great

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,560
presentation about porting KDE connect

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,610
windows KDE connect has been

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,040
fantastically popular can you project

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,140
this year that went far beyond the

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,180
immediate KDE community so it's great to

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:42,400
see it being spread to new platforms as

00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:46,100
well and I think the possibly first ever

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,100
Quinn sprint that was great that

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:51,530
happened it probably helped maybe get

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,930
the valent goal elected this year as a

00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,430
lot of valent related work needs to be

00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,620
done in quinn which is our window

00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:00,559
manager and the way we put ours

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,120
on screens everywhere so I'm sure this

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,070
wasn't the last twin sprint and

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:08,720
hopefully already planning the next one

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:10,730
and finally critter critter is painting

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,919
an illustration up that the community

00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:16,220
has been making for a long time

00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:19,460
critter has seen an enormous adoption

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:23,500
curve over the last few years that is

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:26,600
the fruit of very concerted and an

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,490
amazing labor and I think the creatures

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,440
burned this year was by far the largest

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,750
they've ever done I think more than

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,490
twice as big as the one they did in the

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:39,440
previous year it was very well attended

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:44,510
I think also by new people and they had

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,789
a good time from everything I heard but

00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:51,740
we don't organize everything we do we

00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:54,409
also enjoy the going to other people's

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,299
events and while attending and talking

00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:59,120
to people there and telling them what we

00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:01,580
do sometimes by giving a presentation

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,140
sometimes by having a booth we went to

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,559
first time actually we generally go to

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:10,789
first time every day every year for a we

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:14,029
also went to Kidwell summit just dudes

00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:17,270
commercial kind of conference xdc which

00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:20,360
is like Academy but 4x and Wayland

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,760
people ELC which is the first time we

00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,140
had some kind of relationship with a

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,820
Linux Foundation that was kind of

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,029
interesting wasn't there though but I

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,980
heard really nice things you said mental

00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:34,179
summit which is something somewhere we

00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:37,669
get to go because we are one of the

00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:40,130
organizations print out live which is

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:44,870
organized by free note in the UK and

00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:47,270
well I hear it's a nice big conference

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,730
where to talk to about free and open

00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,520
source projects post Asia which is in

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:55,820
Asia and we need to be there as well

00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,909
first off in sweden and kid come Brazil

00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,669
which is in Brazil and they talked about

00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:04,090
kid we are all there with one or more

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:04,090
people

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,920
and of course we also organized our own

00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:17,390
conferences which was Academy in the

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:20,720
last year and Academy all right

00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,460
fundraising fundraising is dedicated

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,250
working group that the Evie has the

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,860
fundraising working group will give its

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:32,120
own report in the slot following this so

00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:35,450
I'll not preemptive their content I will

00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:39,080
say that we are very glad that we got a

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:41,570
new patron to kdv this year which is in

00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,490
yoga how to Couture they also joined our

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,370
advisory board as mentioned earlier we

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,380
look really forward to just deepening

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,490
that very new relationship over the

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:54,860
coming years hopefully and look forward

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,650
to staying in close contact and learning

00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:01,370
from them

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:04,430
handshake donations in 2018 we got very

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:07,360
large donation from handshake which is a

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:10,190
crypto DNS crypto coin kind of thing and

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,760
they gave large donations to many open

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,870
source organizations those were three

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,940
hundred thousand dollars total

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:21,680
about a hundred thousand of those for a

00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:25,970
year marked for caligra community KD

00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:28,520
project KD team decided to earmark 10%

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,410
of that to creat a we're still in the

00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,990
process of figuring out the legal sides

00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,820
of how to actually give that money to

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,610
critter we've made some progress on that

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,010
and financial working group present some

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,510
more details on that later

00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,970
as mentioned earlier we've been

00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:47,360
contracting out work to fix up and

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,760
improve related Keadle org which is how

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,160
we engage with our supporting pain

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,920
supporting members to the Eevee

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,250
this slide goes into some more detail on

00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,020
the work that has been going on there

00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,760
most importantly fixing all the teasing

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,950
issues with the people integration after

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,880
they change the API so that recurring

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:09,290
payments from PayPal work again and

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,180
we're getting close to allowing donors

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,560
to set their own amounts which other

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,080
organizations have reported great

00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,480
success with sort of improving their

00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,190
well fundraising because a lot of people

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:24,530
out there are fortunately already

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:26,870
very generous and we aim to put more

00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:30,020
effort into that and grow that sort of

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,700
pathway for fundraising and we

00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,480
intentionally didn't put on an

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:37,520
end-of-the-year campaign in 2018 and I

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,720
think the decision is still out for this

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,270
year historically the end-of-the-year

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,660
campaign was a great income source for

00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:51,260
the KDE community 4k TV we've been very

00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:54,980
fortunate on on patronage on individual

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,080
donations and on large unexpected single

00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,330
donations from organizations like

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:03,740
handshake that we sort of didn't need to

00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:05,920
go to that well we didn't need to to go

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,920
out there and fundraise via campaigns

00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,920
yep

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:27,880
well as every year there's a kdv

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:31,310
community report promo was working on

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,280
the one for this year I don't know if we

00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:36,020
announce it yet I don't think we did but

00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,090
well it's there

00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:46,160
you can take a look at it it will be

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:51,250
announced soon in everywhere all right

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:53,870
and then we spent the morning on it

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,950
which is we concluded the first round of

00:23:53,870 --> 00:24:02,020
the goals with the session this morning

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:05,720
we had sprints as we had promised the

00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:10,310
how did this morning what did he call it

00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:13,310
the goal goalkeeper goal keeper as we

00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:16,430
promised each of the goalkeepers and we

00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:18,440
friend an open process for proposing and

00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:25,150
selecting the new goals and we have new

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:28,460
goals all right

00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:30,170
everybody report so far has ended with a

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,640
list of things we hope to accomplish in

00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,710
the coming year

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,570
we did that last year it's time to

00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,150
follow up on whether we follow through

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:41,180
on them we did promise there would be an

00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:43,160
academy this year I think all of your

00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:46,640
guys presence is ample evidence that

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:50,780
we've managed to achieve that it was a

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,720
bit of a struggle this year I think part

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:58,340
of that was coming out of Academy 2018

00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:00,350
which was relatively speaking a breeze

00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,300
because we had the location in Vienna

00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,240
very early on which gave us a lot of

00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,990
time to organize that conference the

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,280
timetable this year was considerably

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:14,270
shorter we got the location very late

00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:16,550
and that made it quite difficult to put

00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,320
everything together in time I think it

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,030
came out well and thanks so much

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,480
everybody who contributed to that and

00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,920
came through to that s said on an

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,530
earlier slides

00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:31,670
hopefully we can get the location for

00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:36,160
20/20 earlier this time and save some of

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:41,390
that pain all right then

00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:44,060
in 2017 at that Academy we came up

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,590
together with the gold system we did the

00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:49,520
election following that Academy we

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:51,950
elected goals we promised that we would

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,980
keep working on that we would figure out

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,560
the succession there the succession plan

00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:02,060
that is when and how to elect the new

00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:06,410
goals perform that election get those

00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:09,050
goals elected that also happened glad

00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:11,270
that it happened oh whoa I think the

00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,640
feedback today has been that first goals

00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,810
have worked out really well and

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,850
hopefully we can apply the lessons

00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:22,940
learned to the next round and make those

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:28,220
even better we realized over the past

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:29,690
year that as in particular goals worked

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,120
out really well and the perception

00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:35,150
around KDE has improved again that we've

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,920
been approached by many new partners you

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:39,560
saw this at last year's Academy when

00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,120
quite a few hardware companies ended up

00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,980
coming to the conference sponsoring the

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,260
conference and taking a more active

00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:50,360
interest in us that's that's we've

00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:55,000
succeeded in making KD more attractive

00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,000
for design bins out there and

00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,360
increasingly there's men as the board

00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,070
we've been contacted by some of these

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,560
partner companies and they've asked us

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,270
hey we want to do something with KDE we

00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,400
want to have KDE stuff in our product

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,950
but we need some work on that done and

00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,810
we're not quite sure how to go about

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:14,750
getting that work done is there anybody

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,940
who does KT work for pay and of course

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,530
we do have those partners in our

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,660
ecosystem we do have wonderful

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:23,450
consultancies and also individual

00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,540
consultants were very well able to

00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:29,990
commercially support KD technology we

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:33,200
wanted to sort of surface that better

00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:36,680
so the EB worked together on setting up

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,570
a consultancies program and putting that

00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,540
on the Eevee's website and

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:44,900
the process for how companies and

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,730
individuals can get on there we plan to

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,310
build on that in the future and

00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,930
hopefully advertise those consultancies

00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,610
in new places

00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,640
perhaps the cute marketplace that we

00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:57,560
heard about earlier and we want to

00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,920
continue working with these partners and

00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:05,960
and make sure that their needs are met

00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:08,180
and that they're happy to continue to

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,490
work in our ecosystem and that KT

00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,050
technologies work well for them the

00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:22,100
advisory board mentioned earlier is an

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:24,830
important place for that yeah one of the

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,620
problems with realized in the past is

00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:32,330
that HR as in human resources is not

00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:35,380
trivial we wanted to work further on on

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:38,540
on improving the different processes on

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:43,310
well on the end on the one hand hiring

00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:46,670
new new people and then when they're in

00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:48,710
keeping them around and and happy and

00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:52,460
making sure that we're doing the whole

00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:57,110
paperwork around it or correct because I

00:28:52,460 --> 00:29:00,110
mean legal things are not easy we did a

00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,720
whole lot of that actually Andy had a

00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:06,760
big background on HR and he was able to

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:10,360
give us well out of his experience his

00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:13,730
his present service was really useful

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,860
another point we we had last year like

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:18,380
Lydia mentioned earlier is that we

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,900
didn't have that many new people we had

00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,390
quite a lot of new people this year so

00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,780
yeah also remember too that you need to

00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:28,820
keep doing that inviting valuable people

00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,300
from the community to the AV is

00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,300
important

00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:39,590
yeah so that brings us to what do we

00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:42,860
need to do for the coming year right

00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:47,840
this is not the to-do list of the board

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:50,390
this is TV and the community at large

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,010
and of course we a support will will

00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:58,910
have a significant part in that the

00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:02,210
first thing we're gonna do is a host

00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:07,280
Academy next year with at least 150

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:10,809
attendees for which the first step as

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,809
we've been saying is finding a location

00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:19,640
the second thing we were talking about

00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:22,309
for a while is that you and everyone

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,049
else in this community is what makes

00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:28,520
this work right what what is most

00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:31,580
important to Katie and last year we

00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:35,450
started investing more in our people by

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,820
doing trainings at Academy and we want

00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:41,150
to do more of that we don't yet know how

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,490
exactly but we have to go that we find

00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:47,120
at least two ways to do that if you have

00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:52,840
ideas we're more than happy to hear

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:55,640
about them the third thing we said is

00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,720
that a lot of organizations around us

00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,040
and people get more and more concerned

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:05,990
rightfully about the environment and

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:09,080
what their role is in improving the

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,990
current situation how how do we make our

00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:15,790
work more sustainable environmentally

00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:19,660
and there has been discussions around

00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:22,880
drafting an environmental responsibility

00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:25,760
policy for levy

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,350
we don't have an agreed-upon draft yet

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,480
and we want to get there and and trial

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:36,620
that for four six months to see how that

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:41,440
affects our work and how that looks in

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:45,500
practice and the fourth point we have is

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,570
increasing the support networks

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,240
increasing the effectiveness of the

00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:52,640
board support network the board can't do

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,330
all the work on its own and it doesn't

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,180
there are working groups and task forces

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,050
around it that support the board and

00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:07,130
they be at large

00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:09,050
in specific tasks and those have over

00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,870
time grown kind of organically and I

00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:14,350
it's time to revisit that and look at

00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,280
okay what is the role and

00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:19,370
responsibilities of each of those and

00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,620
have conversations around well how can

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:25,400
we how can we improve that and we want

00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:34,610
to sit down with each of the groups and

00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:36,350
and talk about that all right so as you

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:39,260
will see in a moment in the in the

00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:42,860
working group reports our annual income

00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:45,680
situation has improved quite a lot our

00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,690
annual income and the past year was more

00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,600
than three times of what we have

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,640
averaged in the years prior we are a

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,670
nonprofit organization our mandate is to

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,740
put our resources towards the goals of

00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,020
the organization which is of course to

00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:03,020
support the KDE community that means we

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:06,290
need to find ways to spend our

00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,850
accumulated funds we've made some

00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:11,990
progress on that this year there is much

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:13,910
more to do for example we want to help

00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:17,060
the Gould's spent their allocated

00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:22,190
budgets better than has happened in the

00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:24,380
first round so far it is a bit tricky

00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,300
the board can't do this all by itself

00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,340
for one because we don't really work

00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,100
top-down like that we need to help of

00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,770
the financial working group to help

00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,600
rally the community around doing that we

00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:39,770
need your input we need your ideas and

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,990
your energy keep being aware there are a

00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:46,840
lot of resources available come up with

00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:50,660
new ideas champion them help us a

00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:52,370
continual challenge for board work is to

00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,390
find enough time to document the way we

00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:58,040
do this this is very important because

00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,030
if anything the legacy that any board

00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,860
member will eventually

00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:04,240
leave behind is the documentation

00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:07,280
succession is very important for kdv to

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,760
remain a stable and and well-oiled

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,460
organization so we definitely want to

00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,620
make it an important goal in the coming

00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:19,400
year to document at least two of our

00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:22,580
processes ideally more knowledge was

00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,580
talking about how much help you receive

00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:28,810
from nd during his presence on the board

00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:31,070
in the matter of HR he was a

00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:33,800
professional HR person who was very

00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:37,520
knowledgeable about that and helped us

00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:40,250
improve our legal documents in the area

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,270
of contracts to get us started working

00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:46,340
on an employee handbook and we want to

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:49,990
continue the work he has started and put

00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:52,909
some effort into that we want to

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:56,179
increase the way we partner with other

00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:59,690
organizations around us both nonprofits

00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:02,570
as well as commercial entities as H

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:05,090
mentioned earlier that this year we are

00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:08,270
hosting a new conference or rather the

00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:10,220
second iteration but renamed of the

00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:13,610
Linux app summit previously it was the

00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:17,480
Libra absolute this conference this

00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:22,190
event is about promoting and improving

00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,560
the Linux application ecosystem so we

00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:27,920
have many application developers in our

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,420
community that target not just the KDE

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,130
plasma desktop but also other

00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:36,200
open-source platforms and that means

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,200
that conferences for you and you should

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,780
come there you should engage there and

00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:45,130
learn from known and hopefully they also

00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:48,290
learn from us and everybody's happy and

00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:52,280
this year we had already provided a lot

00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:55,370
of in person meetings with KT partner

00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,220
organizations some that approached us

00:35:55,370 --> 00:36:01,070
others that we approached we expect this

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,780
to continue we will continue to have the

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:06,740
board sprints in the next year and we

00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:10,100
will try our best to co-locate them with

00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,700
meetings of that sort and look very much

00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,700
forward to that

00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,769
you can always talk to us we are super

00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:23,369
nice people we have a mailing list

00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:28,019
there's an IRC channel we are on all of

00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:34,940
the Internet's don't hesitate to reach

00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:34,940
out to us and say something thank you

00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:51,380
also here we're at Academy for the next

00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:54,590
few days so yeah well it kind of makes

00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,840
sense right like you can say maybe I

00:36:54,590 --> 00:37:00,020
cannot go and talk to the president

00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,140
while you can see she smiles all the

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,140
time

00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:21,590
so questions so you said we got 17 new

00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:24,830
members for KTV last year so my question

00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:29,960
would be why should anybody who is not

00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:33,530
yet in the Evy join TV and what does one

00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:37,460
have to do to join the Evy I think that

00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:38,450
you can answer this question I mean we

00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:48,880
can do it

00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:51,740
you're also a kid II remember all right

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,050
well the kid is very important because

00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:57,320
it's the organization that holds all of

00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:58,610
the servers that host all our code and

00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,160
our communications

00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:04,790
so without the servers for starters

00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,160
there's no software for us to do or ways

00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,600
for us to communicate in and what in

00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,510
general it's about communication and

00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:14,030
about having a legal entity that will

00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:16,790
able to back the work that we're doing

00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:20,360
us as contributors as software

00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:24,140
developers and otherwise the way to you

00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:27,530
want explain well I'm going to channel

00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:30,080
new cohere who said something very

00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:32,450
salient to me at some point I think it

00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:36,880
was in 2017 when we decided on the whole

00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:39,620
goal system his point was that you

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,900
always have governance in a community

00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,790
like ours

00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:46,160
if you don't define it if you don't

00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:48,170
engage with it then government and still

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,920
happens just very randomly and

00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:53,819
uncontrolled and not very efficiently we

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,809
try to do it better than that and

00:38:53,819 --> 00:39:01,499
KTV is to some extent the organ we have

00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:04,410
for that the gold system realizing it

00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:07,920
was substantially done by kdv members

00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:10,140
and by the KTV board so if you want to

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,440
improve the community and want to

00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,569
improve how KD does things then joining

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,699
the V is the right place to be it's

00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:19,739
where a lot of important work gets

00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:21,749
organized it's where some important

00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:24,420
decisions get made occasionally very

00:39:21,749 --> 00:39:27,479
important votes happen for these things

00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,039
to happen in a healthy manner the

00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:31,650
membership of the V needs to be a

00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:34,799
healthy representative sampling of the

00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:36,630
community it aims to support so if you

00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:39,869
care about KDE and if you care about

00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:42,709
KETV making good decisions for you then

00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:44,640
you should be in the membership of kdv

00:39:42,709 --> 00:39:46,890
and the second part of the question

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,130
which is how to become a member you need

00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:52,619
to find a key remember and tell them

00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,059
propose me or and then he will give you

00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:57,509
a set of questions that you will answer

00:39:54,059 --> 00:40:00,660
and he will send them to the membership

00:39:57,509 --> 00:40:03,569
the membership will decide if it makes

00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:06,839
sense for you to be or if they want you

00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:10,499
to be a member which I mean usually it

00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:14,940
makes sense like it's not about you're

00:40:10,499 --> 00:40:16,440
very angry people but what you need to

00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,019
be committed and and parts of the

00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,859
community before becoming a member

00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:25,229
once the membership process is done then

00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:32,359
you become a member it's for free

00:40:25,229 --> 00:40:32,359
there's no fee or anything so do it

00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:59,550
haha did I say it wrong

00:40:41,240 --> 00:41:03,390
well I'm sorry thank you and we have one

00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:05,700
more question coming from up here the KD

00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,380
India group has been inactive since a

00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,970
year or two and there hasn't been any

00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,550
convert KD row teens in the past two

00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:14,130
years including this year so how can we

00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:17,160
improve the conditions for this middle I

00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:25,140
mean know what are we looking at for KD

00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:28,290
India future so mostly we have been

00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,200
trying to organize conquering from like

00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:33,840
lush one or two years so mostly it's

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,910
been about finding a right venue and

00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:43,320
right time so I mean like I tried I

00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:46,620
tried finding two venues and once it was

00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,270
because University exams which we can we

00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:51,540
could not she drew it properly and uh

00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:54,630
and the second time it was kind of quite

00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:57,120
too late to finish all the process and

00:41:54,630 --> 00:42:00,300
organize events so it's so mostly about

00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:03,480
if you know the location just feel free

00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,410
to reach out to me or someone from the

00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,410
