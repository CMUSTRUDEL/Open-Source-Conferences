I'd welcome all my friend said to the

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:09,660
Academy buff wrap-up for Thursday

00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:12,030
because of the day trip we had yesterday

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to be calling on the Wednesday

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,619
buffs first just so that we can have

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,210
complete coverage and then we'll do

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:25,680
Thursday after that looking at the

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,260
schedule for Wednesday we had signing

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:34,530
keys not so much key signing as signing

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:36,600
our artifacts remember that handled yeah

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,700
we talked about signing and it's super

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,649
important and we've come up with a plan

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,500
on how to optimize things a bit more

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:51,510
which should make things even greater

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:54,000
that's about it much greater the next

00:00:51,510 --> 00:01:00,239
Wednesday morning Boff was Wayland user

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,160
feedback got problems with Weiland yes

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,060
it was Wayland user feedback but also

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,650
Quinn in the beginning and so first we

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,110
talked about and we cleaned off about

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,560
plasma Valen start just in general like

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,369
how to start it and always a venn how to

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,450
debug it right so very much plea

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:20,970
possibilities how to start and how to

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,450
debug it and so we showed some

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:29,970
possibilities and then we talked about

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:32,220
the current progress on issues we need

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,119
to tackle and it's just which are still

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,970
open for example some people from Crete

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,430
over there and they said that they need

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,240
Penn support but also color management

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,850
so this is something just good to know

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,560
or you knew it already but seeing that

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,710
they are interested in it motivates us

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,899
to go further them and going further the

00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,780
valent is now one of your fishy goals

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,630
and we talked about how to organize the

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,369
work on that like on fabricator but I

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,979
was on the wiki and so often Weiland is

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,410
all only talked with in regards to Quinn

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,060
but actually

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,170
although all the applications for

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:23,760
clients which is important to have good

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:26,970
support where as well and even was is

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,510
where was so kind to take this part over

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,420
and organize in this direction and David

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,780
Edmondson and me we will try to cover

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:45,840
the Quinton and Plasma part and organize

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:47,750
fail all right thanks Roman next up in

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,100
the buff list is the sysadmin Baath

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:55,380
system in all the things he's been good

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,540
evening so we had a very productive both

00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,550
when we kind of started out by going

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,950
through the list of everything we have

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,440
and the very first thing we discovered

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,450
from us was that people didn't actually

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,930
realize all the things we have we have a

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,640
discoverability problem and so from

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,620
there we went and looked at what do we

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,180
have in terms of pointing people to the

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,760
things we have and we discovered that

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,980
they were gaping holes in it and it's

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,360
inconsistent and all those other sorts

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,460
of things that go along so we've come up

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,870
with a plan now to go through and

00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,390
essentially replace those bits and

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,470
pieces with something that's a bit more

00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,390
cohesive and actually covers everything

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,470
so all the things we have can be

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,690
discovered and actually used by people

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,580
because it would be really awesome if

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,610
people actually use the full extent of

00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,070
the stuff we maintain because otherwise

00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,740
we're just wasting effort for no benefit

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,450
to the community after that we moved on

00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,360
to a kind of overview of the various

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,190
providers we used and it was discovered

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,890
that we did actually have one or two

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,420
systems that are personally donated by

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,670
people rather than being donated by

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,760
organizations so we are going to look

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,220
hit given the status of how the k-t

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,520
communities are fairly well moving away

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,740
from those so those people are no longer

00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,140
essentially individually donating every

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,700
month to the community without being

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,000
part of a program that gets seemd

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,230
recognition like join the game following

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,890
on that from that we had a discussion

00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:22,830
around API doc a dork which is held

00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,229
together by the summary was blue tech

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,610
bubble gum and a bit of duct tape we

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,830
work through some solutions that could

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,650
be

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,479
used to potentially replace that and the

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,389
seems to move us to a situation where

00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,770
things are a lot more easy not only for

00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:39,419
developers and other contributors to the

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:42,069
community to maintain but also to

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,780
generally from our perspective look

00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:45,550
after the long run because the current

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,639
set-up isn't sustainable at all and

00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,150
basically is limping along and its

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,150
current form

00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,639
speaking of discoverability I discovered

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,889
there were cool things going on in the

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,940
nitrix community and fortunately they

00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:14,110
had AB off about it

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:17,219
butI yeah so this is our second Academy

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:22,020
this is the second time that we attained

00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:28,050
this KT event and this year we presented

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:31,060
CNX and we presented also in partially

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:34,569
showcase one of our new features in the

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,490
distribution she's called BMB metal we

00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:41,830
also talked about a little bit about

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:44,289
synth we think that seeing this

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,569
especially useful for developers because

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:50,620
it allows to use docker images and

00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:53,889
basically create I saw bootable ISO

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,159
images with a simple configuration using

00:05:53,889 --> 00:06:01,330
trap ECI

00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:05,409
and we also were able to present we

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:10,180
project more updates to it it's I think

00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:14,400
it's very interesting that the KDE

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:18,460
community has accepted my we create as a

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,550
as part of the breaks that are under the

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:24,069
umbrella of KD it's got a lot of

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,039
attention and hopefully we can see more

00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:30,490
contributions to it so that we can start

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,490
to use it way more and in our

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:39,130
distribution in and other distributions

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:40,360
I also talked up a little bit about app

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:46,599
images

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:50,080
and and if you weren't aware of nitrix

00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:52,740
we specifically use up images as the

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,270
main way to obtain your software

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,240
completely ditching the traditional

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:02,439
package management which is why also we

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,889
have c NX c NX is basically our

00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:08,129
operating systems manager and which we

00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:11,020
also release as an app image and

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:14,020
hopefully we could present the new

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:17,110
updates to see NXT my way project to be

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:26,439
metal and synth and whatever we come up

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:28,479
next next year's Academy alright thank

00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:30,430
you or thee moving on to the next

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,520
bathroom there's Quinn but you've

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,900
already talked about Quinn so let's move

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,759
on to privacy

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,759
nobody knows who ran the privacy ball

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,610
that's private

00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:51,039
yeah the privacy buff was mostly about

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:54,069
forming the team and more advanced so

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:58,089
actually we're speaking about that we

00:07:54,069 --> 00:08:01,389
want to have an blog post every two

00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:05,139
months and heaven also an online meeting

00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:08,710
on IRC every two weeks to actually catch

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:11,349
up and give on with the goal and then we

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,560
were discussing a lot of topics where we

00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:19,449
could improve privacy in our programs

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:23,050
and yeah the time was short and it was

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:27,509
shortly before the day trip so we had to

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,509
stop and go on thinking

00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:35,750
thanks Sango oh I just talks to you

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,279
didn't I

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,120
on the other side of privacy there's the

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:46,130
all the online accounts integration and

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:49,860
I think Dan was running online accounts

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,450
but so we looked into what online

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,640
accounts currently are and what we can

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,800
do with them we looked into all the

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,070
possible services that we could add into

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,510
the online accounts we looked into

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,390
keeping plugins which all seem to have

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,250
very advanced account configuration for

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,110
each of the online services they support

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:12,390
so this could be nice they all migrated

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:14,760
into K accounts we discussed how we can

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,290
improve the current UI so it's less

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,870
horrible how we can share code with

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,180
plasma mobile because they obviously

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,490
need some accounts settings as well and

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,470
they already have something and finally

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,560
we agreed that it would be great if we

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:32,510
could join some mega sprint again and

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,510
hack their once we have more ideas

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,620
[Applause]

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:43,950
that wraps it up for Wednesday moving on

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:50,250
a Thursday I've got a whole bunch of qml

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:57,110
workshops that ran all day so me in

00:09:50,250 --> 00:10:01,529
Camino and Dimitri did a session of

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:04,350
training about human just email first so

00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:09,750
the the very basic the very basic

00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:13,709
concepts and then moved to how to use it

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:19,620
with Craig ami we shown examples and

00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:24,360
made made people do those very very

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:28,770
simple example hello world applications

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:35,550
on on their computer and see what were

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:39,330
the main problems that a new user can

00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:44,400
encounter them that training session was

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:47,120
kind of interesting because there at the

00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:51,750
beginning there were not just KD people

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:56,610
that was also open to students for the

00:10:51,750 --> 00:11:01,380
university it was it was it was

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:07,920
advertised there the results of that are

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:10,740
interesting and mixed so for all the

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:16,740
morning there were there were around six

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:21,360
people from the University very beginner

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:26,339
level developer they they were

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:30,600
interested they have taken notes for all

00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:36,209
day but kind of felt a bit intimidated

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,880
by us so that is this is definitely one

00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:42,360
area that we can improve on and is

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:48,040
definitely a kind of thing that I would

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:51,400
like we try to do on on each new Academy

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:55,600
try to involve in kind of training

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:59,230
session things as much as external

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,650
people that we can if you own academies

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:05,320
at university it's it's the right

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,420
environment and maybe also during

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,570
sprains something like that maybe

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:14,940
organized and so we get better at that

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,940
and we get better at getting new people

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:22,630
[Applause]

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:28,600
thanks Marco plasma mobile continued

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:30,940
always so to be fair we didn't actually

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:36,970
use much of this bomb because the

00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:40,840
workshop was still going on but we

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:44,410
mostly hacked on that the different

00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:47,290
various hardware bits and yeah I think

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,910
most of the box was actually killing ami

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:56,320
applications for mobile application

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:57,370
development box as you can tell yeah all

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,960
right thanks

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,000
moving on to the next room in the

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:07,720
morning we had an internationalization

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:14,350
Boff run by Albert's and Luigi isn't

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:16,150
here so I will use a web page for

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,080
translations like online online

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,690
tradition too

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,400
we know that we acknowledge that we also

00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,740
know that there's sort of our Korean

00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:38,140
translators and unwanted so we need to

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:41,560
make it will be easier to also use from

00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:47,650
the online tool yeah just work to do

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:50,860
there it's not very easy to continue to

00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:54,960
keep itself which is not really our eye

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,950
of concern but it is because we're using

00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,460
translations from kids so it's it's also

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:08,940
good that we have a quality

00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:13,430
that kid this morning and he says to

00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,430
talk to you and make things better

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,149
[Applause]

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:25,200
thanks Albert I see on the schedule a

00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:31,230
whole long workshop off run by lays on

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:33,930
mapping KDE we only use the morning as

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:37,110
what because I think that we were able

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:40,770
to do that kind of fast the idea of

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:44,640
these mapping was to build a mind map

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:48,660
about the KDE community so we could see

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:51,510
uh all the for the supergroups working

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,120
group whose divisions any kind of that

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,310
and see where we are kind of missing

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,190
some efforts for so for example one of

00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:01,160
the things that we got was that the

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:04,170
community working group could connect

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:08,520
more with the local working groups like

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:10,589
this pain Brazil and India and so I

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,380
invited you all to check you on the link

00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:15,240
on the group I will put on they're both

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:17,279
scheduled to take a look at the mind

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,560
maps here with his missus something if

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,300
you if you can add something so you all

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,130
can see how they structure their and

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:29,700
know our community better so we can

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:33,930
continue growing thank you and that's

00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:36,000
how we discover what happens in KDE all

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:42,480
about the apps kick off lydia and

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:45,300
jonathan we had a session to discuss

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,300
some of the definitions of our new goal

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,459
all about the apps some of the four

00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,089
outcomes and then start on all the

00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:56,910
different tasks which will put on a to

00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,380
do board and and create sounds for

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:03,089
people to communicate and create a bit

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:07,310
of a team and and hopefully take Kitty's

00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:07,310
apps to a wider audiences

00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:18,230
thank you bringing audiences to KDE is

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:23,209
another topic we have Katie Katie no

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:28,870
sorry Kay itinerary extractor scripts or

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:28,870
digging through Bhushan's inbox right so

00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:36,620
push and desperately wanted to learn how

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:38,350
to write January extractor script so he

00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:42,380
was perfectly on time and we went

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,630
through the the data types you might

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:48,949
encounter there the the tools and the

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:50,839
API is so that at least some people in

00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:53,740
the both managed to write a few custom

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,540
extractor scripts during that hour

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:59,660
there's a small slide tech linked in the

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,220
in the notes is the stuff we looked at

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,580
and I think that's it

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,569
do you want to add something

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:10,850
[Applause]

00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:21,319
moving on there's a flat packs and snaps

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:23,839
thing run by young so both have a mostly

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:28,100
discussed topic we discussed a few

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:31,929
topics so one of them work or was Katie

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:34,729
run time we currently maintain one

00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:37,190
version of the run time with gilt 5.12

00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:41,119
which is being updated to cute

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:43,309
five-point 12.5 and then we are going to

00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,720
have another version of the run time

00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:49,999
which is going to use kids 5.14 and then

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,479
you freedo stress top run time which was

00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:55,399
released two days ago and the plan with

00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:59,179
this run time is also that we are going

00:17:55,399 --> 00:18:02,179
to move cute weapon Jean to a separate

00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:05,389
extension which will improve build time

00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:08,109
a lot and the size of the run time is

00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:10,940
right now it's quite big and also

00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:13,309
usually fails to build inferred hop

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:17,179
because of the benzene and not enough

00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:19,940
memory and stuff and then in future

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:23,149
because cute six is going to happen in

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:26,119
next year we'll have some experimental

00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:30,259
killed six run time with KD frameworks

00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:32,529
frameworks six so people can easily test

00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:36,200
their applications against this stuff

00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:39,289
and should help them hopefully then we

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,659
went through portal situation we are

00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:44,599
actually missing some of the portals

00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:47,389
some are not an important but one

00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:50,779
actually is and that is printing support

00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:54,139
in cute so we need someone to implement

00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:57,590
it it could be a good ji-suk project but

00:18:54,139 --> 00:19:03,830
it would require like a good student for

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:06,109
that and then if we fixed some

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,509
application because we went through all

00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:10,190
the topics quite quickly so i think

00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:12,710
david fixed Faulconer

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:16,730
on Wayland I've been looking onto fixing

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:18,740
my mime type as a solution with ocular

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:27,190
in flat pack

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:29,600
and I guess that's it thanks young after

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:32,000
lunch in the same room we had the

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:38,149
enterprise gold discussion regarding

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:40,279
Katie in the enterprise sky so we're the

00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:41,899
to help of the first hour we collected

00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,370
some feedback from some of our larger

00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:45,679
deployments like our friends a Munich

00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,240
some Caio fuse discussion because

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,149
network shares are apparently thinking

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,940
companies some various plasma related

00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:54,500
conflict lockdown things like that and

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,020
the second hour we went through the

00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,480
Katie sysadmin configuration wiki which

00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,669
moved wiki's for some reason the idea is

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,830
to make it like a markdown kind of page

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:06,110
like our new hick human interface

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,149
guidelines page and also use more

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,559
automated scripted extraction for

00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:12,200
configures and things of that so they

00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,149
don't go outdated after week and also

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,909
the question how can i deploy our plasma

00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:18,440
in our company we feature X by default

00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:19,970
comes up a lot of mailing lists so

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,779
that's all something we want to improve

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,779
in documentation

00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,940
[Applause]

00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:34,390
and rounding out the day in that

00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,390
particular room was Android by Nikko

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,840
Android sucks but we want to support it

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,540
anyway because part of the all about the

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,840
apps goal is bringing our apps to more

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:50,600
platforms and also we want to have it

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,210
serve as a kind of porting aid toward

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:57,250
plasma mobile and so we talked about

00:20:53,210 --> 00:21:00,200
Android first of all we talked about our

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,000
integration with f-droid which has been

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,720
broken for quite some time now but it

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,720
should be fixed now

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:13,190
next we talked about some improvements

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,830
to our Android build systems to make the

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:19,310
apks a bit more lightweight and fix some

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:22,870
issues and some apps we have then we

00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:24,940
went through the list of our current

00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,710
applications that are ported to Android

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,440
some don't even build on the binary

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,540
Factory at the moment so we looked at

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,280
what's the cause and made some made a

00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:40,550
plan to fix them lovers built but don't

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,640
run fine because of various minor issues

00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:47,060
and we made a plan to fix those and

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:50,870
luckily some apps like itinerary ok trip

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:53,600
work perfectly fine on Android then we

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:56,420
looked at some of the frameworks where

00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:00,290
we need to put more work into making

00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:03,440
them good on Android that sometimes

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:07,460
involves with a larger redesign to

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:11,210
abstract the two separate the

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:14,060
implementation from the API that's

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:17,630
something that's mostly relevant for the

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:21,350
kf6 times and for some other frameworks

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:23,720
we need kind of Android backends so for

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,900
example we want to make Android backends

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:31,370
for accessing the calendar and the

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:34,460
contacts back-end stuff on Android then

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,500
we looked at some apps indicating

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,410
ecosystem that are not yet on Android

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,290
but might be useful and Android for

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:48,860
example plasma phone book came to mind

00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:52,370
or other apps such as cuckoo or maybe

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:54,860
even discover with a flat pack for voova

00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:57,740
back-end for F droid and then we also

00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:00,530
looked at some frameworks that are not

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:09,710
ported to Android yet but my useful but

00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:11,830
only one or two came to mind thanks Nico

00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:16,220
after all these exciting developments

00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:20,900
it's time for a very very boring session

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:25,400
which is panels nyan nyan fabricator

00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:27,800
cleanup yeah it was in tremendously

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,500
boring and so I don't really want to say

00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,710
anything about it other than fabricate

00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:37,210
of what is now in tip-top shape

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:41,780
[Applause]

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,770
progress after lunch the KDE student

00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,560
programs kayo

00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:56,480
and of course all the students who are

00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:59,060
here raise your hands okay so in the KDE

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,300
student programs buff we could discuss

00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:03,500
and make some plans for our

00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,730
participation in the googles programs

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:10,070
and we could also make plans for the

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:12,470
season of KDE so we could discuss how

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,540
the promotion will be done and when it

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,060
will be done and then in the end we

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,040
could have a conversation with the some

00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:25,210
mentors and students that were there

00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:25,210
about how their projects were and yeah

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,320
I mean the students are mostly hiding

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,770
over there but we should all wave to

00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,880
them and say thank you for your work

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,169

00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:57,049
were a very small group but we were

00:24:52,610 --> 00:25:01,100
visited by Tobias and I've already

00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:03,320
