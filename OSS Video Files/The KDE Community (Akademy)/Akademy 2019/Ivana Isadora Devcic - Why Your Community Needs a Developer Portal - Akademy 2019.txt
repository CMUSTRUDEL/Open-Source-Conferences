[Applause]

00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,820
thank you thank you thank you all for

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,660
coming here it's nice to have some

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,509
people in the room at least say I'm here

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,010
to talk to you about the concept of

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:22,260
developer portals and tell you how not

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,060
just this community but every free and

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,400
open-source software community can

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,320
benefit from having one now the problem

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,260
is that I could talk about this for days

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,180
but we only have a very short time here

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,460
so I'm gonna have to fly through it on a

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,440
very basic level but if you would like

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,020
to discuss details with me you can

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,809
always just contact me on Twitter or I'm

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:46,110
in Katy promo channels every day I try

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,200
to be online most of the time so yeah

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,079
you can find me there so so this whole

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,050
talk was actually inspired by developers

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,730
by you by people I work with at this

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,920
company or some labs where I work as a

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,170
technical writer by my friends who are

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,539
developers but I developers I talk to

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,400
you online in different contexts so in

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,229
in these talks with the developers I

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,420
realized that they often feel like

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,820
they're taking for granted especially by

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,340
managers there quite a few managers who

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,860
treat their developers as code monkeys

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,140
and are not really aware of their needs

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,780
and issues and it's true that you

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,310
developers are very smart and

00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,290
self-reliant but sometimes you also need

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,330
help and this type of help that you need

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,750
is very different from the help that our

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,270
end users need and as a community that

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,400
wants to grow and that wants to attract

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,909
new developers it's very important for

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,680
us to accommodate that so luckily in

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,420
recent years even some big software

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,159
companies have started realizing this

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,049
you know that developers actually matter

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,600
and that they need help so you can see

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,149
initiatives like developer relations or

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,670
Daryll for short so that's basically a

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,770
technical community management it kind

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,740
of boils down to building a community

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,479
around a software product and trying to

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,060
give those developers use that product

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,780
as many resources as they need so that

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,640
they can be productive and successful so

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,709
it's a basically a two-way relationship

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,610
between the developers who give feedback

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,980
to the company and the

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,530
who tries to make their product better

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,960
based on that feedback so developer

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,480
experience is analogous to user

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,510
experience because as we know developers

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,540
are also users they just use supper in a

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,700
different way so the things that matter

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,540
to developers are different than those

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,880
matter to the end-users so in different

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,090
studies of developer behavior and

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,650
expectations the results show that

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,959
documentation influences the developer

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,340
experience a lot more than many of you

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,330
may think for example poor navigation

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,790
insufficient or completely lacking

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,230
information no working code samples

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,270
those are all things that make a bad

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,130
developer experience and this is where

00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,530
developer portal step in as a potential

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,720
solution so what is a developer portal

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,550
it's a self-service hub that contains

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,500
all the resources that developers might

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,390
need to understand and work with a

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,370
product you can also extend this

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,620
concepts to include and user

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,660
documentation such as user guides you

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,950
know your regular user manuals and then

00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,620
you can just call it a documentation

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,780
portal but the basic idea is the same

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,360
it's the landing page it's a complete

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,400
information architecture that designed

00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,260
to support your documentation and then

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,140
by extension your product and your whole

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,420
community so when you're building a

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,640
developer portal you're gathering all

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,890
this shared knowledge in one place and

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,840
this is this is important because it

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,940
becomes a place where developers start

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,440
to build their own things based on your

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,630
technology it's also important because

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,000
it's a place where businesses you know

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,459
corporations start to see how they can

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,440
make use of your technology and if we

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:54,310
want Kenny to be successful and work

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,709
with you know big businesses we should

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,900
start building your developer portal

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,959
because it has a major influence on

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,239
people who interact with your with your

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,060
products it's very important to get it

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,150
right so how do we get it right this

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,400
will be some essentials that every

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,709
developer should should have so it's

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,299
search we have a search function

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,220
basically you're telling developers

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:20,859
here's how you can find whatever you

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,479
need you need working code examples

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,880
obviously so that they can start working

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,620
with your software with your technology

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,300
immediately so you're telling the

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,940
here's how you can start building your

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,699
own thing um you also need full

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,229
references if have api's always have a

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,880
full api reference on our developer

00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:41,080
portal so that's like telling them

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,780
here's everything we have and you need

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,960
some kind of human contact information

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,780
uh whether it's a link to a mailing list

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,300
or telegram group or whatever just to

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,090
show them here's how you can find help

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,130
if you get stuck it's also extremely

00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,229
important to have different types of

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,060
documentation to accommodate developers

00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:02,860
on different parts of the developer

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,380
journey so for example there's a saying

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,590
that getting started doc should get you

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,600
from negative ten 200 where negative ten

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,060
is a person who doesn't know anything

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,340
about your code or your product but if

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,750
you have only those guides and you don't

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,320
have anything for people who are for

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,030
example at 8:08 e out of hundred so they

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,210
know a lot of things but there's some

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,979
key missing parts if you don't have

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,930
resources to support them you're losing

00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:34,350
a quite a bit of a chunk of your

00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,350
potential developer community so um

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,380
obviously when you try to build

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,240
something like this you want to know

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,120
what's in it for you so what do you get

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,000
from it so some things that this could

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,370
help with our own boarding for example

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,630
we talked a lot about onboarding in this

00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,340
community and it's obviously very

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,560
important so this could make it easier

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,150
we could have you know instead of

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,919
digging through code and sending people

00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,990
thousands of links you just send them

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,810
one link to this developer portal where

00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,970
they can find everything and my

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,340
documentation is scattered around it

00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,010
causes confusion for people who are new

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,020
obviously so you can always tell them to

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,639
just google it but when you say

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,770
something like this to a person who is

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,800
new to community it doesn't really leave

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:22,180
a nice impression so you know better to

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,520
avoid it it also reduces time to hello

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,229
world which is an actual metric that is

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,330
used to measure efficiency of

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:30,490
documentation so how fast can a person

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,710
start building their own hello world

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,010
application immediately after reading

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,330
your Docs when people read the docs they

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,770
usually do it because they have some

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,120
kind of a problem or they're frustrated

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,979
they're trying to solve it quickly so

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,160
they don't really have time to read

00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:48,440
through very long detailed explanations

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,599
so you know you have to accommodate for

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,550
this they also scan instead of reading

00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:56,150
so the layout of your portal should

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,879
accommodate scanning first right so um

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,250
what else the existence of a developer

00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,099
portal is actually a major trust signal

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,740
in itself and the more information you

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,900
add to it the stronger your trust

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,220
signals are so what this means it means

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,430
that you're sending a message to

00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,319
potential developers that this project

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,430
you know it's growing code is being

00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:21,020
maintained their license is in place all

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,669
developer journey stages are addressed

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,840
whether you're a beginner or someone

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,419
who's already experienced you always

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,849
have a place to start working on

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:30,680
something and you know there's there's

00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,930
enough contact information on the portal

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,940
so they know that there's actually live

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,190
people who are currently working on this

00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,310
it's not a dead project or anything like

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:43,280
this you also target a very different

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:46,569
audiences when you have such such a

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,699
variety of content and it helps also to

00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,020
to optimize for search engines for

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:52,699
example when you have all the

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,919
documentation in one place it's easier

00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,630
to optimize this one page in three

00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:59,599
different pages in three different

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,370
places so you can also target developers

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,250
from other communities or as we said

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:07,669
from businesses who want to integrate

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:12,229
with your with your technology it also

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:15,259
increases visibility among members of

00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,419
other communities and it's it's an

00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:19,610
opportunity to showcase your software

00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,380
projects in a different way than you

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,020
would usually do so you can say we

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,789
usually promotes offer to users as you

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,310
know this is dolfe in our file manager

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:30,279
you could share files here but on the

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,560
developer portal you can give more

00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,149
prominence to some developer related

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,789
features you can tell them how to build

00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:41,050
integrations with different for example

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:45,079
file sharing services or stuff like that

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:46,970
so you can also use this portal as a

00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:49,100
whole to improve the image of your

00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,810
community as one that's very easy to

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,000
work with because you have all these

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,420
resources in one place and there there

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,490
is

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,589
fine because in problem we see people

00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,630
online all the time they're asking how

00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,940
do we start to tributing to Katie where

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,889
do we start so if we have a good answer

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,050
to this it would be a lot easier to

00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:09,740
convince those people to actually join

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:12,110
us so let's look at a few examples of

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,480
developer portals that actually exists

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,850
in other freedom source software

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,680
communities so this is Fedora so as you

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:22,190
can see they have actually some really

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:28,420
nice calls to action immediately on this

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:30,949
page they give you links to tools and

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,649
resources to help you help you start

00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:36,709
developing basically immediately so

00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:39,380
there they're aiming to reduce this time

00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:42,019
to hello world that we mentioned you

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,579
know has a very simple one but again

00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:46,880
also has all the essential information

00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:48,649
on it it has some useful links it has

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,870
the link to the full API reference which

00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:52,820
we said was very important and they also

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,829
have an interesting thing right at the

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,990
top it's not very visible but they let

00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:58,850
you switch contexts quickly so you can

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,310
switch between developer and user

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:04,100
documentation on the same page which can

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,050
be helpful actually and then this is a

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,820
snap craft I'm not sure if you can see

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,399
that snap craft I Oh

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,529
for building snaps right they had this

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,470
really really cool thing that developers

00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:17,630
I've heard appreciate a lot which is

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,579
code samples in a bunch of different

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,070
programming languages so this can be

00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:24,140
extremely helpful and if it applies to

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,690
your technology or to your project it's

00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:30,470
really good to have this so what do we

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:33,740
have in KD so how does it look like when

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,839
someone joins and needs documentation

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,060
well our problem from the way I see it

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,279
is that it's all scattered everywhere

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,260
it's very decentralized it's not a huge

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,110
problem but it's still something that we

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,360
could maybe optimize and do better and a

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,639
developer portal could be a way to solve

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,990
this it's not the only solution but it's

00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,480
it's a good start

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,040
this is how people feel when you tell

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,839
them things like this when you give them

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,269
a bunch of links and then big dinner on

00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,740
where start so how do we fix this well

00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:06,440
we could have an approach that combines

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,889
centralized and decentralized approaches

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,739
to

00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:11,389
so if our documentation is already

00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:13,850
decentralized we don't have to move it

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:15,679
all to one place immediately we can just

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,269
build one landing page that will connect

00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:21,529
them all so in this way we'll kind of

00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:23,749
mask the complexity that we have and we

00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:25,970
will still have this one central place

00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,239
that we can use for search and for

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,189
highlighting different types of

00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:33,739
documentation so yes we have this dog

00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:36,109
socki deed or org which has some

00:11:33,739 --> 00:11:38,359
problems for example search can you find

00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:40,730
a search on this page it's very small

00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:42,919
it's very like up in the corner and it

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,290
should be from the center and also when

00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:47,569
you have to explain the navigation on

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:50,480
the page that means the navigation is

00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:51,980
not really that great is it so yeah this

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,359
is something that we could improve and I

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,029
already know that there are projects

00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:57,859
working on this I think Karl John who

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:00,019
maybe not here not not sure yeah your

00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:03,139
dick so he has plans for improving it so

00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:05,779
that's great we have this also which is

00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,879
kind of better than the previous one

00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:10,730
this is wicked Arcadia org so it has

00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,860
like some semblance of what a developer

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,959
portal could be but it has this weird

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,860
mission statement thing at the top which

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,629
is like weird flex but okay it's yeah so

00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,299
we don't we definitely could work on

00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:24,829
this to make it better so it's yeah it's

00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:28,069
not great not terrible there's always

00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:29,749
room for improvement so how to fix any

00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:31,699
documentation you have any documentation

00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,290
this is how you can fix it which is

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:34,879
basically repeat what I said at the

00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,679
beginning so you need a better surgeon

00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,179
needs better navigation you always need

00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:39,919
code examples when you're writing for

00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:42,860
developers the first thing they want is

00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:45,829
always code examples and yeah definitely

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,919
make it look modern when I say that I

00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:50,749
mean the only pages outdated same way

00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,179
they looked you know in the beginning of

00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:57,049
the 2000s because that kind of sends a

00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:59,449
bad signal it doesn't it makes the site

00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:02,119
look untrustworthy basically because

00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:04,009
it's not immediately obvious to the

00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:06,589
person who is visiting it for the first

00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:09,379
time that it's actually being developed

00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:12,709
developed and maintained so try work on

00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:15,829
that so yeah I think I'm almost out of

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,699
time so if you think that the KDE

00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,549
community needs

00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:20,899
a developer portal here some things that

00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,819
you could do

00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:26,059
or you could start doing so we could

00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:28,369
build a centralized index or a catalog

00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:30,499
or however you want to call it of all

00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:34,730
you need documentation and we can have a

00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:36,740
search that will use whatever back and

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,910
we want to use in in in the background

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,610
you to actually search through

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,259
everything or we can start small you

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,990
could take your own project whichever

00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:46,879
one that is and you know motivate people

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,069
to actually start improving the Docs

00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,129
based on some of the things we mentioned

00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:54,379
before so more code samples different

00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:56,029
types of documentation different types

00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:57,800
of guides right once we're getting

00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:00,230
started once we're doing more if you

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,740
don't have a detailed API reference do

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,779
include it definitely keep working on

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,369
documentation I think now it's kind of

00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:09,439
the right time to do it in this

00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:11,389
community because there's already been

00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:13,550
so much work done on it as you've

00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:17,089
probably heard in previous talks today

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,829
doing the goals discussion good thing

00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,139
about documentation is that it fits into

00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:23,179
every goal because you know better

00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:25,429
documentation is always a good thing to

00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:27,410
have so whichever goal you're working on

00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:29,689
or trying to contribute to documentation

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:32,540
will always fit into it so try to do

00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:35,929
that it's also cool to think about

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:38,029
options such as documentation friends or

00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:40,579
hackathons where people get together and

00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:42,769
instead of coding as you do they would

00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:45,259
actually work just on documentation or

00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:47,449
you could maybe have something like an

00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:49,730
indexing police I couldn't think of a

00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:51,410
better name for this but it would be a

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:55,610
group of contributors who don't even

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:57,889
have to be has to have some special

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,470
technical knowledge they just need to be

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:02,329
able to observe links that are broken or

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,519
things that are not indexed properly and

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:06,019
they would just report a list of things

00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,339
that are not linked or things that are

00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:09,499
missing from recommendation they would

00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,929
report this to you and then you can

00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:13,429
start working on it in more detail and

00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:16,309
if you want to see some really good

00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:18,819
examples of developer portals if you go

00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:22,639
to the portals of the world Ward the org

00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:25,910
that's a site that every year well I

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:29,389
think since last year they nominate and

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:31,009
award a different developer world in

00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:33,559
different categories you could get a lot

00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:34,400
of inspiration from there and yeah

00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,470
definitely

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,010
you're working dogs and if you want to

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,060
talk more about this or reach out to me

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:50,690
thank you for all listening

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:54,800
I don't know if we have time which is

00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:57,050
probably not but yeah maybe raise the

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,900
next speaker so you can set up and maybe

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:10,010
if that's a question you can ask this

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:13,610
while ray connects is computer yeah hi

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,290
Mona thanks for great so there soon it's

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,910
just a suggestion are you attacking this

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,770
effort somewhere maybe start a

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:24,850
fabricator task or something so people

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:27,500
could join in if you think it's worth

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,750
starting an initiative I think we could

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:39,710
do it I think it's definitely worth it

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:42,310
so yeah go for it so one of the four

00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:46,750
basic principles of agile development is

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:50,090
both we value working code over

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:53,090
documentation in other words the best

00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:58,880
code documents itself so what's your

00:16:53,090 --> 00:17:01,580
take on bib in my workplace a lot of

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:05,060
people's lifestyle yeah you advocate

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,770
entirely different approach I'm not

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,130
telling you like Vishal those approaches

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:13,220
like I like based but like how does it

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,920
square is it like entirely orthogonal to

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,200
this like working working proud over

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,300
documentation or can those two

00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,360
principles somehow complement each other

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,920
well I think you need some kind of

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,160
documentation for people who are

00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,080
starting at least so you need to know

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,760
how to start to work with something and

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,300
then you can only start understanding

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,370
the code I think do you expect newcomers

00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,950
to start reading the code immediately

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,410
and not the dogs I'm not sure if I get

00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,780
your question I don't think I don't

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:48,130
think the the thing you mentioned is

00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,130
completely completely at odds

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,919
aha yeah that's true that's true but

00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,260
then again there's a lot who don't so I

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,809
guess it depends on on the industry or

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,240
the approach I personally think that you

00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:07,940
always need some kind of documentation

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,580
at least something basic and then it all

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,500
depends on what you're aiming for you

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,909
don't really need a developer portal if

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,080
you don't want to attract developers

00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:16,700
it's like simple as that

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,640
but if we do want to grow as a community

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:23,539
and there's already so much invested in

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:28,000
this I think this could be a way forward

00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:28,000
