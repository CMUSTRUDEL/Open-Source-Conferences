we run CI for KT neon we run CI for

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,300
netrunner I'd like to call out scarlet

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,350
in particular for being an awesome

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,090
person in maintaining code quality we're

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,490
not actually hiring right now but

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,110
there's lots of projects that happen all

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,550
the time and we'd be happy to hear from

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:05,599
you that's it

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:09,920
[Applause]

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,749
thank you Tiger from canonical thank you

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:20,659
it's actually Igor Igor would be an

00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:22,489
apple product I work for canonical I'm a

00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:26,120
developer advocate and I have a little

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:29,569
story so there are users and there are

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,489
developers but developers are also users

00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:36,379
and there's an old Latin proverb the

00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:39,769
user of my user is my user and we

00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:42,139
actually in canonical want to help all

00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:45,290
of the users so when you create software

00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,980
the actual idea and the creation is only

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,689
the first part

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,849
there's the distribution and maintenance

00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:51,980
and those are the hard bits so basically

00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:54,230
what you're trying to do is just enable

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,730
you to do your work better there's no

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,060
great philosophy behind that it's just

00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,280
simplicity like simple applications

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,900
simple life happiness and you distribute

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,449
it that's what we're trying to do

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,280
katie is an amazing community you have

00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:08,629
loads of great applications and

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,799
creativity and just we want to be part

00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,799
of that thank you

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:22,909

had just had to go back to his hotel but

00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,160
he's more of a CI CD and infrastructure

00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,680
expert so he'll be able to provide more

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,330
intelligent answer than me and we also

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,490

of our core team member he can tell you

00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:30,440
more about what it's like contributing

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:35,350
to get lab as a wider community member

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,350
so thank thanks again thank you right

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,970
I was themed that was about ambition

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,160
okay

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,840
my name is Austin Manito I recently

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,940
joined a company called ambition

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:59,200
ambition is a 100% subsidiary of Daimler

00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:01,540
basing Burling about 200 people a little

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,940
bit over 200 people over 40

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:08,500
nationalities so it's been design it has

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:10,750
a very diverse ecosystem and the reason

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,470
why we are here is because we are taking

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,690
our first steps towards moving from

00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,479
being open-source consumers to

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:26,320
open-source contributors and that is a

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:29,650
journey that I will be as happy when we

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,620
finish that is a that is a very

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:36,279
interesting and hard journey for every

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:41,380
organization and especially for for big

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:44,470
corporations and industrial companies so

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:48,180
in this learning process one of the

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:51,160
things that I am very interested on and

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,370
ambition also is to learn how community

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,540
works that's the main reason for being

00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:02,620
here

00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:06,130
and ykd well first of all we have a few

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:11,080
interesting match we are a C++ cute

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:13,900
house we do infotainment we do shells we

00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,540
do navigation we do multimedia we do

00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:21,670
mobile applications there are tons of

00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:25,000
crossroads and also we we are a great

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:27,640
place for hosting interns working

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,900
students and this is something that

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,940
Daimler and ambition has it by heart so

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,920
the whole idea for us being here is also

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,140
is trying to explore and learn how we

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,330
can create in the near future

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,780
a sustainable

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:46,390
win-win relation so the message is

00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:51,190
basically thank you for for hosting us

00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:53,980
and for and let's see if we keep doing

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:58,260
our homework there will come a time in

00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:04,080
which we will be ready to basically

00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:08,110
contribute thank you thank you this team

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,650
wait wait because you have double

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,650
homework today

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,370
okay so miracle we make it here and

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:21,930
asked me to say a few words about all

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:24,480
yen and you will have the luxury to see

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:27,400
myself for the very first time ever

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,770
giving a talk with glasses which I'm not

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:33,850
sure it's a very good sign

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:36,010
let's see as some of you might not know

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,740
what I am is hope an invention network

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:42,280
is basically an organization that brings

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:45,450
together companies with their patent

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,210
pools and there are non-aggression

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:51,310
agreement so innovators can do open

00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:55,930
source without worrying too much about

00:10:51,310 --> 00:11:00,280
being yeah having people hostile hostile

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:02,800
people's with you to you so it's a

00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:05,650
complementary organization with KDE in
