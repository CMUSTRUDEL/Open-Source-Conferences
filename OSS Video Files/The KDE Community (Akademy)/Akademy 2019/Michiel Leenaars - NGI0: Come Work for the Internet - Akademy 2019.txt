Title: Michiel Leenaars - NGI0: Come Work for the Internet - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	The Next Generation Internet initiative is the first real opportunity to put significant public funding to work to really fix the post-Snowden internet. NGI was bootstrapped in 2016 at the initiative of the European Commission. The ambition of NGI is "to re-imagine and re-engineer the internet for the third millennium and beyond" - and that is actually not exaggerating the importance of the effort. The internet impacts and shapes all of our modern society, and so it needs to be trustworthy and sustainable, both societally, economically and environmentally. And it needs to be robust and resilient, so our society can responsibly rely on it. As a technical community we need to think and invent ahead to actually deliver security, fairness and privacy by design.

During this talk, Michiel Leenaars will present NGI Zero - a unique collaborative grantmaking effort built on decades of not-for profit expertise, with its pedigree tracing back to the introduction of internet in Europe in the eighties of the previous century.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,420
so my name is Miki Lena I work for a

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:10,440
foundation called an L net a Nelnet

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:14,190
dates back to the early 80s when the

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,680
internet was introduced in Europe in

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,119
Amsterdam the first public connection to

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,060
the internet was made and the people

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,189
that did that actually came from the

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,840
UNIX user community they set up a

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,150
foundation underneath the foundation

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,500
they started the company then they sold

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,230
the company again and put all the money

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,120
to in trust fund and basically that's

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,410
still alive which is kind of miraculous

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,480
and our goal is to basically help the

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,610
Internet so the money was given to for

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,100
the benefit of the Internet and one of

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,129
the things that we've been doing in in

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:53,070
in the recent years is to get involved

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:54,600
with public funding for R&D and this is

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,219
a program called the next generation

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,350
Internet and it's been it's been booed

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,210
straps for three years but actually only

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:09,119
last year in November things started and

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:16,740
about four seconds from now we will have

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:19,560
a cool nice reload and it's quite

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,400
actually a serious matter I mean if you

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,920
look at it after Snowden of course

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,990
everybody realized that the internet was

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:34,049
actually a Trojan people knew that it

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,079
was broken and nonetheless rolled it out

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,900
to the world and people have been using

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,750
it in good faith but meanwhile all the

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,939
time people were actually spying on us

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,189
so obviously that meant a huge

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,250
responsibility and yet so little has

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:53,030
changed and that is the sad thing so

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,969
three years ago the European Commission

00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,680
called me and some other folks I said we

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,009
want to do a completely reboot of our

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,960
ideas and then I went to the meeting and

00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,210
in that meeting the word Snowden was

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,590
only mentioned by me there were no

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,370
people from the technical community

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:15,250
there was no ATF leadership

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,950
and somehow we did manage to actually

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,800
get the message across and so that's the

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:26,880
the amazing thing is that we've been let

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,880
me unlock my hard disk while I I thought

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:43,060
magic is it picking up the screen you

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,420
should see a wonderful plasma login

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,420
screen

00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:03,530
it's real make sauce so yeah that's what

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,530
you get for doing that

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:22,250
so and I mean it's not just us that is

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,900
saying that that we're in a shitty

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:32,230
situation actually I don't know if

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:34,430
people know who Tim berners-lee is but

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,300
he had something to do with the web

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:41,239
early on okay

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:49,459
and he said this and this is he said

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:52,489
that's god damn why don't we just unify

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:55,519
out books and then at least we'll well

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:58,700
get to see something basically he's

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,569
called the web emergently anti-human he

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,850
is actually compared it he says it's a

00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,650
dystopia to him by now and this is when

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:12,860
he was given the most prestigious prize

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:17,150
in IT the Turing award and the image to

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,850
illustrate that is these two guys the

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,919
guy on the left is Rihanna from Brown

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,870
German guy responsible for the v1 rocket

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,600
also put the man on the moon 50 years

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:29,390
ago is they actually went to the US was

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,400
forgiven everything that he did the

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,350
other guys covered Oppenheimer and he

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,169
invented the atom bomb that was thrown

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,970
on Japan the food that they were

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:42,110
throwing all in Japan and I don't know

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,640
who made the rubble in the middle but if

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,690
you think about it it really doesn't

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:50,030
matter we're in it we're in a pretty

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:53,180
scary situation and if you look at the

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,490
internet you see why because it's such

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,760
this is a vision an old visualization of

00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:04,789
the internet it's grown more complex

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:06,710
arguably and if even if you want to do

00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:08,180
anything you have to talk to many many

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:10,610
different parties I mean this is just a

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,970
sample of the larger ecosystem that that

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,310
that we got engaged with with this

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,630
project but there's so many parts that

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,479
you need to talk to and that's exactly

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,970
the problem that this ossification is is

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,740
causing you need to talk to everybody to

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,659
make and there's no Big Bang where you

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,310
can replace parts of the instance so

00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,290
pretty much you're stuck with what we

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,490
got

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:35,530
decades ago so going to the moon was a

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,360
big thing I mean the ten thousand people

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,820
for a decade but fixing the internet

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,960
it's actually even bigger arguably

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,700
because it's the biggest thing that

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,130
we've ever created everything is tied to

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,720
it everybody's on it the biggest company

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,400
on the planet are on it and actually

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,160
there are on the other side in some

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,230
cases so it's it's highly political

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,180
because the Chinese and the Russians and

00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,980
Americans and the Europeans tend to not

00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,260
agree on how things should be going and

00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,050
then there's this whole chaos of not

00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:04,360
being able to organize people so there

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:08,440
is no time to lose if we want to fix the

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:11,650
Internet then then a lot needs to happen

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:16,620
so we we did this study together with

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:19,450
Gartner and we wrote actually a vision

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:24,570
for the for this next generation

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:30,030
Internet initiative and it the idea set

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:30,030
for a political goal you can't be too

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,260
technical so you have to give high-level

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,180
goals and so we made three three one

00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,050
high-level goal is saying it has to

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,620
include everybody

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,940
and everybody has to be able to to to to

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,230
benefit from this so if you're not

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,820
working for one of these big tech

00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,980
companies and you want to infant how

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,920
technology works you should be able to

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,600
because well if you're not hired and

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,610
want to fly to Silicon Valley then then

00:06:52,600 --> 00:07:00,700
well you can do stuff the kind of stuff

00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:03,580
that you do at KT and then we have three

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,530
goals first the Internet has to get

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,200
better I mean it's you have these DDoS

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,150
attacks things break and meanwhile we're

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,590
putting this in our heart valves we're

00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,310
putting it in roads we're putting it up

00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:18,700
in the sky and so the internet that we

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,410
want for the next thousand years and

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,080
things are and we're already at fifty

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,960
right if you go back to the earth other

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,700
things move really really fast and we've

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,150
never been in a worse position to change

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,280
anything as we are now so if there's any

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:37,030
chance of intervention that this is the

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,520
moment and we need to make stuff better

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,010
it can't break it can't the the original

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,920
IP protocols allow every computer on the

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,570
planet to see every

00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,180
other computer and send any amount of

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,670
traffic to them we need to change this

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,620
and this is something that we we need to

00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,690
increase we also needed to be more

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,180
transparent and trustworthy because we

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:59,270
know after Snowden that many things are

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:03,260
broken and that there's security models

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:06,370
that are not working so if we want to

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,570
guarantee how for instance I just

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,110
recently just just now there was a

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,730
presentation about government's putting

00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,680
their information on github so every

00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,620
citizen is now going there and every

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,870
there's a US company seeing the the

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,210
movements of every citizen inside the

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:26,600
software that's being hosted there so

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,450
there's a that is track if your Ministry

00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,400
of Defense in Italy is going there would

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,020
you have your soldiers log on to that

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,840
website and be tracked across the

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,140
internet this is the kind of thing that

00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,140
you have to think about when you're

00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,220
moving ahead because there has been

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:48,110
systematic reviews of global global

00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:50,570
trusts and we wanted to be sustainably

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,800
open unfortunately if you have a great

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,330
new business model and you're building

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,180
on top of Facebook and the Facebook

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:59,840
decides to take your your wonderful

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,570
feature or on top of Google search if

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,840
they take your feature and put it in the

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:09,080
main platform you're gone if and and so

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:12,110
it's not sustainably open we need we

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,520
need this technology to be something

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,090
that everybody can change all the time

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,820
every kid in in the slums of of Delhi

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,280
should be able to open up a library

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,530
computer and and and write the next

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:28,310
technology that brings us forward and if

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,770
not where we're not inclusive so an

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,390
effort like this tends to if you look at

00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,580
it from a policy point of view tends to

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,430
be like a big box checking effort so

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:41,330
lots of different things to address and

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:42,980
we made this huge analysis but of course

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,650
this is what happens when you when you

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,750
order your ship to the moon and then you

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,210
make the people that develop the motor

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,070
and the people the devel the in the

00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,470
cabins and the people that develop the

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,810
fuel have separate jars of money and not

00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,420
core

00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:05,250
mate so that's where we we try to to

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:07,500
intervene this ng i0 is a subset of ng i

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,020
and and we try to sort of create the

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:15,029
fabric for this these are the people

00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:16,620
that we that we involved with a lots of

00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:18,420
different organizations you may

00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,600
recognize some of them I won't spell

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,880
them out because we were slightly late

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,130
but what we what we first afore most

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,820
wanted to do is to make sure that people

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,980
that do work on this on a voluntary

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,130
basis that only have a limited amount of

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,980
time that that people are able to to

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,720
work with this so that you don't need in

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,130
many of these funding cycles that the

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,060
Commission European Commission is

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,470
working with you have to hire a

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,750
consultant that's the first thing you

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,190
say is be willing to spend fifteen

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,410
percent of your budget on somebody

00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,940
writing the proposal and then getting

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,839
the money for you and then you're you

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,820
you you get this we want people to apply

00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,910
this as if they would apply to a friend

00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:04,980
in half an hour with with AB half a page

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:06,480
to two pages of application and we use a

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,070
staged approach because we understand

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,050
that people don't have the oversight of

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,760
everything we we tend to see a lot of

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,610
things happening and so if people come

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,770
to us and have an idea that is really

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,450
good but in their proposal they include

00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,570
stuff that somebody else is doing really

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,160
good then it might make sense for us to

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,600
contact them say if you looked at this

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,430
if you consider this could you rewrite

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,930
your proposal maybe you want only to do

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,110
half at the half that you do but would

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:33,800
double the money so we think about it

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:37,740
and we also guide them and support them

00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:41,490
because essentially you're just a person

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,459
with an idea or a person with a task and

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,930
that task doesn't involve a lot of the

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,630
things that people have to deal with in

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,100
the practical internet so for instance

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,230
accessibility I didn't see this

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,089
mentioned in the previous but we make

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,790
sure that every project that we fund is

00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:59,610
certified accessible to blind people we

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,170
think this is a moral imperative this is

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,740
not something that every developer would

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,690
know about but if you have people that

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,470
wake up Monday morning 7:30 let's make

00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,630
things accessible because they have a

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,210
a back catalogue of 12,000 blind people

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:17,380
that they walk among then obviously that

00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:19,270
will be a tremendous knowledge boost to

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,500
any project because they can just come

00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,560
and say well if you do this if you do

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,030
that then then you're done whilst if you

00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,670
would have to read up on everything and

00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,580
the same goes for localization for for

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,680
software licenses for going to standards

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,590
bodies which can be usually complex and

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,090
involve lots of politics if you're just

00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,520
sitting here and think I have a great

00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,530
idea it doesn't mean that you're now the

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,390
next thing you do is get you on your

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,120
plane to Japan and sit in a standards

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:49,510
meeting and win because that's not how

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,710
things go so we have people at the level

00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,960
of the internet Engineering steering

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,820
group we have standards people that

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,570
willing to help some of you may Yoast

00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,160
from Lenovo he now works for a Nelnet

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,660
there's a but but you also have people

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,350
from the internet engineering community

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,850
from the w3c we help people set up a

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,280
responsible disclosure procedure we'll

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,020
help them do documentation we help them

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,240
to mentor even setting up a group

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,240
because many people are just sitting

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,890
behind their computer and have a great

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,440
idea but they don't know how to grow a

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,450
team around this we make things

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,920
deployable so we package everything in

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:31,600
Nick sauce and and we have every bit of

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:34,120
software done receive the security scan

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,130
of both the plan and the end result and

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,180
these these are projects that may be

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:42,370
5000 year 5000 euros of size it could be

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,600
bigger but nonetheless we apply this

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,600
whole chain to everything

00:13:47,529 --> 00:14:02,750
no that's a battery no the gods of os

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:04,260
are not friendly to me today it should

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,350
just be in sleep mode so

00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,350
[Applause]

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:40,800
are we still on no we're actually don't

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:44,820
you boot all over again which doesn't

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,420
make me really happy I don't know why

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,420
that happens

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:10,570
I'll rush to this our rushers

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:14,110
so the basic gist of is is that we have

00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,110
let me summarize

00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:35,269
hopefully it picks up if not the busiest

00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:37,339
of it is we have money for you that's

00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:40,190
that that's the idea we're we're we're

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:42,350
here plainly to recruit recruit so we

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:46,069
have a stack of money we want good

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:49,300
people to work on good projects it's

00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:49,300
really not wanting to

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:05,689
so the the general process is there's

00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,279
two topics that we can fund we have

00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:10,689
something on privacy interesting housing

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,689
technologies and this includes

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:32,870
this is this is the key slide so we have

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,820
two topics every two months you can you

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,680
can you can send something in you can

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,380
ask us for between five and fifty K if

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,510
you want less it's also okay but then if

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,420
you're asking for a thousand euros we we

00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,220
cannot also do a security audit on on on

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,630
projects of that size because just two

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:52,730
too expensive if you need more you can

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:56,690
do a follow-up and there's two topics

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,310
search and discovery and privacy

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,710
interesting honest technologies and I

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,710
will quickly go into both of them

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,280
basically we think that confidentiality

00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:09,080
is the new no it should be the new

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,350
normal something that people don't have

00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:16,400
to like like I think about and it is

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:20,720
it's really complex even even things

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:23,390
like PGP are using a VPN it's just not

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,410
doable for normal users so we should be

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:29,330
able to to do this and these are

00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,710
currently just ideas we have a whole

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,170
list of all these projects on our

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,480
website so you can have a check in to

00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,130
see what their worth is but we we pretty

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,790
much take anything so we go from

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,080
end-user applications to to middleware

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,570
operating system alternative operating

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,950
systems so if you're into sailfish or

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:51,350
Mayer are me go or Nemo or whatever and

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:53,120
you want to build a security application

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,350
one support for developing cert a

00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,110
security application that other

00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:03,710
platforms have we have money for it new

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:06,650
standards and protocols formal

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,990
verifications open hardware projects are

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:13,240
like the nitro key or the be trusted

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:16,040
device and we can even do interesting

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,810
experimental things and these are all

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,950
actual projects that you can find on our

00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:23,270
website and we started I don't know how

00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:28,670
many people were too fast then we

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:30,460
started the first batch in February so

00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,690
the first projects are actually getting

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,990
going to be available surface the

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,780
awesome very spell project where you can

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,610
here

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,500
working on security protocol so you can

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,390
model your your protocol and check

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,670
actually and then generate automated

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,370
code to to make sure that you have yeah

00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,830
you have to pass you have a passive and

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:53,730
an active attacker and see if it checks

00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:55,890
out search and discovery is the other

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,330
thing is basically if we want to do

00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,910
anything as humans that we need to be

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,440
able to just be discoverable and to be

00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:04,320
able to discover people and to be able

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,700
to search people yeah and it's

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,200
everywhere

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:13,590
ethical search is a good example if you

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:17,190
want to make sure that people can find

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:19,410
each other then you also need to know

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,960
how to put red flags on top of them so

00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:25,470
for instance we have people that know

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,260
how to say for website that hosted that

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,540
is compensate against its its carbon

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,460
offset and we can actually flag that in

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,230
the search results we can actually flag

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,550
if that a hundred thousand company is

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,410
going to track you when you click on a

00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,640
certain link before you do because not

00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,290
that's not the imperative of a search

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,460
engine

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,190
unless you own the search engine and

00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,840
that's what the search project is doing

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:49,730
male pile and new appeal are other

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,970
projects that you you may be aware so

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:57,180
the core gist of it is we have today is

00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:59,280
the day to start to create the next

00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,140
version of the internet and we asking

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,060
you to come and join and work for the

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,740
internet that's that's how you see it is

00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,950
you can work from home you can work part

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,190
time

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:10,650
you can bloody well do whatever you feel

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,860
like as long as you help save future

00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,670
generations that's all we care about and

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,960
that's what we're here for

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:21,480
we're searching in Milan Sunday morning

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,150
to see if we can find people among you

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,710
that want to do cool stuff

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:27,120
so claim you're part of history I mean

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,440
the next time we're looking for the next

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,840
