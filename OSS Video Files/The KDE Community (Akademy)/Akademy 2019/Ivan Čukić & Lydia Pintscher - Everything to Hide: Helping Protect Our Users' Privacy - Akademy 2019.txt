	00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,490
hello everybody so I was instructed to

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,809
speed this up as much as I can because

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,910
we are kind of late on the schedule so

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,859
I'm going to skip everything so the

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,630
privacy goal is really well it's going

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:24,150
very well it's not never going to end

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:26,609
because privacy is really hard so my

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,429
current badge says that this is my first

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,630
Academy which is which is really really

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,399
cool especially since I've been a part

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,739
of Kady community for more than ten

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,840
years so it's really nice to be

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,210
first-time with all your cream yeah it's

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,170
a privacy features are nobody nobody

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,110
knows that I've already been here so I'm

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,329
going to head sub I work on Kady stuff

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,340
and I work at one of the Katy friendly

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,340
companies the reason why I'm giving this

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,140
talk is that I'm currently the privacy

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,010
goalkeeper whatever that means I

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:10,020
invented the title it sounds really cool

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:13,920
right so the only takeaway that I want

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,869
you to to remember when you go out of

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,770
this room is the security and privacy

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,259
are difficult so this talk is going to

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,600
be less about the goal itself I'm going

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,130
to cover several things but the main

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,750
thing that I want to stress is that

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,090
security and privacy are very difficult

00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:36,119
now this slide doesn't convey the

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:41,540
importance and the difficult mess of of

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:44,640
privacy so let's say extremely difficult

00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:50,820
so did you all remember these three

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,920
sentences so the privacy goal started

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,200
with the idea that in five years

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,750
Cady's software enables and promotes

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,159
privacy now I'm not really marketing

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,950
guys so I hate sentences like this for

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,200
for several reasons they communicate

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,289
that Kady didn't care about privacy

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,209
before and that after these five years

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,230
we are going to be all of a sudden

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:18,430
private which is obviously

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:21,430
not true so an alternative is to say

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,709
well we want the fee software our filter

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,709
to give us the fifth freedom so the

00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:35,319
freedom to control where to control our

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:38,620
data who we send data to etc so but what

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:41,110
risks do we have as people when our data

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,959
is compromised obviously the most

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,510
popular in the movie is identity theft

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,739
which is always cool at least to watch

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:53,109
other people in that problem obviously

00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:55,349
you wouldn't want something to something

00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:58,720
like that to happen to you

00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:01,950
obviously fraud then government

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,400
fingerprinting be they can follow your

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:08,230
your behavior and recognize you just by

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,230
seeing metadata about your behavior etc

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,810
and obviously blackmail again really

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,730
cool for movies so the next thing that

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,060
is really cool in movies but not in the

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,220
real life is on the professional side so

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,639
you have corporate espionage which

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,980
sounds really nice and intellectual

00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:31,389
property theft because of the espionage

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:34,780
etc so the idea of KDE should not only

00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:38,709
be to protect people's privacy privacy

00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:43,419
but also to give you to do something

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:46,239
even for corporate environments so as

00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:48,250
far as the data that can be used is

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,919
concerned we have metadata small data

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,859
and big data big data not in the sense

00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:57,190
of the buzzword big data obviously so

00:03:53,859 --> 00:04:00,250
what is metadata metadata is let's say

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,250
not not your name not your surname but

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,889
for example the call logs from your from

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,989
your phone so even if somebody doesn't

00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:12,069
know who is the person that you have

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:14,980
been calling or who is going they can

00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:17,620
track the behavior and then then they

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:21,579
can recognize you on the metadata itself

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:26,250
then you have small data like your name

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:27,680
your surname your that you like Kia

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,570
kayaking it's

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,910
stuff so that they can show you

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,009
advertisements and stuff and obviously

00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:37,310
the big data passwords for a bank

00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:38,870
account and anything else and all of

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:45,169
these levels needs to be protected

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:47,630
somehow the main problem in the modern

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:52,070
world obviously I don't want to sound

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:54,680
like antisocial person that we should

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,539
all become Hermits somewhere in

00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,650
mountains or something like that but the

00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:03,099
problem is that today the social aspect

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:07,099
of everything is crucial

00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:09,650
gamification of everything forces you to

00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:13,130
always be online and to share everything

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,919
that you can online I had a friend that

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:18,979
forgot to turn off I think it was

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,729
Twitter's feature that twitter

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:24,680
automatically publishes where she was

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:27,710
just imagine how easy it will be for

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,880
some really problematic person to just

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,750
track the goal so please don't use

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,639
services like that

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,830
if you use services like that at least

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,680
make sure that you're not leaking the

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:44,539
data unconsciously unconsciously so as I

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,500
said the problem with the five year goal

00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:50,720
is that it implies that we haven't had

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,810
the same goal even before it was

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,470
publicly announced so we had Kay runner

00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,990
one of the features that people often me

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,590
you wanted Kay runner to help is like

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:06,650
Ubuntu I want just to start typing and

00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,139
it searches the internet and as soon as

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:14,389
somebody proposed that all the plasma

00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:16,639
team was nope it's if you want to search

00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:20,599
something online then you will you need

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,520
to make an action before that says okay

00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,740
I want to search online you don't want

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,199
anything that you type on your in your

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,960
key runner to be sent to Amazon Google

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:35,210
etc and obviously users hated us for it

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,950
same thing happened to K mail a few

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,099
times in the in the history the most

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,690
recent one the HTML bar on the left-hand

00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,600
side

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:48,490
in essence Camille was always privacy

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:51,610
focused and users sometimes hated it

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:54,670
before it because of it and obviously a

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,810
competitor Coupee and conversation the

00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:02,820
same story unfortunately most of those

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:06,640
are not maintained today but we can skip

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:09,880
then we have the new let's say things

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,820
Inc a deed respect privacy and improve

00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,760
privacy okay it in a very I hope I

00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,910
spelled it correctly which is something

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,920
that vaca is going to talk about I think

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:25,780
tomorrow tomorrow plasma bolts which

00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:29,380
nobody is going to talk about because

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:32,880
I'm going to skip that plasma bolts is

00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:37,030
let's say a secure way to keep your date

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,960
in encrypted containers then we have

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:44,760
plasma mobile is the idea that because

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,410
all of the globalization and etc

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:50,520
currently the applications on your

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:54,190
phones leak a lot of a lot of data to

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,200
everybody and plasma mobile in some

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,330
perfect world would be an alternative

00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,390
ways that you could use instead of

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,270
Android or iOS which will be private by

00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,370
default and obviously projects like KD

00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,240
telemetry which will be privacy

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:14,290
respecting telemetry collection

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:17,370
framework a couple of other things that

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:21,220
are being worked on the integration of

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:24,430
KD applications with store so instead of

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:29,020
just using them normal HTTP connections

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:31,210
or even HTTP we could channel all the

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:35,169
connections through tor for greater

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:38,620
anonymization and one of the best things

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,960
about KD is that vo of a lot of

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,450
applications that people can use instead

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,030
of the let's say online current

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:49,270
counterparts which are not private by

00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,250
default so for example we have one of

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,140
the greatest applications in cave in KD

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,660
was always digicam

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:58,660
you don't need because you don't need

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:03,640
whatever alternatives exist you just

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:06,700
needed eg camp and we had a Maroc we had

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:11,320
a lot of media players instead of going

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:15,910
to YouTube and watching music videos so

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:19,780
this was quite quickly going through

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,940
several privacy ratings now since most

00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:27,580
of the people in the audience I assume

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:31,360
are developers raise your hands ok I

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:35,200
assumed correctly a couple of really

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,120
really small and stupid things that

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:44,230
nobody is concerned about and we should

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:47,380
all be so as I said people users often

00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:49,000
hate us because we value privacy that

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:54,460
doesn't mean that we should stop wearing

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,760
privacy just ignore the users so I want

00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:03,220
to demonstrate to show a couple of

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:05,920
security problems that existed in all

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:10,000
key operations until a few months ago

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:13,440
and in most in 99% of applications in

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,930
the whole world really stupid things so

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,600
Q string is is a class debt obviously

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:23,770
store strings and it's a back-end for

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,980
the password entry widget so whenever

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,620
you type a password in any cute

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,060
application on any or anywhere else it's

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,810
going to be internally stored as a

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:37,570
string that's fine right while you are

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,180
typing it just changes the string that

00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:44,260
that's also fine the problem is how the

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,810
string behaves so when you distract a

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,440
string what happens to the previous

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,480
contents absolutely nothing until

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,000
something else takes the same memory and

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,430
overrides it you still have your

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,800
password in memory so even if you

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,110
destroy all the widgets all the windows

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,930
that you use to enter passwords it's

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:09,320
still in memory the second thing we

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,720
and does the new type of long long

00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,899
password what happens this string

00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,240
reallocates coop is the old data into a

00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:19,820
new buffer so you have the previous

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,310
value again in memory and you have the

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:26,860
new value in a separate part of the

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:31,220
memory and obviously if you use swap as

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:33,740
soon as some some of those ends up on a

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,890
swap you even wrote the password on the

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:41,149
hard drive do you think that that's a

00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:44,390
safe thing to do so the first thing that

00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:47,209
you need to do is if you are distracting

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,690
a cue string that was used for passwords

00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:54,920
you need to zero out the memory before

00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:57,170
you call free or delete and the second

00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,040
thing that you should try somehow to do

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:06,130
is when you resize a string we just

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:10,850
pre-allocate enough memory to to save

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:14,690
any user's password in advance so the

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:17,000
current version of cute zeros out the

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,160
string data on the destruction of line

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,980
edits if line edits are used as

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:26,150
passwords and it pre allocates I think

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:30,320
64 characters for the buffer in order to

00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:32,750
avoid the intermediate copies and

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,570
resizing of the string obviously that's

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,900
not a complete fix because still memory

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:42,140
swapping is a danger etc so my advice

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,620
for everybody here is think about these

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,100
things

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:51,680
don't use wops if you use swap then at

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:55,040
least have an encrypted swap so be

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,680
running on a huge stack we have CPU we

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,800
have operating system we have our own

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,430
program and usually at least in KD will

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,670
love programs that have plugins so we

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:10,220
are running even plugins CPUs have bugs

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:14,300
as we have seen with meltdown specter

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,910
and everything that happened to mostly

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,730
Intel processors recently the operating

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:22,389
systems have bugs security issues

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:25,459
obviously our programs have bugs and

00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:28,660
plugins can have even more bugs and

00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:32,120
plugins can even have can be malicious

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:36,649
obviously if we create our programs to

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,350
run C++ plugins then we are to blame C++

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:41,630
C + + plugin can do anything that it

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,810
that it likes so if you're writing

00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:48,130
plugins based software we choose the C++

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:52,459
then you need to ensure that only

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:55,370
verified plugins can be run if you are

00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:59,269
using something like let's say virtual

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:02,750
machine plugins like qml etc you should

00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:04,370
be safe right because it's a VM qml

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,880
plugins should not be able to do

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:09,130
anything anything bad you do we all

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,639
agree on that

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:15,709
of course not if you provide just a

00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,500
limited set of api's and you ensure that

00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:23,690
only those things can be executed then

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:26,089
we should be fine right nope because

00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,970
cute provides the API is that somebody

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,769
from qml can use and abuse to steal your

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:36,260
data and I'm going to demonstrate

00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:40,819
something and let's hope it works so

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:47,139
this is a password prompt I'll surely

00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:53,029
zoom in so we have a password prompt and

00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:55,190
if I say click me and start typing we're

00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,290
leaking the password into the text text

00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,800
field which is fine it's the same applet

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:03,699
it's obvious that that this applet can

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,399
read its own data that's fine right

00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:11,360
what's not fine is this let's try to

00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:15,829
connect here nope I need something that

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:19,720
will ask me for the password add your

00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:19,720
own probably the same

00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:42,930
nope this one okay so we have a password

00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:57,480
entry and if I say click me let's type

00:15:42,930 --> 00:16:03,060
in for the this is password and it I

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:05,760
broke the code so we have a separate

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:09,330
applet that just printed out in the

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:13,830
password from another applet because as

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:17,340
all the UI widget toolkits to do you

00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,900
have a huge tree and from any node in

00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,270
the tree you can just traverse the whole

00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:25,590
graph and steal the data from everything

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:30,750
else this applies to cute q ml q visits

00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:34,860
q ml HTML gtk any other widget based

00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:38,370
library and nobody kind of thinks about

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:41,760
these things so even if you create an

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,920
API set sometimes the underlying toolkit

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,860
allows you to do much more than what you

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,130
think that that it allows the question

00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,050
is how to fix something like this

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,400
obviously we can't really say tell cute

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,380
people ok

00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,560
from qml you should never be able to

00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:03,800
access a parent and children etc how

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,800
should we fix this ideas welcome

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:18,039
so when you use plugins don't if you

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,779
need to use plugins again don't and if

00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:22,630
you really really need to hear a plugin

00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:25,299
based system at least add some kind of

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,339
verification where you just install

00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:31,210
plugins that are verified by the

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:33,610
developers of that you trust don't

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,399
install a random stuff from even store

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:41,110
KD org don't install random stuff from

00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:49,090
github from malicious software com etc

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:53,769
etc so apart from security and privacy

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:56,019
being really really extremely hard think

00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:59,019
of it like this security and privacy

00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:01,899
needs to come before usability which is

00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:04,840
a strange thing to say but even if users

00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:07,539
complain even if users tell you well I

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,820
know better than the developer who is

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:13,419
developing this application don't trust

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:16,230
the users we are here to protect them

00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:18,399
even if they don't want to be protected

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:22,059
security and privacy before software

00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:23,830
design plugins are beautiful not having

00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,659
to recompile the application just

00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:31,090
restart it with a different set of

00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:32,799
plugins is amazing but don't and I'm

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,870
also to blame for this

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,630
almost all the applications that I

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,730
created for Katy the first thing that I

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:44,049
always did was create a plugin plugin

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:47,649
system and security and privacy before

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:49,960
anything else you need to start thinking

00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:53,470
about these things before you even start

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,980
writing your first line of code security

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:59,950
and privacy cannot be an afterthought

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:03,029
and this is the last slide I think I was

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,029
fast enough

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:18,690
any questions yeah of course

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:30,400
okay my question would be given the

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:32,890
example of the of the password prompt

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,020
from your network applet being snooped

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,060
on by or other applet how much of that

00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,300
could be soft through a multi-process

00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:42,760
architecture so taking a page out of the

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:47,380
book of web browsers these days

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:52,570
okay so multiple processes are obviously

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:54,730
harder just like it's much harder to do

00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,910
something evil in a VM than in a normal

00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:01,270
C++ plug-in it's much harder to do

00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:03,760
something relying on the OS problem than

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,920
on the program problem and etc etcetera

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,730
so each of those levels that have shown

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,800
are in each level is by an order of

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:15,460
magnitude harder to exploit than the

00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:19,180
previous one with multiple processes if

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,610
you don't rely on operating system bus

00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:26,410
or CPU bugs then you cannot do anything

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:29,580
but if you do rely on for example CPU

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:38,740
bug is like meltdown then you can still

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:41,190
absolutely whatever you want any more

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,190
questions

00:20:49,280 --> 00:21:01,910
how can we secure a plug-in based

00:20:52,020 --> 00:21:07,760
architecture disable plugins so

00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:10,770
obviously if you just load GPG signed

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:27,210
plugins that are signed by jonathan or

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:29,010
somebody else yeah right Liz I've got a

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,669
question that's come in on the KDE

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:36,179
Facebook page and it says I'm loving KDE

00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:38,100
neon and I'm loving my ability to store

00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,409
passwords but I've forgotten my password

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:45,270
to the plasma vault I created how can I

00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:48,690
find the data in it yep

00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:50,789
obviously he just needs to send me an

00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,909
email and I'll tell him the back door is

00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:56,370
usually KD dot the date when the vault

00:21:53,909 --> 00:22:01,110
was created dot really really secret

00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:03,510
password for the backdoor dot so for

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:07,320
volts if you forget the password the

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,510
earth code as far as I can understand

00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,250
most of those privacy issues you

00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,049
highlighting they're basically post

00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,360
being pwned like you're already

00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:17,130
installed a Trojan should we even care

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,870
about what happens after you're already

00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,900
installed malicious half grand you got

00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:24,570
hacked yeah because I would I would say

00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:29,700
that's beyond our scope and his people

00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:33,650
didn't get hacked somebody already

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:36,390
installed a Trojan then well who cares

00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,159
yeah but most of your example requires

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,559
already installing a Trojan like like

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,900
installing a malicious plug plugin is a

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:49,080
Trojan I mean otherwise I do agree but

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:53,040
we don't we cater to users that are not

00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:56,039
tech savvy and users that are not tech

00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,950
savvy kind of often do

00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,419
things that are not advised to but that

00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,369
that can also be protected by the

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,979
operating system like like they do on

00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:07,169
Windows and they might do on future

00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:09,330
Linux distributions where you can't

00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:11,909
really install application that easily

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,970
without them being signed yeah of course

00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:17,940
but then we would need to have a central

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,519
authority that signs the packages etc

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:24,989
the thing that I just wanted to add is

00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:28,979
that maybe we all have Trojans in our

00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:31,649
CPUs because there are some let's say bi

00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:35,580
not binary blobs but hardware blobs in

00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:37,220
CPUs both Intel and AMD which really

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,879
have no idea what they are doing

00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:45,599
like the IME and PSP for made me so we

00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:48,869
should try to protect users even from

00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:52,789
those things in essence we cannot ever

00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:56,279
give up complete protection but we can

00:23:52,789 --> 00:24:03,029
put some let's say safeguards to protect

00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:11,629
in most common use cases because privacy

00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:11,629
is never complete ok so thank you

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:36,960
there is just one question well maybe as

00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:39,330
far as I've heard the question is am I

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,019
suggesting to put down the store that KD

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,320
dot-org

00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:45,659
I'm not but we should have some people

00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,860
that are white listing the things inside

00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:51,899
of the store for for wallpapers and

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,740
stuff it should be fairly safe unless

00:24:51,899 --> 00:25:00,480
somebody exploits parsing of Tata desta

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:09,210
files etc but for for more serious

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:11,070
things I would have a why twister don't

00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:14,999
trust anything don't don't trust

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:18,299
anything least of all Ivan no so the

00:25:14,999 --> 00:25:20,340
store situation is such that given that

00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,340
all of the software for that is now

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,690
hosted by kte

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,869
anyone who would like to help with it

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:31,220
please get in touch because that's the

00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:31,220
