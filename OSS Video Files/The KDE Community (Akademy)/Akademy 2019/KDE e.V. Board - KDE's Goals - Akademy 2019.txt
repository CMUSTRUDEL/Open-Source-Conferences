	00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,270
all right we will spend some more time

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,670
talking about the previous goals and

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:14,460
then towards the end of this panel we

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:16,980
will reveal the new ones so one of the

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,100
things that was really surprising to me

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,789
when it started was that two of our

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,550
three goals were suggested by very new

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:30,449
people people who hadn't done a lot of

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:34,320
things in our community before but who

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,020
brought so much energy and drive and new

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,079
ideas into this do we maybe want to talk

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,300
a bit about that how about you new

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:49,469
features do you want to start as one of

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:51,390
those people so yeah for me as I

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,239
mentioned last year it was an amazing

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,670
experience like coming to Katie I was

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,649
around I think like two to three months

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,600
maybe six I don't know but it was very

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,530
early for me I joined via the promo team

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,080
and first of all being able to feel that

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,750
it's like it's okay for me to suggest

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,640
the gold to the community was a major

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,500
factor for me getting more involved I

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,960
feel I felt welcomed I felt like the

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,080
people were willing to listen what I had

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,840
to say yes a newcomer and I urge you

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,000
guys if you're newcomers here to do the

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,520
same don't be afraid to speak out about

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,040
what do you think and for me it's been

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,439
an amazing experience it helped me learn

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,909
a lot and hopefully do a lot for Katie

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,939
through the girls initiative

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,070
so yeah I think that's an amazing part

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,960
of this community that newcomers can

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:48,840
have an impact and have an impact very

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:51,560
early on I also think that it sometimes

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,470
helps to have an outside perspective and

00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,840
the goals I think is a pathway for

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,360
outside perspectives to be invited into

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,689
the Katie community and and bring that

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,219
to us and for existing contributors to

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,280
rally around an outside perspective

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,610
sometimes if you are external you have a

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,280
better overview on on what can be wrong

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,010
with the whole organization or Ness

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,520
wrong but just in potential of

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,170
improvement right because sometimes we

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,720
are in the thick of it that we get used

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,640
to our ways of doing things and then we

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,900
don't innovate and iterate them any

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,180
further but if somebody new comes in who

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,790
can see this is inefficient this should

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,370
be done differently than the goals offer

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,760
them a way to immediately get sort of

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:44,120
cloud and the team behind them and

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,600
improve those ways I always think that

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,010
one of the most beautiful things about

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,610
the KDE community and one of our

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:55,370
greatest successes is that KT is so

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,440
multi-generational where not only do we

00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,450
get successive new generations of

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,100
contributors involved we also tend to

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,750
retain the old ones and have them work

00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,810
side-by-side as I think you have photo

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,580
captured like really beautifully and

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,890
we've always done that really well with

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:13,580
technical maintain ership where for

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,380
example I got into KDE around 2005 the

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,230
initial sort of projects I made my name

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,150
with we're not projects I myself started

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,670
I took them over from previous people

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,070
and to me it was really great that was

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,440
possible like the old generation of

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:30,019
developer was not so entrenched that a

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,660
new one couldn't take over rather on the

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:36,980
contrary they encouraged and supported

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,290
that and now I think the goals allow us

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,090
to do that not just on the technical

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,980
level but also in sort of meta level

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,540
about improving the organization

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,760
improving the community so I think

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:52,510
that's been really great I agree with

00:03:49,760 --> 00:04:10,239
both both of them

00:03:52,510 --> 00:04:14,739
alright alright so looking back from

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:19,959
today to before the gold started what

00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:21,310
would you have liked to know to make

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,770
your life easier what would you have

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:34,380
done maybe differently to make your life

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:37,150
easier I think do you want to go first

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,940
well at least for me coming as a

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,310
newcomer I had no idea how complex the

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,280
KT community was and it's projects it's

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,050
like huge I I still don't know all of

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,550
the people I sit on own many of the

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,919
projects I still don't know what the

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,150
things we are working on her so I'm

00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,460
still trying to figure out my head

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,530
around that so it would be good to have

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,660
I don't know how could that be improved

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,849
the mentoring of people actually helped

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,440
a lot like media I can a Legionnaire

00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,849
people who are very close to me and

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,830
helped me and supported me through this

00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:10,300
process so um what-what I wish I knew at

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,949
least then what I will have done

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,139
differently is probably try and

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:16,720
hopefully you can do better this this

00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:18,820
time with a new round of goals is to not

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,500
be alone in terms of courting anything

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,349
the whole process and push it for that I

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,539
think having teams formed around the

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:27,280
goals and having more people involved on

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,770
a higher level and trying to push for

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,770
them will be we do wonders to our goals

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,229
because you can't get busy it can get

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,470
frustrating it can get like lonely so

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:43,150
having teams working on that would be

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:45,250
big improvement I think I think so my

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,169
perspective is a little bit external

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,050
because you know I participated in a Goa

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:54,039
but I'm not made but I had the feeling

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,770
that all of the goals had their first

00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,530
sprint relatively late after the

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,150
election I want to ask you do you think

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,270
it would have helped you go

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,810
if the Sprint had been sooner in that

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,280
process

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,440
- so colonized

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,790
more early on would that have helped do

00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:15,820
you think it probably would at the same

00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:17,889
time to me it gave me some time to try

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,900
to think of what has been done and what

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:23,440
hasn't and what where we need to put

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,490
much more effort in because so it as I

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,410
mentioned earlier there were only a

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,650
couple of major tests that we didn't

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,389
manage to close in this 2-3 years but

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,880
yeah maybe on the other hand it will

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,290
really help to have them sprint called

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,260
yeah they're here maybe have a second

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,660
screen later based on that in order to

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,220
help with the whole team building as I

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:50,800
mentioned so yeah that's a good idea

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:53,140
going forward I think so sorry one thing

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,490
that just lasted through my mind that

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,470
you couldn't have known at a time

00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,229
because it's happened after the election

00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,660
is that in the last year our income

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,880
situation as you'll hear later in the

00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,330
Financial Group Report improved a lot

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:10,540
our annual income quadrupled essentially

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,430
and we made the decision to give the

00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,919
gold budget to work with

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:18,400
which wasn't two at a time they got

00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:21,190
elected so yeah I think the next set of

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,990
goals can start from that safe

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,229
assumption that they have money to work

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,120
with

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:29,020
that they can put to good use towards

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,050
the goal so yeah so considering that

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,080
goals are like normal KT projects I do

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:38,260
agree that we need to have much more

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,260
Sprint's than than we used to in essence

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:45,430
for the prior sprint which was amazing

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:49,479
but it was quite late in the goal game

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:52,030
and people who appeared we didn't really

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,220
have a focused goal but we were going to

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,780
do on the private sprint everybody

00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,930
worked on their own privacy project

00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:03,010
related projects some even invented

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:06,850
their project privacy related if he had

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:10,360
an early sprint that we could let's say

00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:12,520
agree on some specific focus points then

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,180
all the later Sprint's would be much

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,610
more

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,400
I wouldn't say productive the sprint was

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,479
productive but it would be more tangible

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,090
to say okay

00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:26,770
we did this for the goal and not because

00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:32,699
our project needed it mm-hmm those are

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:35,289
all very good points one one last

00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:37,539
question from me and then we can go to

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:40,409
some audience questions was all of you

00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:43,449
alluded in your talks to still work

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:46,000
being left to be done

00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:48,310
what's the one thing that's most

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,110
important to do for for each of the

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,970
goals well for me I think they think

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,170
that these models work and it's very

00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,449
important is the setting up of a

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,100
development environment story I mean I

00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:02,440
think we can do much better in terms of

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,120
making it much easier to people we have

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,579
the solutions we need to work on them

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,529
and make that possible so hopefully we

00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,930
can continue with that maybe with

00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:13,120
another sprinter in the future work on

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,040
that and try to have some solution I

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,500
would I would say that for the start and

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:25,060
of course a website is a major tool for

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:27,370
me well I think the biggest challenge is

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,550
to keep the momentum up and keep going

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,380
as I mentioned on one of the slides some

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,420
of those user pain points are still not

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:38,230
fully relieved there's still work in

00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:42,430
progress there that will continue I

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,199
think Nate not being here will take the

00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:49,449
opportunity to say that we need to help

00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:51,160
Nate scale he has been fantastic at you

00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:52,949
know leading his goal that he submitted

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,120
and and looking after it and

00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:57,819
communicating its progress to the world

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,690
now I think that's a huge overhead on

00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:04,990
his shoulders and I think we should take

00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,850
the opportunity now to see why has the

00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,610
goal worked so well and formalize some

00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,170
of those processes and and make sure

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,380
they're not just on his shoulders for

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,480
example maybe we should we select the KD

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,310
comet I dressed so that Nate doesn't

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,959
have to blog all the things by himself

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,959
and it could be one way to go

00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:30,380
so for the private sigil the main thing

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,240
that would be for all of you to spread

00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,170
the word that privacy and security are

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,590
extremely hard from the simplest things

00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,970
to the really really complex stuff one

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,780
of the things that I just wanted to

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:49,520
mention we obviously are trying to do

00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:51,800
our best always but you should ask

00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,500
ourselves who is implemented the

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,940
cryptography who has implemented there

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,400
is different things in the projects that

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,680
you're using I've seen several projects

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,730
I'm not going to mention any names where

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:10,640
I'm I'm not I'm a layman in cryptography

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:13,580
and I've seen problems so all the

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,210
developers should I know what they're

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,100
doing and if you're doing something as

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:23,560
important as cryptography and privacy

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,560
are you need to learn a lot of stuff

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:31,690
thank you alright let's go to some

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,690
audience questions do you have questions

00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:47,620
no questions so there's one question I

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,980
have in regards to organization I think

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:54,519
I was from the beginning always a point

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:57,220
person for every goal right so I don't

00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,499
know in privacy I think the point person

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,370
changed at one point or something like

00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:06,759
that for the new goals is it clear that

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:09,490
if the point person is not available how

00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:12,459
the process will be I think for it

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,949
wasn't such a smooth transition in the

00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:18,579
privacy goal for some time it wasn't

00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:21,339
continuing until YouTube over so do we

00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:25,360
know how we would in the future we would

00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:27,610
act in such as such as situation I at

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,470
least don't have the perfect plan yet

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,920
but it's definitely something we need to

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:35,350
figure out there's a bluff I scheduled I

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,930
think for Monday but I think this should

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:43,809
be one of the things we talked about in

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,540
essence as I said the the goals should

00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:48,490
be normal KD projects in normal KD

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,930
projects when the maintainer disappears

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,509
nothing happens

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,939
somebody takes over the problem with

00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:56,800
goals is that we are not we don't

00:12:54,939 --> 00:13:00,160
consider them to be a normal project

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,470
where dead thing can happen in essence I

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,410
hate the fact that there is a point to

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:08,889
person it should be a mailing list it's

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:12,220
a normal project if I don't know if

00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:16,389
Peter Peterson is not present somebody

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:20,459
else should reply so a goal should not

00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,459
be dependent on a single person ever

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,700
not technically a question but just on

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,620
boarding stuff no that goes that made my

00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,420
life as a developer lot easier so now

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,769
when you have some random new person RC

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,910
or something they have a question they

00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:40,740
want to get involved there's now

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,180
something you can point them to like go

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,709
on this wiki page it has all the

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,959
information you need you know it's a

00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:48,089
little story about new contributors

00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:51,120
getting them involved is very important

00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:53,610
so like at some point you get like we

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,000
call it jump it heap splint like it stop

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,890
seeing issues or you get so used to that

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,540
one thing being broken that you kind of

00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,120
voided and then there's this new person

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,470
so they said it couldn't be done and he

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,329
didn't know it so he did it and it

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,800
worked so that's very important to like

00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:10,440
keep the spirit in and get new people

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,420
involved it's just two things you knew

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,860
would be could be done this way but it

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,480
didn't because you know it's probably an

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,550
idea but then it turns out it is and

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:26,699
then you figure out it's amazing so very

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:28,829
important to get new people in hi I

00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:31,230
think one of the most important things

00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:33,269
regarding you know onboarding and stuff

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,430
is that when you join a project and you

00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:37,290
think how can I contribute and you know

00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,540
most people here will contribute by

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,519
writing code but if you contribute by

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,290
you know trying to bring more people in

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,540
it has a multiplier effect instead of an

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,339
additive effect and you know say for

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,930
example you're a busy maintainer of a

00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,149
project you know you do only in your

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,589
spare time and you're thinking I want to

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:54,779
do this and this and this so I want

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:56,220
these bugs to be fixed you know one of

00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,410
the ways that you can actually get that

00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,610
done is to get other people to do and

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,860
how can you do it and obviously we've

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,779
all touched upon it you know

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,980
documentation pointing to people how to

00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,930
build your project how to run your

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,399
project and stuff like that is really

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,839
important and I think that's one of the

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,459
main benefits of the goals that we've

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,459
seen over the past couple of years

00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:22,470
I don't like being well I don't like

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:25,440
being a pessimist but so your idea is

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:29,250
amazing the problem is that a lot of us

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,920
are good at writing code and bad at

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:35,550
everything related to communicating with

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,820
other people so well I completely agree

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:42,150
the best way to do something is by

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:48,330
giving it to others sometimes you don't

00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:51,090
know how I think it's I think one of the

00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,860
reasons it's so hard for us it's not

00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,670
actually because we're all that better

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,770
at communicating

00:15:53,670 --> 00:16:00,330
I think people in our community or

00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,370
engineers in general have a hard time

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,800
quantifying their productivity in other

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,540
ways than writing code if you're doing

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,480
code review if you are helping somebody

00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,060
out you don't feel as productive as if

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,480
you just fix ten bucks and I think we

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,830
can build a social etiquette around

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,210
realizing that if you are doing those

00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,430
kinds of things you are also being

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,680
productive and and robot that because I

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,330
do agree with you that one of the most

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,550
important functions of a project

00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:29,670
maintainer is to enable the work of

00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:32,190
others not just to be the lead coder or

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,530
just to say no to things I'd rather make

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,990
it easier for other people to write code

00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,130
in your project that's an important part

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,050
of being a maintainer and we should

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,090
recognize that and also celebrate that

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,340
one of the ways we do that is at this

00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:46,020
conference with the Academy Awards you

00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:51,270
know I think we should just have more of

00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:53,850
that so to that I have an open offer to

00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:57,660
all developers if you have notes if you

00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:01,410
have a fabricator spring anything that

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,780
you think could possibly make a good

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,490
blog post send it to me I'll make it

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,440
into a blog post you can publish it

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,810
under your name don't even have to

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,050
mention me I mean we just need more

00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:16,290
great blog posts that invite more people

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:18,800
in have you just invented blogs as a

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,800
service

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:29,059
valeria KDE org and it really is open to

00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:49,700
any developer a Google Doc is even

00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:52,190
easier but alright do you have more

00:17:49,700 --> 00:18:03,410
things you would like to talk about from

00:17:52,190 --> 00:18:07,880
your site all right aha shall we shall

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:15,679
we move on to the revelatory moment go

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:20,720
for it all right so as you know new

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:27,380
goals had been proposed and voted on and

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:33,730
are now selected and the three new goals

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:37,480
that we have are consistency Weiland and

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,480
all about the apps

00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,710
[Music]

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:51,020
to go but more into those so consistency

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:55,850
this was about making our applications

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:59,870
settings websites everything our users

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:02,480
see more consistent and more harmonious

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:06,170
and you can kind of see it as a

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:14,720
continuation of Nate's work and everyone

00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:17,540
around him then the Wayland go is an

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,500
enabler for a lot of things to come

00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:25,880
right some of the other candidates for

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:28,010
example will need us to support Wayland

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,330
before we can really make good progress

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:35,330
on them like the touchscreen support the

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:40,280
input methods one and also moving

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:42,530
towards more hybrid devices and things

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,270
like that so it's it's really an enabler

00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:47,600
and keeping up with the technology that

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:51,800
is ahead of us and then last but not

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:55,760
least we had the all about the ABS which

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:59,770
is really over the past year we've spent

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,750
a lot of focus and we should on

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:07,190
promoting plasma and everything around

00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:11,150
it but we also have a lot of rock stars

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:14,929
in our apps and making them more visible

00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:18,620
much more easier to get much more easier

00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:20,150
to install on Linux on Windows on Mac

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,679
and so on

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:28,460
it's something we should spend time on

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:31,250
according to our community yeah so let's

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,030
get more consistent shiny apps into the

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,030
hands of our users

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:44,049
[Applause]

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,960
are the people who proposed those goals

00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:51,669
in the room yeah

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:57,460
Jonathan yes how about you come here and

00:20:51,669 --> 00:21:00,119
say a few words about your girls this is

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,119
your moment to shine

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:21,309
hopefully it's like multi-year moment to

00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:22,929
shine well thank you for selecting all

00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:25,299
about the apps as one of the goals for

00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:27,609
the next couple of years I'm off you're

00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:29,950
scared I have no idea how to do this we

00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:33,009
have we have many fabulous applications

00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,389
you have many interesting but and where

00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:37,359
the applications like stuff like games

00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:40,929
that don't world class but they're still

00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:42,429
great and they deserve to be promoted

00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:44,259
until recently we didn't even have a

00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:47,109
website that listed all of our apps with

00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:51,210
an up-to-date list of applications they

00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:53,529
deserve to be easy for users to get and

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:56,590
we've been pretty slow in embracing

00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:58,570
modern methods for distributing our

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,659
software for people to be able to get it

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,600
directly and that means new

00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:07,059
responsibilities right that means new

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,799
integration between application

00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,690
developers and and finishing that last

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,570
step of getting out and but also making

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,940
sure that it's maintain secure reliable

00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,080
and deprecated that it when it becomes

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,669
on maintained we have a way to make

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,379
market unmaintained that we don't have

00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:22,840
that at the moment it opens new

00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:24,820
possibilities like new business models

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,200
creature has been able to hire

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,369
developers because they've embraced

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,289
modern ways of people getting software

00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:34,090
but pretty much nothing else has done

00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:37,299
that and I think that's a real missed

00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:40,029
opportunity but I have no idea how to

00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:41,889
organize this it I mean hopefully we can

00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:43,960
have a buff and makeup start and

00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:45,700
discussing it I think it because there's

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,749
a lot of lot of work to be done and a

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,989
lot of potential that we can that we can

00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:51,989
grow on

00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:08,309
so I'm very new to the kiddie community

00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:08,309
this is my first time and alright so I

00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,129
will surely need somehow to organize and

00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:21,909
I if you have any suggestion anything

00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:26,099
just write it and it really should be a

00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:29,080
community work and from what to see is

00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:31,419
for my point of view I think that the

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,389
important things is that there are four

00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:36,789
the consisting seagull small goals and

00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:39,849
bigger goals inside it where the small

00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:43,479
goals are small like changing patterns

00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:47,710
alignments or small visual adjustments

00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:50,289
that are that should be found in the

00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:53,320
first place so finding inconsistencies

00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:56,019
should be one the the first thing that

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,599
the people should do and you don't even

00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:00,519
need much technical knowledge to do that

00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:03,190
so everybody should be able to do it and

00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:05,590
then there are fixing the small goes and

00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:09,999
then the consisting also so was about

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:12,580
bigger goals such as using a single

00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:15,609
panels instead of having both panels and

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,830
latter dock that is an example example

00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:20,499
but to be consistent from that point of

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:24,399
view which is obviously way more bigger

00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:28,529
goals so it should rely on very experts

00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:28,529
and a lot of organization

00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:36,279
[Applause]

00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:53,330
I'm Nicola veneer and ey0

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:55,240
I'm Jonathon riddle well once again I'll

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:59,690
be substituting for somebody else and

00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:03,140
reap all the glory now so the circle was

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:05,390
Weyland Weyland is next-gen tech we used

00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,860
to handle input and output putting

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,010
things on screen getting input from

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:12,860
input devices we've been working towards

00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,780
adopting Weyland in plasma and nkd

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,600
software and a stream and cute for that

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,220
matter for several years at this point

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,460
we've made good progress we have

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,530
adventurous users using it we need a big

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,900
final push to get it over the finish

00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,490
line and make it the best way to use KD

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,800
software

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,690
I think this goal is a really neat

00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,780
choice because it's a good example of a

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:38,290
complementary goal if we adopt Weyland

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,960
if we make it production ready it will

00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,820
bring improvements to privacy Weyland

00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,270
has a much better security concept and

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:49,010
the predecessor technologies it will

00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,870
also help relieve some of the pain

00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:53,810
points I mentioned in the earlier talk

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,090
about usability and productivity Weyland

00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:59,960
allows us to do multi-screen even better

00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:02,090
for example so in many ways it is also a

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,560
continuation of previous code just with

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,860
a little bit of a different focus that

00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,020
is sorely needed to get this done so I'm

00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,640
very happy that it could Showzen I look

00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,670
forward to participating in it and

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:19,240
helping drive it forward over the next

00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:19,240
year's all right thank you so much

00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:27,529
and yes if you want to talk about these

00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,080
goals about the goals processes and so

00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:38,690
on please come to the buff I think I

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:41,269
schedule it for Monday Quinn and wailing

00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:45,370
pops all through Wednesday morning there

00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:53,790
you go all right thank you so much

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:53,790
