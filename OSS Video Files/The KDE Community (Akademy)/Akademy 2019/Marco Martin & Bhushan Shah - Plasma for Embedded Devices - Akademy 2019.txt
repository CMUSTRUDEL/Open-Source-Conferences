Title: Marco Martin & Bhushan Shah - Plasma for Embedded Devices - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	Plasma is not only Desktop, as shown by our effort in Plasma Mobile project, but we can go even further than that.

The talk will make the case that Plasma and other KDE technologies are ready for embedded development on single-purpose ARM devices, analyzing real world use cases, both from an UI and hardware adaptation standpoints.
The talk will analyse Plasma Mobile and a voice assistant device, built with Mycroft and Plasma Shell as its sole UI.

Deploying Plasma on such devices have multiple challenges, Bhushan Will talk about them and solutions offered by KDE community. Marco will talk about how is possible to have a completely different plasma based user interface which even tough sharing the same runtime of Plasma Desktop, doesn't retain any Desktop-specific user interface.

okay so hello everybody welcome and and

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:16,560
we are talking about bringing plasma to

00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:22,199
some something different some other

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:26,490
stuff if you if you are here it means

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,609
that you are either working on

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:34,380
developing or using or even just

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:39,090
interested too much of the work that

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:43,500
Kady does as a community a big part of

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:49,140
this work even though not all of it by

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:51,860
an extent is all the software that we

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,469
write on top of the cute library

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:58,020
starting from those very useful

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,829
extensions which are the KD frameworks

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:06,920
to all the applications that we write on

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:09,810
top of them right to having a whole

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,420
desktop offering in the form of of

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:17,610
plasma desktop and even having a

00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:22,400
reference packaging of all of its in the

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:26,570
form of kdeeny on of course there is

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,189
much much more than that a lot of

00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,470
documentation work graphical work and

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,619
website work which is also very

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:45,149
important for us but let's get back in

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:48,920
the topic we we offer full desktop

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:54,020
experience over the last 20 years which

00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:57,750
have been have become really really good

00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:04,259
one of the best out there but I would

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:08,729
say but I'm biased so what I can say but

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,700
yet it's still mostly that a desktop

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,080
offering even even

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:17,510
we are now starting to dabble on mobile

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,030
application development which is which

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:25,519
is which is very good and very important

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:29,959
because right now desktop software is

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:32,170
just it's just a small part of of the

00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,830
computing that that people do with a

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:38,810
vast array of devices mainly mouse and

00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,150
keyboard is an assumption that it

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:47,060
stunned are starting to become not

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:49,310
completely true even for for for laptops

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:53,959
that that people are buying which which

00:02:49,310 --> 00:03:00,049
can be transformable or can be can have

00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:03,260
some weird way of user input that we

00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:08,540
were still not expecting a big a big

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:11,560
challenge of adapting is also comes from

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,989
from our vendors also comes from

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:21,049
actually making free software work at

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:23,840
all on some of some we're larger so I

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:28,150
will I will pass the voice to our

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,150
resident Hardware God Bhushan

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:36,650
[Applause]

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,480
right so so as Mark you mentioned the

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,139
computing is no longer the test of

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,139
devices or laptop devices computing is

00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:48,590
not computing has evolved into this

00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:52,190
whole new set of devices like smart

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:55,099
watch smart speakers or or even the car

00:03:52,190 --> 00:04:00,019
in from information entertainment system

00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:03,470
which you can use to watch listen to

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:07,609
music or navigate or basically read your

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:10,370
image so the question is are we as a

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:14,720
plasma or are we as a PD community are

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:18,289
we ready for this entirely new subset of

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,930
devices or do we want to reach out to

00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:23,890
this user or do you want to make use of

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:27,100
our KD software on this to

00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:31,270
so question so the answer to this

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:35,650
question is largely we are ready for it

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:37,060
but not there yet so to explain my

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,910
answer

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,730
well this devices every devices have

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:46,740
their own user interaction method user

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:49,180
interaction method for example some some

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:54,100
devices will have a touchscreen some

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:58,000
devices will be just they will be just

00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,460
as basic monitor basically display fare

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,080
and you can you will be interacting with

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:07,300
voice or other other commands or remote

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,090
devices for example in case of smart

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:14,380
television

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:18,340
also this devices will have a different

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:22,720
range of hardware or actual computer

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:27,850
inside it so it means well every device

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:30,850
is totally different and to make plasma

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,670
or well as Marcus mentioned to make free

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,880
software work on these devices there are

00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:40,270
several challenges like find a lock this

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:44,430
devices might be vendor locked in this

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:47,440
device will have no way of installing

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:51,250
custom software on it apart from what is

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,200
provided by bank there are still systems

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,070
out there in market which she have

00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:00,250
running and of lives and of life's

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:04,690
system software like kernel and people

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:07,660
are still buying it so that at Iowa's

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:11,380
know 2 or 3 devices which are running 3

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:15,160
point at 3 point 10 or 3.18 kernels

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:19,120
yeah and also each devices have their

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,010
own set of bugs or problems which I

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,260
generally tell you it's like there is

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,010
graphics drivers are not working display

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:29,080
subsystems is not working or even like

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,690
you will have some kind of overheating

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,630
problem or thermal issues or performance

00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,889
issues so each device is totally

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,889
complicated so

00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:42,009
I on the desktop generally it's the case

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:45,069
of everything works and we have a small

00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:47,949
subset of box but here it's a totally

00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:52,629
different we we have we have problems

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:54,639
right from the start and also solving

00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:56,349
this problem is not easy because most of

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,270
this hardware is closed down vendors

00:06:56,349 --> 00:07:02,039
doesn't provide any kind of hardware

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:05,379
design or schematics or information to

00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:10,810
properly run the free software on this

00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:12,039
devices that leaving aside problems I am

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,840
going to talk about some of the

00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:15,279
solutions we iniquity community are

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,090
working on

00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:21,460
so one thing we are working on is PD

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:25,509
frameworks kiddie frameworks is a set of

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:29,500
extensions so QT is already quite

00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:33,060
cross-platform and we also provide some

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:36,629
small subset of the libraries and

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,129
libraries for using on top of cute

00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:41,560
cailee frameworks is also cross-platform

00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:47,529
so you can use it on any hardware

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:50,020
possible we also have Queen Wayland as a

00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:52,960
compositor which provides various

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,930
rendering backends like erm kernel mode

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,830
setting which can be used on supported

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:03,069
for fairly mainline devices we also

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:06,419
provide HW composer back-end which can

00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:09,490
be used on Android only devices where

00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:14,469
where there is no way to get a DRM or

00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:16,659
kms not working and we also provide a

00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:18,849
minimal frame buffer back-end which is

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:22,719
like quite not not so performance so

00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:25,960
it's not too much recommended we also

00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:28,149
have some hardware specifics futures

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:32,110
included right now in the queue in Velen

00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:34,740
which is a TMF of support it is required

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,510
for some specific new devices like

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,649
purism slipped on five phone which is

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:44,470
going to use it Navi it which is going

00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:49,329
to use IMX both h4 so it will needed a

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,840
map of and while we provide this

00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:53,140
solution

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,370
we also provide solution to ship this to

00:08:53,140 --> 00:09:01,630
KD committed to the wider community like

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:04,390
we have a Yocto project recipes which I

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:08,590
think Qualcomm will talk about in his

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,510
talk I'm not sure we also have a kiddie

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:14,260
neon build infrastructure which builds

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:17,500
for armed HF and I'm 64 so you can

00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:20,860
basically put it on top of Google to

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,170
harm and we also have a community

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,470
efforts like post-market voice which

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:31,270
provides packaging solutions for KD

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:33,130
software so here you can see 13 yawn

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,120
well this is that actually dashed off

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:40,330
its surrounding on Pine book it's $99

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:43,570
seam single board computer we have clean

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:47,320
running kiddie neon it plasma while

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:50,860
running on Nexus 5x we have post

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,120
marketer is running plasma mobile on the

00:09:50,860 --> 00:10:00,400
point 64 phone we also have a Yocto

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:04,110
project page raspberry pi and apart from

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,460
just generally apart from just garrys

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,040
software solutions there are also some

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,890
external salt external companies

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,900
external communities which are working

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:17,680
for making this whole process easier

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,930
like there is a graphics driver

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,900
community there is a kernel development

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:25,600
and mainlining communities which work on

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,840
making these software's more much more

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,910
open there is several other companies

00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,520
like point 64 and purism

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:38,050
which will which work on providing

00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:41,380
hardware as much as open as possible and

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:42,670
well some people say that is new

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,420
hardware we should fix it

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:48,310
yes it's a risk we hardware which is

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,500
supposed to fix all of the hardware

00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:54,670
problems but we are yet to see in the

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:57,310
practice so anyway I will hand over to

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,940
Morocco who will talk about plasma

00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,940
side of things

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:10,860
so when to actually decide I want to use

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:13,140
plasma in my embedded art or project of

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,990
course different different hardware's

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:20,430
and different use cases are very

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:25,260
different from one another both in on a

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:29,330
side of of performance of the particular

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:33,209
art where will it will it be probably

00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:37,950
powerful enough to run to run what I

00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:44,070
need or also on on a side of you user

00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:47,370
experience does my hardware only need to

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:51,180
show ever one single screen it's like

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:57,000
it's like a stupid soda vending machine

00:11:51,180 --> 00:12:01,640
or is it something more complicated many

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,450
times even even in very simple things

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:11,370
you do have some concept in some in some

00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:13,770
way of applications even if is even if

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,360
they are really applications but just

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,839
different functionality of the system

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:22,800
but that you need to start to switch

00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:26,459
among and to terminate then you need

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,520
something that in some way acts as a as

00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:34,020
a primary user interface as a point of

00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:39,660
entry for the user also many times you

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:44,820
will need things like notifications or

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:47,579
things like a status area for for things

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:51,870
like the battery charge or the network

00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:55,110
connectivity and also having some UI to

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:59,220
to be able to configure that network

00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:01,770
connectivity for instance just just a

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,200
simple simple login to a Wi-Fi network

00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:08,930
which is which is

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:12,300
very common and for all those problems

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,730
plasma has a completely rating from

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:21,030
structure as an excellent notification

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:23,910
system has good good wrappers on top of

00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:26,550
phone on a network manager that makes

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:29,010
the developer that wants to do an

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:34,260
interface on top of them actually not

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:37,200
painful which is a lot but what you say

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,950
plasma is a complete desktop desktop

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,030
experience I don't want that in my in my

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,460
embedded device my embedded device

00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:48,360
something completely different and much

00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:51,510
smaller but what plasma shell actually

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,850
is and in this context I am strictly

00:13:51,510 --> 00:14:00,420
referring to the plasma shell executable

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:05,390
it's I kind of a glorified qml viewer

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:09,270
which is by itself quite quite tiny

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:12,690
quite light and doesn't have doesn't

00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:16,620
have any UI by itself all the UID that

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:21,060
loads is what in the end the developer

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:26,040
says says to it - to load in the form of

00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:28,860
first the shell package and the

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,550
containments and then the widgets I will

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:37,110
define all of that starting with the

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:40,110
shell package which is the the lower

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:47,220
level things that it loads in the form

00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:50,460
of of kml files and configuration files

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:55,560
it defines the behavior of the target

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:58,649
system starting we already have several

00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,259
of them we have

00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:05,879
the most known and used which is the

00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:08,490
desktop but the phone on plasma mobile

00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,319
has a completely different one even

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,529
plasma viewer which is just a small

00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:16,949
testing utility it's a it's a whole

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:20,879
different different shell package by

00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:23,040
itself and lately we are working on on a

00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:27,529
new one called plasma Nano which is

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,240
targeted explicitly for embedded devices

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:32,730
here there are some some examples of

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,629
course plasma desktop with that we all

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,149
know and love

00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:39,449
then plasma mobile running on a phone

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:42,300
which is Hg which is a quite

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:46,199
differential but yet kind of familiar on

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:50,100
the bottom row there are three

00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:54,920
prototypes based on the new tiny plasma

00:15:50,100 --> 00:16:00,540
nano shell they are all prototypes of

00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:02,839
complete U is based around mycroft which

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,540
is a free software a voice assistant

00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:09,059
with the other target that shouldn't

00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,059
have Google listening to everything you

00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:17,399
say to it which is really nice the one

00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:20,490
on the on the left is Mycroft mark 2

00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:24,089
which hopefully we will be actually able

00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:27,480
to buy and it will hopefully become an

00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:30,600
real product in the middle a prototype

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:34,879
for for a largest great version on the

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:37,379
right and automotive prototype which

00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:42,209
Aditya will have a talk about it so

00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:44,939
everyone is invited to see that here

00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:47,790
comes the wall of text just just being

00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:51,350
very quickly those are the various

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:55,009
components that that defines various

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:58,769
customizations for instance a

00:16:55,009 --> 00:17:01,470
configuration dialog of things can vary

00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:06,000
a lot between shells here is the desktop

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:07,959
shell it has an appearance he is here is

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,459
in the Nano shell looks

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,189
differently but also behaves differently

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:16,439
on the desktop it as the apply ok apply

00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:20,409
cancel button instead on plasma nano is

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:23,890
everything is instant apply same thing

00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:26,890
for widget Explorer which plasma desktop

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:29,860
and plasma Nano things like that a shell

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,590
could also say I don't want any of that

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:36,429
in my shell I want to be simpler you can

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:39,399
also define that behavior the main views

00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:41,230
a desktop is address with the rest of

00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:42,940
the panel's upon is a panel but on the

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,179
phone the panel works differently

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,429
becames a scroll down draw a kind of

00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:51,250
like Android and also the desktop

00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:54,850
behaves differently horizontal swipe

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:59,380
becomes activity switcher which is all

00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:02,020
defined in the rest package as I said

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,149
all the new prototypes with smaller

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:07,059
advices we are doing with plasma Nano

00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:09,549
even plasma mobile will be based on

00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:15,390
plasma nano because one shell package

00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:18,779
can kind of inherit from another one

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:23,320
then the main UI that it's loaded is

00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:28,240
containments which is on the desktop the

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:31,149
kind of file manager UI that is icon on

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:36,399
desktops and on the phone is the is the

00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:40,149
main launcher you can also customize

00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:44,860
more with luke and fill package which is

00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:49,480
just cosmetic stuff and very quickly

00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:53,080
because we are running out of time this

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:56,049
is the mycroft mark to package which i

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,169
talked about this is a very very early

00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:02,950
prototype it did the final version we

00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:06,700
have a nice case you talk to the device

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,500
and the device answer is to you with

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,049
voice and with a graphical

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,970
representation of the answer all of that

00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:20,870
is in a plasma shell and it also has

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:24,590
a top-down panel for configuring network

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:29,360
for controlling sound volume and things

00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:34,430
like that if you want to know more there

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:37,310
will be a above session on Tuesday

00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:40,040
everyone is invited I hope to see many

00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:43,000
of you I don't know if we still have

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,000
time for questions

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,430
