Title: Neofytos Kolokotronis - All On Board! Are We There Yet? - Akademy 2019
Publication date: 2020-05-25
Playlist: Akademy 2019
Description: 
	The KDE mother ship has been sailing towards the "Streamlined Onboarding" land for almost 2 years now. I often ask myself if this goal will ever be reached. Will it ever be concluded? This talk is an attempt to answer this question. It should be interesting and hopefully inspiring to everyone in the KDE community.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,390
so hi everyone my name is Neffe dose

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,639
enough being coordinating or being the

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,700
onboarding keeper as he won mention it

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,160
earlier for the last couple of years so

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,929
as with the previous calls I'm here to

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,510
tell you what we have been doing over

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,859
the last couple of years and see how we

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,630
can move forward with that so the issue

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,970
with onboarding is that when you are

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,189
joining a new community most of the time

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,859
you start feeling like you are alone you

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,140
have lots of documentation to read lots

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:37,050
of processes to learn lots of code to

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,940
study so the whole idea of onboarding is

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,920
to make that easier for people that are

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,980
coming into our community and try to

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,899
help them make their first commit and

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,940
hopefully stick around and commit in the

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,350
long run so we can maintain the

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,570
sustainability of our community so as

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,539
you can see there are many ways to

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,480
actually treat a newcomer the whole idea

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:05,220
of this goal is to choosing like the

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,040
this one patting newcomers trying to not

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,720
explode them or shoot them down when

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,930
they are starting to make their first

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,670
steps so be welcoming offer your

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,890
guidance and if you are doing that

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:22,650
give a path to yourself for being an

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:24,810
awesome on board there this is what I

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,729
took at the Nuremburg spin which was a

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,650
kiddie mega spin as we called it because

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,400
there were three parallel spins there

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,950
for Queen Katy correct and the

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,079
unburdening goal and what I love about

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,640
this picture is that for me is

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,100
everything that onboarding should be

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,850
about you can clearly see the three

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,439
David's there that's David Farrer who's

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,770
there

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,829
Debbie that monsoon was there and

00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:56,009
redondo I don't think he's with us today

00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:58,469
anyway so yeah it's great to see these

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,409
three David's collaborating together you

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,930
know to solve an issue so that's amazing

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,590
you can see three generations so David's

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,990
as well three generations

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,270
it's three generations of AD

00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,069
contributors actually david on the left

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,000
has been around i don't know from the

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:18,290
start probably for very early years and

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,819
he always has these awesome kitty

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:26,030
t-shirts that I've never seen in the

00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:28,370
past yeah we should have some KD retro

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,069
t-shirt or something I think so yeah

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,020
Bevin has been also here for a while and

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,750
David the Dondon the right puzzle we've

00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,120
been with us for two years I think he C

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,190
been a young student doing already doing

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,019
amazing things so yeah this is a point

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,420
of a morning for me you can see them

00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:48,290
also smiling so this is a happy process

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,489
for them it's important actually to be

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,319
able to enjoy what you're doing and

00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:53,180
trying to solve our issue I don't know

00:02:51,319 --> 00:03:07,280
if you solved it invent whatever go

00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:09,800
working okay okay so yeah hopefully we

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,110
fix that so yeah it's all about doing

00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,150
that so we can get commitment in order

00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:16,519
to move forward and being able to

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:20,750
sustain this flow of income and

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,790
competitors now the goals in general

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,549
when they were voided they were it was

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,170
suggested to be like very big goals like

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,329
things that we would work or in the long

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,799
term it's they were not supposed to be

00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:32,989
thought about that something that will

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,540
work for a couple of years and then drop

00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:38,030
them and this is the whole idea here so

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,500
at times it might feel it might feel

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,209
that we're not doing enough it might

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,670
feel that there's still lots of work to

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,690
be done but that doesn't mean that we

00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,609
should then move forward of course and

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,980
when I was trying to gather things

00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:53,900
around in order to do to make this call

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,579
these talk and prepare for this talk I

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,180
realized that we have achieved a lot

00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:00,890
during these 18 months I want to get

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,930
started by the community that's at least

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:06,620
for me a very very important aspect of

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:09,109
this so we have managed to have very

00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,910
high participation of newcomers in in

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:12,890
Academy over the last years and

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,349
hopefully was like that in the past I

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,289
think this year is around only three

00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,350
persons around and it was the same last

00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:22,300
year which is it great to have so many

00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,510
around to start being involved in to

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,460
Katie and for newcomers here don't be

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,200
afraid to be shy try to meet with the

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,480
other people it might be intimidating at

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,890
the beginning but to get involved try to

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,830
go to the workshops try to learn

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,270
whatever you can and meet the people and

00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,800
the projects that you want to get

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,300
involved most projects will have

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,090
workshops and things like that that it

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,750
can get involved it was the same at the

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,080
sprints

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,880
we had I think eight or ten sprints this

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,430
year and it was great to see so many

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,230
newcomers involved there as well and of

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,520
course my understanding is that compared

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,370
at least to the previous year you have

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,130
many new kdv me even members around 10

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,630
or 12 now I don't know but the numbers

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,760
has said an increase compared to last

00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,530
year at least so that's great

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,590
it means that we're doing well on the

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:11,710
community front another thing we did in

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,510
terms of the communities that we started

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,270
talking and forming a Katie welcome team

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,550
and the whole idea for this is to have

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,250
it go to place where newcomers will be

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,770
able to join the channel we currently

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,530
hosted on the matrix for which I'll talk

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,420
a bit later and the idea is to have a

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,850
place where newcomers can join and ask

00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,070
all those silly questions and see how

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,720
they can get involved and try to have

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,040
people to be amazing with them and

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,280
respond and be the first line of

00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,110
response to people and hopefully the

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,000
goal here is to have at least one

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,670
representative from any project or team

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,190
to join this channel so we can direct

00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,960
them to you if the people that are

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,280
asking or how to get involve

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,510
are actually interested to get involved

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,250
in your projects so if you haven't

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,350
joined yet think about in your project

00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,380
and team if you can have some person

00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,730
joining here and thank you to the people

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,080
that have been doing some great work in

00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,850
the Welcome team I think Valerie

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,290
imbibition and other people have been

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:11,170
very active there and it's great to see

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:13,330
that so switching to tools now a big

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,180
thing over the last year or more baby

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,100
who has been the physician to develop we

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,460
have been working with the gitlab people

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:24,460
very closely over the last year we are

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,650
nowadays at the final stages let's say

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,169
of the whole process that started you

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,910
know we're trying to work together we

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,430
get lump in order to make this work for

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,060
both gitlab and Katie there's still work

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,940
to be done

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:40,090
but we're very closely the sysadmin team

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,040
has been doing when Bhushan at least huh

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,720
I've been doing amazing work in order to

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,669
get this started we have already said a

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,919
bad test environment or invented carried

00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:50,110
the dork we invited teams to join us

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,610
there in order to see what works and

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,980
what doesn't for us try to get some

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,100
feedback communicated back to get laughs

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,960
and hopefully everything would work out

00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:03,340
for the best interpret for this to move

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:06,010
on the reasons of the chose did lab was

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,260
obviously the familiar wear flow we

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,570
believe that new developers nowadays

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,090
will be much more accustomed to to like

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,290
it lab that's widely adopted everywhere

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,479
and it's been adopted by other

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,669
open-source communities at all so I

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,870
think Debian and norm and other

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:24,820
communities as well it has for that

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,370
reason a lower entry barrier as people

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,620
and new developers are moral are more

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,060
used to that workflow nowadays so that's

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,010
important for us as well and of course

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,139
it's being actively developed and backed

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,660
by a company and a big open source

00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,210
community of course this doesn't come

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,250
with any any challenges without any

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,710
challenges so big part of that is

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,590
inertia we don't usually accept change

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,330
very easily so and of course the fact

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,860
that people have been a custom

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,050
fabricated or in other tools that people

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,150
have been using so far that complicates

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,530
things are obviously some work follows

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,840
will be breaking as you need to

00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,580
transition to a new tool so we're trying

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,830
our best in order to avoid that and make

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,680
the transition as simple as possible and

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:07,539
there are still some pending issues that

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,760
were trying to resolve with gitlab so we

00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:16,000
can proceed and make this like a final

00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:18,250
change in switch so get lab is here in

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,169
its present academy and i will thank

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,820
them for that i see right here from grid

00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,000
lab and I don't know if David is here as

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,729
well

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,919
no no so it's good to have you here

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:29,440
thank you for this sponsorship as well

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,169
and I think you have a workshop Saddam

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,669
and also talk later in the day so to

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,770
join there to learn more about the

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,839
gitlab open-source project we get lab

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,510
community how you can get involved on

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,780
tribute and learn some about the

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:47,020
workflows that are being used so you can

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,010
get involved now a second tool that we

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,690
just use

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,610
in collaboration with the Metis

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:55,329
community who have been very generous in

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:58,329
or in terms of hosting a server for us

00:08:55,329 --> 00:09:01,120
an official KD server let's same the

00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:03,700
reason we moved with this is that as IQ

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,100
mentioned we believe that Dryad is much

00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,540
closer aligned to our values and where

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,490
we want to be in terms of the

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,380
open-source community compared to other

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,839
tools that we know that our developers

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:17,220
used nowadays like telegram which is

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,980
obviously very convenient and useful and

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,690
it gets the job done probably but we

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,209
wanted to have a go to menu that is

00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,709
close to us and what we do is so for our

00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,360
communications we wanted to have a place

00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:30,730
where people could join and then they

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,610
could find their work their way into the

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,350
kindy project and channels where so we

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:41,350
have everything hosted under one roof

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:43,209
that you can join now also this was

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,740
actually fabricated maxilla improvements

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,380
was actually another goal a second and

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,790
it's a fourth call that was suggested

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,620
back in the days when the girls were

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,390
initiated and it got adopted into their

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,490
boarding call because we can consider it

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,089
was important one the whole idea was to

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,560
that Nate proposed Negra and was to

00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:01,449
simplify some part of the registration

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,160
process and change something so the

00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:05,860
workflow so it would make fabricator

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,540
work better for us and what we also did

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,760
in order to improve the process for

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,790
newcomers is was to adopt the junior

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,230
jobs tags so people coming in could

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,540
browser projects they want to get

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,370
involved and find some jobs and backs

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,920
that they could easily solve in

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:24,550
collaboration with alter developers or

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:27,070
experienced contributors that is finally

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,740
on in terms of documentation there's

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,630
been lots of work on updating and

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,640
maintaining updated because that's very

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,730
important to maintain all the

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:40,810
documentation updated on our website so

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:43,329
they get involved website and a lot of

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,829
that work was done by the usability and

00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:47,199
productivity people and the team that

00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:50,170
worked on that so it's been updated a

00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:54,100
lot of compare where we had two years

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:56,230
ago and also they they read decided that

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,029
it's good time to hire someone to work

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,420
on the commutation so they could assess

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:03,420
the whole situation

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,769
try to point us towards the future and

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,889
what we need to work on and what we need

00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,230
to improve in order to to improve the

00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:12,360
documentation as well so we've been

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,310
doing work on that as well now in

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,230
general we help we help several main

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,759
activities for the goals in the

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,620
onboarding goal as well which give us a

00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,899
lot of promotion both inside the open

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,880
source community and outside of that we

00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,040
held several ire C office hours where

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,389
people come in and ask questions and

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,910
learn more about the goals and KD in

00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:31,649
general we also did a couple of reddit

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,420
ask me anything sessions as well which

00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,579
were very well received

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,620
I think they gathered around 300 to 400

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,880
comments the last one and through all

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,380
that we've been gathering a lot of

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,970
feedback about new contributors now to

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,800
talk a bit more about the multi-speed

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:51,060
that took place in a couple of months

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,980
ago there were around 20 to 25 kenny

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,230
contributors they're discussing we split

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,839
the sprint in two days we tried in the

00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,790
first part to realize what we have been

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,370
doing so far and the various ways of

00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,069
doing doing things and how people set up

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,990
a development environment now it

00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:08,790
actually turned out that there were at

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,199
least four the more experienced users

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,060
there are at least five to six different

00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:15,240
ways to set up a developer environment

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,040
and those are not necessarily the same

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,439
with what we have been asking newcomers

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,000
to do so that's not necessary but

00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:23,189
because we want a more experienced user

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,259
to be able to set up their system in any

00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:26,970
way that gets them to be productive but

00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:29,480
at the same times it makes it much more

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,800
difficult to maintain and sustain a

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,560
standard let's say way of doing things

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,120
in terms of cádiz or spits that who have

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,920
been doing so far that it's a tool that

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,180
has been helping us so far but we want

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,250
to look ahead and see what are the

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,949
challenges and how we can continue

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:47,069
improving on that case so we came up

00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:49,170
with two possible solutions

00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:50,579
one was the use in Conan with each I

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,529
don't know if I'm saying right but I

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:55,589
think it's a cute package manager of

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:57,540
some sort and the other is using a

00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:59,430
combination between can develop and fly

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,949
apart in order to make the whole process

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,110
a bit more straightforward a bit easier

00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:06,480
and hopefully using a GUI so people

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,160
would can just click click click

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,199
download something and click again and

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,089
start they have their development

00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:15,089
environments adapt without

00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:17,670
to resolve to going to them CLI

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:19,319
environment and all that so on the

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,089
second day we tried to test for this to

00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:24,449
position two solutions possible

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:26,790
solutions there's been some work done in

00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:28,279
order to understand to what extent and

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,870
what level we are today in order to

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,860
implementing them and there's still lots

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,199
of work to be done

00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,040
hopefully we'll follow up on that in

00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:40,050
order to to move forward to move forward

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,480
with the solution so this is one of the

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,879
things that still requires a lot of work

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,040
in order to have an actual result to

00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,370
have an actual solution that we can give

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,139
to users another major task that at

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,519
least hasn't been closed over these two

00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:58,800
years is the website redesign I know

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,930
Jonathan and Karl don't know this year

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,019
have been doing yeah having doing some

00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,269
great work on the design of the website

00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:08,399
from the important part one major thing

00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:11,279
that we believe needs to be changes to

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,499
have a more straightforward path for

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,870
newcomers maybe we can be more active in

00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:17,759
suggesting ways they can get they can

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,259
get started with contributing we

00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,360
nowadays have to get involved website

00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:23,759
which is like a wiki but what would be

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,319
good for me I think it would be to be

00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,480
able to come go to them and say hey

00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:29,399
these are five apps you can get started

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,740
these are five simple apps you don't

00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,629
have to get started with plasma or KDP

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,209
more complicated stuff like that so we

00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:37,949
can be more active in terms of proposing

00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,290
new projects guiding them to the

00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:41,879
resources of those projects and finding

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,809
the right mentors for them to get

00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:49,470
involved so and of course there are many

00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:51,889
other minor things that we can work in

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,749
the future now the biggest thing for me

00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:57,509
at least in terms of the that surprised

00:14:54,749 --> 00:15:00,660
me the most after having the goal that I

00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:02,759
tested being voted him was how much I

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,800
saw the Catie community adopting this

00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,149
goal and not just this cauldron boarding

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,120
on but not the three ones so I think

00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:10,769
that's a major win for the whole goals

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,370
initiative and I'm glad to see it be

00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:16,139
continued of course I made up those

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,509
codes there but if you've been following

00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:22,379
the rickety community mailing list

00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:24,840
channels responses on various media and

00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:27,029
you all have seen a comment like that

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,060
and that's what makes it great for me

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,710
that you have you have you will realize

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,810
that people are adopted if they embrace

00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,370
it and they they started thinking about

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,340
it when they were proposing a new

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:42,990
solution or something in a discussion of

00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:46,980
course we have stats as well thanks to

00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:48,570
Nikolas who provided sorry the Pope

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:53,220
provided the stats for me at the

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:55,740
important sprint so what he sees what

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,260
you see here with the blue line are the

00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,810
contributors over the years that came to

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,300
our community and make just one commit

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,130
so you can clearly see that over the

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,770
last two or three years we have made

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,680
several improvements of that front this

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,210
of course has to do with both the work

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,160
that the ghost team have you doing and

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,200
the promo T at the same time I think

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,850
that's where you guys came around and

00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,130
started forming the team and doing work

00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,140
actually so it seems like we are doing

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,630
very well in terms of getting people in

00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,700
and making their first commit where we

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,130
really need to improve is on these

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,010
fronts this is a five commits then

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,600
commit and 20 commit so we need to

00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,210
figure out ways on how to get that

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,100
higher at the same time because you can

00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:41,850
see that we are not that far away from

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,950
the renown 2010 peak of in terms of

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,580
production and productivity and new

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:49,410
contributors in KD but we still not did

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,100
me to do a lot of work in order to keep

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:55,589
the people around having them stick into

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:59,450
our community so we need to improve on

00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:01,589
that from him to some somebody's up

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:05,310
having been working and coordinating

00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:07,980
this goal after two years I think there

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:10,290
are many things we can do to increase

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,510
the some of our community we've been

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:15,569
working on breaking newcomer scene but I

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,429
think there is work to be done on how we

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,949
interact on how we do things and how we

00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:23,550
communicate in order for our individual

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:27,360
efforts to have like a higher result a

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:29,400
higher impact in the end because I think

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,810
that's the whole thing about it doing

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,810
work with others and collaborating in

00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:37,350
order to have a bigger impact so that's

00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:38,580
my personal appeal now finally after

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,669
this

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,470
we'll have a panel where you will get a

00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:47,000
chance to learn about the new codes that

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:51,000
our community has voted in the last I

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,789
think two weeks three so I'm anxious to

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,090
learn without the giggles of course we

00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:59,130
need new paths to work on as I mentioned

00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,990
I feel like we have adopted that their

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,750
previous goals and it doesn't mean that

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,330
we should stop working on them but it's

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:09,080
good to have new goals in order to move

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:12,330
into the future and adjust our routes

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,570
going forward so that's it for me thank

00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,570
you

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:35,900
any questions thanks a lot for working

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:39,020
with them and especially pleased to see

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,490
the move away from IRC to matrix that's

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,890
been a personal bug there it's not

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,530
perfect but I didn't I think it's good

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:47,510
to have progress do what do you think

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,630
about moving away from mailman and

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:52,610
updating the current forums towards this

00:18:50,630 --> 00:19:05,870
course others other communities have

00:18:52,610 --> 00:19:08,870
done yeah okay probably that's how I

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:11,300
turn it off so yeah definitely think

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,850
that mailing lists are something that

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,790
new people are probably not accustomed

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,590
to nowadays and our forum from what I

00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,330
see at least is not that active nowadays

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,850
it's more or less being replaced by

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:25,880
telegram groups and reddit most probably

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:29,120
so if we can find a solution that will

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,680
actually solve what we're and resolve

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,140
the issues that the other channels are

00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,050
having I'm I can't see why we shouldn't

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,940
move on and I thought that I know I

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,680
these course have been assassinated

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,420
adopted in various communities already

00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,730
and it can work as a mailing list I

00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,520
think as well I've seen interaction so

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,860
yeah let's work on it and see if we can

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:53,840
convince the community to adopt it like

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:56,300
all the other things as we are running

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,730
out of time so if you guys have any

00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:02,950
questions please ask near in person

00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,950
that's it thank you thank you

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,550
