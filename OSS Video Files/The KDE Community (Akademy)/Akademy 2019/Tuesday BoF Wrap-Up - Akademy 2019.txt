about moving the new documentation for

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,380
second free for users to user base

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,409
instead of our own wiki and same for the

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:30,240

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,369
wiki and then with iishe we worked on or

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,290

accessibility to make some activities

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:41,299

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:13,620
now you get to tell us about it yeah so

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,750
this was first love him off in a while

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:24,120
so that was nice we talked about a set

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:29,280
of things instance we would like to

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:33,959
adopt okay user feedback but we need to

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:39,959
figure out how he would like to move to

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:45,959
get lab we need to figure out when and

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:51,390
then there was alexander talked about

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:54,720
his ki yo fuse project which was highly

00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:59,010
requested by users that's almost

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:04,670
finished we need to wait to finish it

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:08,390
and release it basically and finally

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:13,019
mavin talked about his recent work on

00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:16,470
the places panel and how he is going to

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,430
improve on that later that's it

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,240
basically

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,310
[Music]

00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:26,610
[Applause]

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,860
Thank You Elvis Karl ran the website

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:37,560
Boff so it let's go on Karl to say

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:39,930
something so I did the website off we

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,080
spoke about the current state of the

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,670
websites so you have a lot of website

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:53,160
isn't multiple technologies and which

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:57,810
teams and yeah and then we move it to

00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,210
the one of the first things I needed to

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:05,030
do it's a moving away from the capacity

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:08,000
homework it's all framework from what is

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:11,340
maintaining our website from khadiyah

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,150
and then we spoke to some of the

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,950
kinetics or to translations because we

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,990
need to capacity for salvation of the

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:24,410
website we need to fill lacerations okay

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,410
what's it

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,059
[Applause]

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:35,349
thanks Carly you do amazing work for us

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:40,689
Kai this is a notification respond to

00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:43,990
the notification o K notifications with

00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:45,580
Kai so we brainstormed ideas on how to

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,469
fix the history because I'm well aware

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,210
it's not ideal right now so stop sending

00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:51,939
me back reports about it

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,469
we also brainstorm ideas for new K

00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:55,120
notification class with fewer

00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:57,159
dependencies and platform plugins and

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
stuff like that and also less surprises

00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:00,849
in using the API switch needs to box and

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:09,159
crashes and of course the notes are

00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:11,469
linked and the wiki page good show the

00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:13,689
next four buffs in that room where our

00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:22,689
plasma plasma plasma and plasma so it

00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:25,439
likes to call on Bhushan let's delegate

00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,439
to Dave hey Dave

00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:32,740
everything was cleverly split into

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,569
independent modules the first discussion

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,930
was system settings where we discussed

00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:40,000
system settings topics included dealing

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,669
with the legacy modules which we decided

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,800
we would fix it how to integrate plasma

00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:47,229
settings and general system settings I

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,750
would decided we would fix it it comes

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:52,870
in consistency and list views and we

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,550
decided we would fix it and then we had

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,500
a big heated discussion about instant

00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:03,610
apply where we didn't decide anything

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:09,000
where we said we would fix it yes

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,000
foni was that simple station

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,990
[Music]

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:24,699
we kind of decided that it would be

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:31,029
tried as a pilots on some modules

00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:33,249
probably how actually she took that to

00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:35,999
the users and communicate that to the

00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:38,949
user without having an inconsistent

00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:41,469
inconsistent thing for a long time that

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:50,249
is a problem that still needs to be

00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:50,249
decided in our notes on the wiki Bouchon

00:07:51,749 --> 00:08:03,339
so we had plasma from the at 11:30 and

00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:05,139
we discussed I mean like lots of topic

00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:06,029
and we actually eventually run out of

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,949
time

00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:11,229
so there is a possibility that we might

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:14,559
organize another of the Thursday's to

00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:18,189
get rid of four remaining topics but

00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:21,699
mostly we discussed about how to reach

00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:25,120
out to more developers and how to

00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:29,319
improve the current state of the plasma

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:33,639
mobile and how to how to make sure our

00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:36,969
website is up to standard and things

00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:48,459
like that we have not added notes in a

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:53,380
wiki page we have and come after that we

00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:56,829
had this pop about plasma on toaster

00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:00,180
devices which was kind of lie plasma

00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:04,300
will never run on your toaster but

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:07,329
nevertheless we discussed about having

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,240
PD plasma of KDE technology on this

00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:14,759
specific set of embedded or IOT

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:18,430
specifically like devices and we also

00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:21,270
seen a demo of plasma and of shell by

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:25,570
marco Martin and

00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:29,320
there was some ideas around how this

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:32,160
technology should be distributed how

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,350
this technology can be better demo to

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:43,210
the interest rate parties and yeah

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:50,110
that's it thanks Bhushan next up in that

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:53,580
room was knee on the road to 2004 Harold

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:56,320
tell me I'm wrong you're not wrong

00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:01,120
except it's not pronounced 2004 it's

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,730
2004 so we looked at the possibility of

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,950
very likely an entirely feasible cause a

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,560
possibility of us moving to an a boon to

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:13,410
2004 base when it comes out which will

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,790
be in 2020 hence the 20 unfortunately

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,580
unfortunately the last time around we

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,840
figured out a really good process so we

00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,130
basically made a list of all the stuff

00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,230
that we need to do and it's gonna be

00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,910
awesome and should be much faster than

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,910
last time thank you

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:33,420
[Applause]

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,959
there was a GPG signing thing run by

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,850
handles it went well

00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:42,529
we mumbled numbers at each other it was

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,529
great fun you should join next year

00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:55,399
alright moving on to the next room in

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,399
the morning there was the KDE India boss

00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:06,200
so mostly about why we were not able to

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:09,450
host company in for last two years and

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:14,240
how to make the next company natural

00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:19,320
possibility and fill reality so we

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:23,820
agreed that we have one when we have two

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:26,430
possible venues and we should try and

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,770
see if we can get confirmation from one

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,120
when you buy October months and if it

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,399
doesn't happen we should move on to

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,649
second when you and tried try and make

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,190
this possible for at least 2020 because

00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:41,910
for 2019 it's kind of slightly over late

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:46,640
and we also discussed about where our

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:49,709
website and our conference website and I

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:55,170
think we I need to consult to call about

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:58,350
this our new website so yes I think it

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:04,370
was mostly about next to the conference

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:04,370
of pain either 2019 very end or 2020

00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,039
[Applause]

00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,290
okay bringing your KDE applications to

00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:21,300
more interesting places the KDE Windows

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:21,300
and Mac sorry KDE crafts off with Hana

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:31,300
yeah we I demonstrated how craft can be

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:33,550
used and how easy just to bring your

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,029
application to Windows if you'd done

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:39,660
your vacation right and how you can get

00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:48,459
into the store later on site that was

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:50,709
everything thank you and still

00:12:48,459 --> 00:13:02,230
connecting up all the bits is the KDE

00:12:50,709 --> 00:13:04,660
connect both we are discussing how we

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,350
can make Katie connect even more amazing

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,110
and first of all the first step to this

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,300
is to actually make a release with all

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,750
the awesome stuff we've piled up for

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:22,720
this we resolved a blocking bug and now

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:25,509
we can make nearly soon next we were

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,639
discussing some issues sadly with the

00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:31,029
latest Android version clipboard access

00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:34,839
is broken because of some Android

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:37,899
privacy policy and we were thinking

00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,240
about ways how to make the features the

00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:43,720
word but unfortunately we don't have a

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,040
really good solution next we are talking

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,509
about the strategy for making a first

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,970
official release of KDE connect on

00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:56,170
Windows and the Mac OS so those users

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,899
can enjoy our awesomeness - then we

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,540
discussed some refinements to the

00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:04,949
features we have particularly with the

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:08,769
notification plug-in and last we

00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:11,920
discussed how to tackle certain privacy

00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:14,769
issue that we have in KDE connect so we

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,949
can fulfill our goal of achieving

00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:20,800
privacy for our users but unfortunately

00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:22,270
we don't have a very good solution yet

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:32,320
but we have some idea

00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:32,710
that might be worth considering thank

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,380
you

00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:39,160
in the last room it was hacking all day

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,990
and I didn't achieve anything but other

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:49,240
people may have so anyone wants to talk

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:51,910
about their hacking experience so two

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,540
different boots I was working with the

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:57,820
post-market OS team for running for the

00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,920
issues which are physically kind of

00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,490
blocking plasma while on the pine phone

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,700
and we basically made a list of various

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:09,070
small issues and large issues and try to

00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,190
see what is sub probably possible

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,460
solutions for it and yeah and I think it

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,590
was quite successful hacking sessions

00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:20,500
another debate was also Daniel was

00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:24,640
working on a key accounts integration

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:28,180
with KML and contact and we have now

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:32,800
agreed upon creating a new path tomorrow

00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:36,220
at 11:30 I think about the online

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,470
account integration with all of the

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,720
kiddie applications and the pain points

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,759
about it so yeah

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,759
[Music]

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,810
[Applause]

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,060
all right spiffy that wraps up the buff

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,760
wrap-up and I'd like to see everyone

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,889
tomorrow bright and early and don't

00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,600
forget the day trip and remember to link

00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,600
your notes see you tomorrow

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:05,830
