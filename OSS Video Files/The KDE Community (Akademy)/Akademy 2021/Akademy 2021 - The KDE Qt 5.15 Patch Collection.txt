services out there is tsdg eos

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,200
i know it's hard don't try to pronounce

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,520
it just write it

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,000
okay so uh i cannot change the slides

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
i can change these lights good uh so a

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,719
bit of who i

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,320
uh i'm being a developer in kde since

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,360
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,399
i'm very close to my 20th anniversary

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,719
already

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,000
so that's a lot uh obviously since i've

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
been

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
in kd for a long time i've done a lot of

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,799
things uh just a few

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,680
things there to mention kpdf that later

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,080
became ocular

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
i've been doing translations both like

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,119
translating to catalan

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,799
and the co-coordinator with luigi

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,280
for the translators i've been doing

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,400
releases

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,400
of kdg gear and all the things that we

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,439
named before kd gear that are the same

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,479
thing

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,880
worked with games edu i was the

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,479
founding president of kde espana which

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,400
is the local

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,040
association for kde in spain i was a

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,479
board member for the kdev so yeah a bit

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,240
of everything

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,399
uh now you maybe already know that

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
uh knew that because i've been engaging

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,479
for a long time

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,240
uh and people meet me here but uh this

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,000
talk is all about cube right so let me

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,759
speak about the good side

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,280
uh cute is a bit more strict than us

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,640
kde while giving people committing

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,560
powers

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,039
so they are

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,319
that you can they you can confuse a lot

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,200
of patches and still not get

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,800
approval uh rights which approval rights

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,800
means you can approve somebody else's

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,480
patches right so i got a cute approval

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,920
rights in 2018 which is fine i mean

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,720
uh i've contributed 400 patches which

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,000
depending who you ask but might be a lot

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,360
or might be not

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,440
a lot uh i think it's it's a

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
good number i don't feel like i've

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,160
contributed uh

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,720
huge amounts of code but yeah

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,640
i i know a bit how it works so i think

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,640
it's fair

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,720
uh so after the introduction

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,040
uh disclaimer this is my opinion right

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,680
this is not kde's opinion

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,640
this is not uh my employer's opinion

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,640
this is just

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,840
my opinion right because there's some

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,400
things we're gonna

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
talk about which are history and history

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,480
is more or less

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,959
set in stone so that's probably true

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,319
though it's always interpretable uh but

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,239
some of the things are gonna be

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,400
my interpretation on current events

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,200
right so just to make clear this is just

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,080
me

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,480
if you have to uh hate or flame someone

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,319
uh

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,480
hate me so a bit of history

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,159
uh i hope you all know cute is this

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,319
thing we use in kde to do

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,319
user interfaces right so it was

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,280
introduced in 1996

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,760
and it used something called the cute

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,200
free

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,840
edition license which uh

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,319
you could not redistribute so it made it

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,480
not be

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:52,400
free software right i'm gonna do a small

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,239
site here if you're ever

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
doing some software and you want to

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,040
write a license for it

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,200
do not write a license for it there's

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,599
already a gazillion of licenses out

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,920
there

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,239
that use peak one that really exists

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,360
writing a license is very very hard

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:13,280
so don't do it like just reuse something

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,680
it's i'm 99.99 sure

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
that there's a license out there that

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,079
does what you want right so just

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,120
it was right written by lawyers and all

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,880
those people that

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,000
know better than us engineers coders

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,759
whatever uh like to do so yeah don't do

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
that

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,520
then it happened that kde started using

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,320
cute and

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,479
and kd was so amazing compared to what

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,960
there was in linux uh before

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,080
people started to get worried right

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,759
because even though

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,000
kde was gpl q2 wasn't

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,759
and it wasn't even free so far right so

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,400
it was like oh what do we do here

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,240
like this is this is nice but it's not

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,600
nice because of the license

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,600
so uh the the kid people recognize that

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,080
and and in 1998

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,199
they they together with us they we

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,520
created this

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,440
thing called the kde cute foundation

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,039
which is always a mouthful to say right

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,280
and and the first thing that the

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,720
the foundation is which is very clear is

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,360
the purpose of the foundation

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,400
is guaranteeing that cute will be

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,960
available

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,919
for free software now and in the future

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,639
right so that's what

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,360
what the foundation is about the core

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,199
like the

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
mandate of the foundation is making sure

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,120
that happens right

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,680
and then there's a few other clauses

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
which are

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,039
uh supposed to be a bit about

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,240
getting the people that were developing

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,800
cute which

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,479
back then was troll tech uh i didn't

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
make a typo in the space if you look at

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,960
the announcement there's

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
there's a space there so i guess they

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,880
changed their naming

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,680
later because we all used to have to to

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,440
getting through

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,280
written together but the announcement

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,639
was uh with the space in the middle

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,759
so it's not my fault uh there's a few

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,319
clauses there that say

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
well i mean you know you have to release

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,680
uh

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,840
cute every so often and if you don't

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,280
it's gonna be

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,560
re-licensed well the foundation will

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,280
have the right to realize

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,080
under psd license there's all of

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
legalese

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,440
around that but so that's a bit to make

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,840
sure that

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,039
cube just keeps on developing and

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,120
releasing a free version of cube we

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,680
could use right

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,319
so moving a bit forward uh there's this

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,120
thing and

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,759
and we were using it was q1 and q2 and

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
q3

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,000
and q4 and eventually they have q5 right

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,479
well they've done a kid six now but

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
let's not uh get that of ourselves so

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,600
when they did give

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,960
good five they realized that well i mean

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,560
this is gonna be a big

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,319
change and and you know

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,680
let's let's make cute for that eight

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,720
loving them support

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,560
so this way we can have people stay in

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,039
cube parade for a while

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,720
uh while we make sure that q5 gets

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,919
mature enough and everything can be

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,400
ported to it right

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,479
and that was actually a very good idea

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,400
you can see that

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,880
plasma 5 was only released in in 2014 so

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,360
that's

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,280
two years after q5 right so it was a

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,199
whole two year that q5 was already

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,400
released

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,520
but plasma or whatever you would call it

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,160
kde

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,160
desktop uh back then i don't remember

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,800
plus my four already right yeah plasma

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
was still based on q4 right so it makes

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
sense to be

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,720
to pick having releases of q4 in case

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,560
there's a small bugs or

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
or whatever right so you can see that

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,759
the last kit for eight

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,639
release was in may 2015 so that's

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,080
four years after for eight so that

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,080
that's a very good decision

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
uh in my opinion from the cute company

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,919
but not a good company

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,520
uh i don't know who was developing cute

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,639
background probably still trolltech

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,400
or nokia i don't remember anyhow uh

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
the people that were developing cute

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,360
very good decision for them

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,400
making sure that we could use

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,240
a stable cube while we worked

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,960
on the next version of plasma that used

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,960
the new cube right

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,440
so fast forward a bit more and then we

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,680
get q5 right and q5

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,680
so in q4 they had never had the concept

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,120
of long-term support

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:23,680
until the last version right until q4.8

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,960
in q5 they introduced the concept a bit

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,160
more and every three versions after five

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,680
six you got a

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,520
long-term support right so you've got

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
five six five nine five twelve and five

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,919
fifteen

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,120
as long time support uh

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,680
q512 it's still supported as long-term

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,080
support there was a release

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,720
in may this year so there was a i don't

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
remember the

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,360
dot i think it was 5 12 11 so

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,200
they've been doing 512 for a while and

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,240
they did another one

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,240
just in may this year

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,839
one of the things that happened last

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,880
year in january is that

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,730
they announced that q515

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,800
wouldn't uh

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,560
[Music]

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,360
it would be lps but only for commercial

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,839
customers right which is like

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,040
that's not cool right because okay

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,959
whatever i mean

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,680
you do do this like most of the people

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,040
doing uh the cute development are from

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,720
the kid company so

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,320
sure you could you get to decide that

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,080
but

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,240
one of the reasons they they argued

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,240
right it's like yeah you know it's like

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
we need lots of manpower to do these

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,720
back protein compute 515 so

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,680
yeah we're gonna put it behind the

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,279
commercial

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,760
customers so you know they pay for

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,839
itself

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,360
and fair enough i mean sure there's lots

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,080
of work to do

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,560
uh but protein stuff and whatnot but i

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,200
mean

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,920
they're still releasing 512 right so

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,399
that that

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,160
argument i don't know it doesn't work a

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,959
lot because like if

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,720
why do you still release 512 as an open

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,720
source product but not 515

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,320
that's their decision there's not much

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,079
we can do about it right uh

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,360
they are their own entity and they will

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,320
do whatever they think is better for

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
them

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,600
uh so yeah the first release

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,000
the first commercial release of kid 515

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,320
was was in march this year

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,399
one month earlier than the last five

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:30,240
dollars

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,240
so do we need as kbe long-term support

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,000
personally i think we don't in the most

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,720
of the cases right until until now

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,920
we have not had been using neither five

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,560
six or five nine

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,200
or five twelve extensively right both

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,000
but

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,120
most of our distribution channels be

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
like either like

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,440
links distributions or pc distributions

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,920
or those kind of

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,240
big monsters that release our software

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,880
together with a million more things

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,480
they've always basically been either on

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,720
the last version if it's a rolling

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,680
release kind of thing or on the cube

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,079
version that was

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,920
released when they did a version right

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,160
so like if you had fedora 31

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,040
so what well whatever the one had the

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,320
cube that was

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,959
late released when they were one right

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,640
no there were not really many use cases

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,320
for for the lts and for things we

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,560
released ourselves like the app images

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,959
or the windows binaries and stuff we

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,920
mostly always went to the last cube too

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,320
right so

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,160
there's we didn't really use the

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,839
long-term support of good

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,399
much but cute fighter thing is a special

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,160
case right

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,240
it's the same that happened with q4 q6

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
has been released and there's been six

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,200
zero and six one and six two

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,720
is almost around the corner

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:52,000
and now maybe with q six two

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,720
we could start using it but it's gonna

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,519
be a while

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,120
until until we do right if you've been

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,399
uh during the week attending the

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,760
frameworks uh

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,040
talks or buffs it's it's not gonna

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,120
happen overnight right

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,160
so we are going to to be using q515 for

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,680
a while

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,680
so but we we did the best thing we could

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,240
given that the kid company didn't want

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,560
to keep a uh

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,800
uh an open celebration of fifa 15 which

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,079
is creating our patch collection right

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,200
we don't need a patch collection it it

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,200
might have just been

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,720
the distress doing patches right this

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,959
this happens uh

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,639
relatively often that for unreleased

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,839
software distress keep

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,480
patches on top of the the release

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,560
software but that's

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,920
just so terrible like you you go and

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,000
check the patches that

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,200
one destroys ships against one package

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,720
and then

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,160
that hasn't been released maybe for like

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,200
10 years and go to another distro and

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
they have different patches and i was

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,959
like

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,399
that's not good so we try to to make

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,560
that that boom happen

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,000
uh and centralize everything in one

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,680
place right so that's what the patch

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,399
collection is

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,839
so what do you mean by patch connection

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,600
it's a weird name uh well it's actually

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,079
not a patch collection it's just a

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,800
git repositories right so they are

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,920
hosted

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,079
in invent which is our gitlab

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,480
uh that that thing over there uh

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,480
invented

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,600
uh has like i don't know uh 20 or more

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,200
repositories inside which is

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,800
all the cute repositories right it's

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
about it's basically a mirror of those

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,519
repositories it gets updated

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,360
every three hours i think last time i i

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,639
talked with this admin

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,079
and on top of the middle ring uh we have

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,480
our own branch right so

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,560
each of those repositories has a kb

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,240
slash 515 branch

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,680
which is where we put our things uh that

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,959
branch was created

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,760
on the latest comment available for the

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,320
515 branch

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,120
which is good because uh so that's past

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,079
uh 5

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,600
15 12 right there there are a few more

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,680
comments there than the la

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,959
sorry 5 15 2. there's a few more

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,440
comments there than

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,959
there are in the latest available

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,600
terminal

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,440
uh we have to assume those are nice book

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,959
fixes that the kid people wanted to have

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,519
released so that's why we started from

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,519
there

00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,519
unfortunately

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,839
some of the repos had changed version

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,680
already

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,800
and some haven't so some of the good

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,839
rappers started calling themselves 553

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,000
and some others still didn't so

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,199
it's not super awesome if you compile

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,880
everything from there

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,880
but life is tough

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,120
so as you can see it's not really a

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,279
patch collection it's just

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,320
git commits right i mean good comments

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,360
are patches but

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,160
yeah just they're actually good comments

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,600
right so

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,680
in that kde 515 branch uh

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,279
well branches i got one for each

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,720
repository

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,600
we have comments that fix at least

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,839
one of the issues which is either

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,199
security issues right so like

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,000
there's a huge

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,519
issue with the png handler and when you

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
load the png it will delete

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,880
all your files right i mean that hasn't

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,560
happened and it

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,240
probably won't happen but that would be

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,000
one of the cases that

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:29,680
could happen uh or crashes like when i i

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,040
know connect to a website that uses ssl

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,759
blah blah blah it crashes so we would

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,920
fix that or i mean more generic

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,279
functional defects like

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,360
i don't there's something wrong with

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,040
cupid's button and

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,880
i mean that's that's kind of strange

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,959
because cute is very well tested and

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,639
very well used so

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,040
it would be much more of an edge case

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,920
right if that happens but

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,120
we just covered our bases right all

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,279
right

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,800
so giving your description you could let

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,240
the description i just gave you could

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,839
say well

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,440
you did the fork right you call it a

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,639
form don't call it a patch collection

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,920
which is like nobody knows what the

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
batch collection is people know what a

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,639
fork is

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,120
but the thing is it's we don't think

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,680
it's a fork we

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,480
don't have new features right so it's

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,519
only

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:23,040
uh bug fixes uh in the broad

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:25,680
term of of a bug fix and on top of that

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,480
we require every patch that we're

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,600
merging

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,600
to our branch to have it been first

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,519
merged or released or developed or

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,279
committed

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,800
in the cute dead branch right they keep

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,399
the branch

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,399
is where the q-6 development is

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,360
happening

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,120
and that makes lots of sense because

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,800
eventually we're going to go to q6 right

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,199
as we mentioned it's going to be

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,079
this year or next year or the other but

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,000
we will

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,880
use cute seats at some point and

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,079
all the fixes we have for 515 we

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,519
obviously

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,680
want them to also be in q6 so

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,600
just just do that let's put them in kid6

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,839
and then we just cherry pick them

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,919
into our branch and everyone's happy

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,079
right

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,600
of course there's a star there in in

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,959
every right so it's every star

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,319
patch we already actually have at least

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,240
one patch that

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,959
is not upstream and that's because

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,679
the file disappeared right so that file

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,640
doesn't exist anymore on q6 so obviously

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,520
there's no reason for for that fix to be

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,000
in q6

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,799
so well i mean we're not gonna give

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,320
ourselves

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:41,440
some rules that are uh so

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,360
so i mean strong that

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,720
prevent us from actually fixing what we

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,480
want right so

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,559
the guideline is if we

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,760
backboard the patch it has to be a back

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,520
part right so it has to come from q6

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,679
but if there is a really really really

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,120
really really good reason for that patch

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,360
not to be in q6 like

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,880
the class doesn't exist anymore but then

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,799
we all

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,720
we will accept the patch potentially

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,440
right

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,799
uh we have a free software focus in this

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,799
in this patch collection

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,559
or non-fork as i call it sometimes

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,799
if you come to us and say you know

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,440
there's this comment in get six that

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,160
makes it

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,960
not crash in qnx or integrity it's like

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,559
yeah i know congratulations you can

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,919
carry this patch yourself right it's

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,440
like

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,760
there is no free software in in qnx

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,760
that i know of or if there is it's it's

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,440
very limited and we don't have

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,960
uh access to hearings or whatever so

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,120
it's like yeah

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,480
free software focus right which it makes

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,320
sense

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,760
so who who decides what goes in and what

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,520
doesn't go in right

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,440
so it's created by a small group of

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,400
people at the moment

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,039
i think it's eight people or seven

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,440
people

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,320
counting myself so it's not very big but

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,360
it's reasonable

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,520
right so we can each other

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,400
make sure that we're not making mistakes

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,760
when

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,760
uh cherry picking patches and whatnot uh

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,160
that group of people is the intersection

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,799
of

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,440
people that are kd developers and cute

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,400
approvers

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,600
so it's it's people that know both

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,240
worlds

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,600
like the frees of work world and the kd

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,600
and the cute world

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,170
which is also free software but more

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,240
narrow than cute

00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,200
[Applause]

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,039
better so we thought that was a good

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
starting point right

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,720
obviously that doesn't mean that if

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,760
you're a free software developer

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,120
that is doing cute software outside of

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,280
kde

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,640
uh and you're a kid approver or maybe

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,039
not a kid approver but

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,160
you can prove to us that you know you

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,120
very well

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,919
and you want to join helping us talk to

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,240
us i mean

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,320
this is not a a very select club right

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,840
it's just the club that we tried to make

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:04,240
uh big enough that it would work

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,240
but we're happy to have more people on

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,200
board

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,679
okay so now you've told me what it is

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,480
and

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
it sounds like a good idea right as a

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,360
user i

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,360
want the fixes right that's what users

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,280
want i mean they sometimes also want

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,120
features shiny new features are good for

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,240
users but they also want

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,679
fixes so how do i get those fixes

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
that's yeah that's a bit of the hard

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,520
part right now uh

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,840
we're not making releases and i know

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,520
this is not very

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,840
this is a bit controversial sometimes

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,320
but we decided not to make research

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,919
because

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,000
we how do you make a release right so

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,600
the cute company has released something

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,640
they called

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,559
5 15 3.

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,320
we could also make a release and call it

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,159
553 but that

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,679
would be the most confusing thing ever

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,000
right so we

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,039
should not do that uh so we could call

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,640
it five fifteen

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:05,520
two dot random number

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,679
or dot kde.1 that might work but

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,720
when do we make the releases like we

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,760
just

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,760
get patches into our git repo as we see

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,200
the problems being an issue right so we

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,320
see an issue it's like oh this needs

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
fixed and we put it so

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,679
would we do a release every day or every

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,799
time we do a commit

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,640
i don't know we we went for the uh

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,200
decision of not making releases

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,480
obviously as everything can be changed

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,480
there was a recent discussion on the

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,240
release team about this but

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,280
it didn't it kind of bite a little

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,240
so as a user you can kind of manually

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,200
compile it from git

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,919
this is terrible it will take forever uh

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,799
once you start

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,360
compiling web engine but that's that's

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,240
one way

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,120
uh if you're a developer we switched

00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,159
skds build to use it

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,200
i think last week so

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,000
you will get it uh probably if you're

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,159
using uh

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,679
flat pack app uh the flat background

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,120
time is built

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,320
from from the cute the the the non-fork

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,400
we have of cube

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,480
so every flat pack app is fine

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,559
i know it's used in some distrust to be

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,679
honest i i i must apologize here because

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,559
i didn't do as much

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,320
research as i should have i know uh art

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,200
linux uses it uh

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,679
i'm almost here and two uses it i saw a

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,400
patch

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,840
yesterday in for opensuse to start using

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,200
it

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,200
i think it said use the kde patch

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,640
collection i know i don't know

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,320
to which i mean opensuse is a bit

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,679
confusing to me sometimes because it has

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,440
lots of

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,799
releases going on so i don't know to

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,360
which of the reasons it applies but

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,480
there is

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,960
some work going on there so i think as a

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,400
user

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,480
you should talk to your distro and ask

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,840
if they're using it and as a distro you

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,400
should talk to us if you don't and

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,120
explain your your pain points i i do

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,200
acknowledge

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,240
that the not release part is a pain

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,840
point so

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,520
let's try to have a better conversation

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,559
there if it's if it's really blocking

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,240
you

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,880
but i think it's a good idea to people

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,880
start using it

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,200
so if you're a developer how can you

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,039
help right so

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,679
we're we're kind of lucky here in the

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,679
sense that

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,760
the q development workflow changed

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,080
recently

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,200
and they decided that everything is

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,120
going to go

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,120
to the development branch and then fixes

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,360
that like comments that are actually

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,720
fixes will be

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,880
cherry picked by port to the branches

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,279
that need fixing right so if you fix

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,080
something nowadays in depth you would

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,480
mark it with

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,919
okay this is this six is a back please

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,600
backpart it to

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,000
six to maybe six one and

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,919
five fifteen right which is great

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,559
because then we can just go to the

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,279
commit log and see everything that has

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:05,200
been marked

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:08,720
as this needs to be cherry picked to 515

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,600
so i wrote like 10 lines of terrible

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,840
script

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,799
and and brought the bot but not about

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,600
script that i

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,400
run like every day every two days that

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,760
just

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,159
creates a an issue in in this url saying

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,120
okay

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,760
i found the comment that is marked as it

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,880
should be the

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,760
backboard 2515 maybe we could have a

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,400
look right

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,600
one thing we decided to do is to not

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,760
backport everything

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,400
blindly right i mean we could have done

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,400
it that

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,799
it's probably not the best of ideas

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,440
right because i mean

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,640
the fact that someone made a commit

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,000
against debt and said

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,440
yeah this needs to be port to 515

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,080
doesn't mean that

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,799
a it will actually apply one to one

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,480
right it

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,000
happens often that you need to do small

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,559
changes because the code has changed

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,080
from

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,240
from 6 to 15 and b i mean

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,919
it doesn't mean that it might not break

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,080
something in 15 and

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,080
and since we don't see everything that

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,520
goes on on the 515 branch they might

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,760
have had a comment that just went

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,799
directly there and we didn't see it

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,919
so yeah we used that part the things

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,120
that we

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,679
see that make sense i mean we backported

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
a lot of

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,120
wayland things because wayland is one of

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,120
the things we're working and and it's

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,799
slowly improving right so

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,440
we've got part of the thoughts of those

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,760
move backwards also

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,200
i mean one of the things we first really

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,720
realized we needed this for

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,600
is uh gcc 11 was released

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,000
and it changed a bit the includes for

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,279
the standard library like for the

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,080
standard library to be better

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,120
actually right so they include between

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,360
themselves a bit

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,360
less but that means that some of the

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,320
cute codes stop compiling right because

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,559
it's hard to figure out all the includes

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,880
you need you basically just

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,640
compile and if it's compiled like cool

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,840
this is not right it's it's

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,320
that works but with gc11 there was some

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,600
i think it was limits include that is

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,520
not included anymore

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,640
while including i don't know std vector

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,120
or whatever

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,200
so qt stopped compiling so what we

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,919
definitely needed that right we needed a

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,000
way to

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,960
have a cube 515 that would compile with

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,360
gc11

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,279
so that was one of the very important

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,279
things we decided to upload obviously

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,799
so a bit of of the future

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,559
kde will move to q6

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:40,720
at some point right as i mentioned

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,600
probably not this year maybe at the end

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,600
of the year who knows

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,279
most probably next year right

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:54,400
that means that obviously our focus on

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:57,120
maintaining a 5 15 budget will decrease

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,720
a little not totally because obviously

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,559
distributions are gonna

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,799
keep shipping plasma 5 for a while right

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,440
so we will still

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,320
maintain to some degree the the 515

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,919
budget for

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,880
for very important issues obviously

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,240
right if you imagine that gc12 comes out

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,000
and we have the same problems and things

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,960
that compile obviously we will fix that

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,840
right but

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,960
it i mean i think it makes sense that as

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,880
we move

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,480
more towards q6 we will put less effort

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,480
on this budget collection

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,080
so 5 15 3 was released on march as i

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,200
mentioned

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,960
will we get this as open source

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,279
at all i don't know i mean there's this

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,679
clause about

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,880
cute having to release the things 12

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,159
months later and

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,440
they they'd release them but i'm not a

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,039
lawyer i don't know if that actually

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,120
applies or since they already released

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,399
q6 they are very covered by that

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,840
uh we will see and what will happen if

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,520
they actually release it right if they

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,919
actually release it

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,360
it's gonna be a kind of a pain for it i

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,200
mean it's gonna be good right i mean if

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,919
we want them to release it don't get me

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,720
wrong

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,120
because it will obviously have uh fixes

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,000
and

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,080
and we want those but if they release it

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,440
as a turbo

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,640
how do we mix that with the big bug

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,640
fixes we already have

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,679
or not so i mean cute company people if

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,880
you're listening

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,720
please do release 553 153 as

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,039
open source and please do release it as

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,520
a grid repo so we can just

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,240
rebase merge whatever which will make

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,960
our life

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,960
so much easier

00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,919
so cute is

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,640
releasing six too soon-ish i don't

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,360
remember but

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,440
in a few months and it's gonna be lts

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,159
again only commercially right so

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,919
are we gonna have a 6-2 kde patch

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,240
collection

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,080
i don't know i mean i don't have a uh i

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,000
can see the future

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,640
but as i mentioned before

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,399
there hasn't been much use for for

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,520
intraversion of these

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,279
releases in in kde so my

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,440
if you made me bad right now my bet

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,240
would be that we wouldn't have we will

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,799
not have

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,960
a 6-2 patch collection but who knows

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,360
right i mean

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,159
the the future might be interesting in

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,200
this regard

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,159
okay so this was the end of my talk uh

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,760
i want you to ask yourself these four

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,039
questions and i could actually give you

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,039
my answers

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,320
uh so in case you were not paying

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,520
attention you can get

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,320
four quick overviews of what it was

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
about

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,840
so who's doing this it's it's us it's

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,279
kde right

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,159
when are we doing it we're doing it

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,480
right now how we're doing it in event

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,799
there's some branches that we cherry

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,480
pick comments from the kids company

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,480
uh one of the queen company the kids

00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,600
upstream committers so so we get the

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,279
fixes we need

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,240
why well because i mean we need it right

00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,120
we're gonna get we're gonna be stuck for

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,120
the good

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,880
for the good definition of stuck with

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,279
q515 for a while

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,960
so we need to make sure that q515 stays

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,080
in good shape right so

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,919
that's that's it now i think i have some

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,159
time for questions so if there are

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,480
questions i will try to answer them as

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,320
best as i can

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,399
yes thank you very much albert we indeed

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,600
have time for questions and we do have

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,399
questions

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,360
so um starting with one from jonathan

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,880
riddle

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,760
will they cute 5.5

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,840
point x commercial releases be open

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,200
source at all or does the

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,760
kde free qt agreement not require that

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,679
right so that i i mentioned that in my

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,000
minus one slide i'm

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,200
i'm not sure i we have to look at that

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,159
more carefully

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,600
because as i mentioned there's i mean

00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,799
there's lots of legalese around it and

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,799
it says there has to be

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,799
a continued development of cute blah

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,880
blah blah but that q6 is

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,880
continued development of cube right so

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,600
if that applies to

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,440
all the releases and on only some of the

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,080
releases i'm i'm not sure

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,159
i should know better because i i am part

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,519
of the cute free

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,480
foundation now but uh yeah i don't have

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,240
an answer for that

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,600
i mean okay but yeah we have to look

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,720
into it

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,760
okay next question also from jonathan is

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,840
the cute api has been bumped

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,880
to 5 15 free are there plans for

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,000
when to bump it again right so uh that's

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,120
the thing i mentioned

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,720
two we didn't ban the api that abi was

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,279
bumped for us right we

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,440
we started on the top of uh the qt 515

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,279
branches and the yeah the api

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,600
number had already been changed it's not

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,600
us that has decided to change anything

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,120
so we are not going to change anything

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,480
because we didn't change this thing so

00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,720
it's going to be stay there

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,640
forever unless we get uh releases from

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,320
cute and we put ourselves on top and

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,440
then it will be changed but we're

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,840
not gonna change that okay thanks and

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,840
the

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,440
final question i see here is from

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,080
xinjiang and i'm sending

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,240
a link that was part of the question in

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,159
our chat here

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,399
have you heard about this patch set

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,679
probably originating from telegram

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:29,519
and it seems to be a part set to q2 okay

00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:32,480
we have not seen that

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,679
yep uh yeah i just clicked the link i

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,679
had not seen that before

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,600
i'm not sure if i should be looking at

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,799
this because if those patches are not

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,240
contributed uh upstream to cube that

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,640
always creates

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,600
weird licensing while we're licensing

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,000
issues so i've closed

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,200
the the bats now uh but yeah i mean we

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,600
should have uh

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,720
maybe go talk to them and say hey work

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,279
with us

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,519
because as i mentioned before it's

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,679
always a silly idea to do the same thing

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,120
twice right i mean if you can't have

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,440
if you can do it once why would you do

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,399
it twice right so it doesn't make any

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,480
sense for us to be keeping a pad set and

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,039
for the telegram people if this is the

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,679
telegram people keeping a budget right

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,679
just let's keep one and everything will

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,200
be everyone will be happier

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,679
of course those all of the questions

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,360

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,159

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,600

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,840
