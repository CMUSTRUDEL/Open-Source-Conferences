so

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,440
hey this is kyogre bolik from ambition

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,200
i'm standing in front of the

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
mercedes-benz museum in stuttgart in the

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,239
turkham germany

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,920
here is where you can have a look at the

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,280
history of materials spends going all

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,239
the way back to the first ever

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,039
automobile

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
the benz patent motorwagen we sure have

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,079
come a long way since then

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,000
what you can't see in a museum yet

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
however is what we're working on at

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
ambition the next generation

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,359
infotainment for mercedes-benz passenger

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
vehicles

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,440
as a 100 subsidiary of mercedes-benz

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,920
algae based in berlin

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,960
with just over 400 people from more than

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,680
40 nations

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,760
we're part of daimler's mbos strategy

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,600
and a developing ambient a reusable

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,720
platform for automotive in vehicle

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,640
infotainment

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,000
a key ingredient of ambient is free and

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,400
open source software

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,840
whenever we're faced with a challenge we

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,119
want to ask ourselves

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,960
can whalen do it can pipewire do it or a

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,759
catchphrase you're all familiar with

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,200
is there a framework for that in fact

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,720
cars these days are pretty much

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,479
computers from wheels

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,079
what drives the gorgeous mbox

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,520
hyperscreen in the all-new electric

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,280
mercedes eqs

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,680
isn't too far from a regular desktop

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,880
linux we have systemd units to bring the

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,680
system up we use

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,360
qt qmlc plus plus for the ui just like

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,680
headers

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,360
and just like a linux distribution what

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,439
are products to be software driven

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,200
not hardware driven and get the latest

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,200
and greatest software to customers on

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
whichever car line is unveiled next

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
or even retrofitted to cars on the road

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,399
through over-the-air updates

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,000
for many years to come we're proud to

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,520
sponsor academy again this year and

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
recently we actually switched our

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,680
default desktop tools for our linux

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
developer machines to kde plasma

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,000
this is not only because of our close

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,840
proximity to the kde community

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,360
but also as an incentive for us to

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,120
improve the user experience for

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
ourselves and everyone else

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,400
we're looking forward to using more

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,840
frameworks and pieces of plasma in the

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,440
infotainment system

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
and if you want to learn more about what

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,480
we're up to and how you can become a

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,160

sponsor talk this year we're thrilled to

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,280
be a platinum sponsor

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,560
at academy for those of you who don't

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,199
already know me

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,759
my name is nurizi sanchez and i am the

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,280
senior

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,280
open source program manager at get lab

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,560
that means that i work with communities

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
like kde

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,759
and advocate on their behalf to help

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,680
make gitlab

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,440
a better place for open source

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,000
communities and projects

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
to thrive

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,000
today i'm going to be talking about a

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,840
few different things

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,280
but first i'll start off with an intro

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,600
to gitlab

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,880
i'll talk about how we can all make

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,319
greater contribution

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,479
impact and i'll mention how you can join

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,479
us

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,840
let's get started with a quick

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
introduction to gitlab

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,440
gitlab is a single platform for the

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,759
entire team

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,080
this means that everybody can use gitlab

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,800
instead of having different tools for

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,560
different

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,919
stages you can consolidate and just have

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,560
a single platform at gitlab we've

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,280
identified stages like manage plan

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,240
create

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,440
verify package secure release configure

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,759
and defend

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,720
those are a whole lot of stages and a

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,599
whole lot of people

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,319
need to be involved in deploying great

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,720
quality

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,599
enterprise software so instead of

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,160
needing to have

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,360
a single tool for everything and thus

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,840
making it really difficult

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,199
also for contributors having to learn

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,440
new tools new systems etc and having to

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,560
maintain all of those tools you can just

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,440
use gitlab

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
to make your life simple and make it

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,120
easier for

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,120
newcomers to join

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,400
we believe that gitlab's all-in-one

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,520
devops

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,639
platform enables greater visibility

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,280
because everyone can see the work that

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,759
in turn

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,080
leads to greater collaboration because

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,800
everyone can contribute

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,319
that leads to more velocity because

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,599
everyone can deliver

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,720
more predictable results faster

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,120
and all of that combined leads to

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,160
leads projects to be able to iterate

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
faster

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,680
and innovate together

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,720
and at gitlab we're all about

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,680
contributing together

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,039
in fact it's get lab's mission to change

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,159
all creative work

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,680
from read only to read write so that

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,560
everyone can contribute we believe

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,880
that when everyone can contribute

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,039
consumers become contributors

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,000
and we greatly increase the rate of

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,000
human progress

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,600
all right so i've gone over what gitlab

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,399
is

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
and what it stands for so let's talk

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,600
about

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,000
how we can all make greater contribution

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,080
impact

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,040
and in order to do that we need to talk

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,640
about the term

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,399
upstreaming because now i know

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,160
a lot of you are familiar with the term

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,959
because kde

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,160
is a popular upstream for many projects

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,040
and it also

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,560
contributes upstream to other projects

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,440
but in this case

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,320
gitlab is the upstream version of the

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
kde

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
instance that you all are using to

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,839
contribute to kde

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,680
so that means that as you're

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,519
contributing to kde

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,880
if you're having difficulty using the

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,640
gitlab instance

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,080
or just have an idea for how to make it

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,440
better you can

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,080
contribute upstream so that it's easier

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,680
for everybody that's using gitlab to

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,880
benefit from the work that you

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,880
do to solve that

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
and there are different contributions

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,360
that you can make up stream

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,040
the first that i'll talk about is code

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,519
contributions

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,480
and that not only reduces the need to

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,360
maintain

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,720
the downstream kde instance but as i

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,279
mentioned before

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,480
the work that you do to customize the

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,200
kde version

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,680
or whatever it is can also benefit many

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
other

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,760
projects in case you're interested

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,279
git lab is mainly based on ruby on rails

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,160
and go

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,360
but you can jump in and contribute with

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,440
lots of other skills

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,959
or without other knowledge of other

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,720
program languages

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:30,000
so things like javascript view haml html

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,560
shell css and kubernetes

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
we have a contribution guide that shows

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,360
you

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,560
which program languages correspond to

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,560
which projects

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,560
so it makes it easy to jump right in

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,079
regardless of the programming language

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,079
that you feel more comfortable most

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:50,160
comfortable contributing in

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,240
also highly value non-code contributions

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,760
and i want to emphasize that you do not

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,519
need to be a developer

00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,560
to contribute upstream to gitlab

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,560
a comment an issue a merge request these

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,079
are all ways of contributing

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,000
and that means that even submitting an

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,720
idea is

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,519
a contribution so whether you're a

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,760
designer

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
or you're into marketing docs

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,600
translations

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,480
whatever it is there is a way for you to

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,800
get involved

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,480
and to make a big difference and our

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,279
contribution guide again

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
shows specific ways that you can uh

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,200
contribute to gitlab

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:32,560
in a non-engineering way

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,800
at gitlab because we're an open core

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,399
company that maintains git lab the open

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,720
source project

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,519
we've adopted the open source mentality

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
throughout

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,000
the entire company that means that

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,760
gitlab works alongside

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,720
our community to deliver gitlab

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,360
we've created handbook pages that

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,480
outline

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,320
and detail which stages there are and

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
which team members are specifically

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
working on those stages

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,240
so here on this screenshot on the right

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,480
i showed the project management group

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,480
and you can see the product manager the

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,440
engineering team the support team the

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,160
docs team

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
the design team everybody who's involved

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,000
in

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,279
making that stage that makes it easier

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,240
for you to tag

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,480
those team members on gitlab issues or

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,560
in

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,720
merge requests and have discussions or

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,839
work alongside those team members to

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,800
help your

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,560
get your contributions in or to you know

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,279
find out more about contributing

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,200
in those areas and that cuts out the

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,079
middle person who may be advocating on

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,160
your behalf

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,680
because you're able to discuss directly

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,000
with the people who have

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,519
the most relevant technical expertise

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,440
but if you need some extra help feel

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,800
free to tag either myself

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,720
at noritzi or my open source

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,279
support liaison greg meyers he's at greg

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,880
to help and hopefully our usernames are

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,279
simple enough to remember

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,279
let's see

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,120
all right so now i'm going to briefly go

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,160
over how

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,160
you can join us

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,279
and the first way is by joining the get

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,600
lab for open source program

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,360
now i know that kde is already using git

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,680
lab they're actually using the community

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,160
edition which is our completely open

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,600
source

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,920
version but if you find yourself

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,760
at another community or with one of your

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,800
own personal projects

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,519
needing to use our top tiers top tier

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,560
features

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,680
or if you need some extra ci minutes

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,560
we offer 50 000 ci minutes per month

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,800
for free through this program so it's a

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,959
great way to

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,160
get some extra perks so feel free to

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,839
apply and if you need help navigating it

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,399
message me because this is the program

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,399
that i run

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,440
i also want to mention the get lab

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,560
beyond code event series

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,680
this event series came from an idea

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,040
that the that some women in the women

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,199
get lab team member resource group had

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,199
where they were expressing interest in

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,240
speaking at more community events

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,120
but also uh expressed the the

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,240
fact that they are not engineers and

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,959
that a lot of our

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,279
uh conferences and events and everything

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,000
tend to be very engineering focused

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,800
so we wanted to combine kind of two

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,519
goals

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,639
one allow these women um who didn't have

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,079
another place to

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,800
really you know fit um in our events

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,120
to be able to speak at our events and

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,680
then

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,040
also to really showcase how gitlab can

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,000
be used for things

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,480
beyond code so when you attend these

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,399
events

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,000
you'll hear from people in finance

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,120
accounting legal

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,800
marketing design community operations a

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,199
whole bunch of different teams

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,320
that use gitlab in their day-to-day work

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,519
and you'll hear

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,920
hacks tricks just see the different ways

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,480
that gitlab can be used to

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,160
manage all of those workflows so it's a

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,000
great event series to

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,199
attend especially if you're not yet

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
using gitlab

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,920
for things beyond engineering activities

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
and want to get some ideas for how to

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,279
get involved

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,760
maybe how to get buy-in from those teams

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,760
as well

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,279
we also have our annual user conference

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,880
coming up august 3rd to 4th

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,480
that's get lab commit and katie will be

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,800
having a presence there

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,079
so i hope to see a lot of y'all's

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,120
beautiful faces

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:42,160
there as well you're not quite sure how

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,639
to get started

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,600
or you know you're a little shy or just

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,480
want to

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
experience how the contribution workflow

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,720
works

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,279
uh a quarterly hackathon is a great

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,240
event

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,800
to try out because there are merge

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,759
request coaches there to help you

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,680
and there are some pretty cool swag

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,680
giveaways that we do as well

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,440
so it's kind of a win-win-win situation

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,600
i will say that the one that we had this

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,839
quarter just happened earlier this month

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,839
so the next one will be next quarter

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,839
we would love to hear from you so please

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,720
get in touch

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,639
we have a user forum a community forum

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,800
that's

00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,160
forum.gitlab.com and this is where if

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,320
you have technical

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,839
troubleshooting needs or just want to

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,000
get to know some more of the community

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,120
members or get lab team

and i will see you around academy

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,600
hi i'm grayson the host and producer of

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,320
the fedora podcast

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,880
with me today are rex dieter and neil

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,000
gompa

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,360
of the kde sig hi y'all hey

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
hi today we're going to talk about

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,960
fedora

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,600
and kde my first question for you guys

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,840
is

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,840
what is the fedora project

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,200
i can feel that one um i'd say fedora is

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,640
a great

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,679
community of folks

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,039
that helps create some innovative uh

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,919
notably free and open source platforms

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,720
that's open-ended but the primary target

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,760
is

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,760
linux distribution what is fedora kde

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,480
first and foremost it's a fedora special

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,960
interest group

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,360
it's a group of like-minded individuals

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,559
that like to work on kde

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,000
and the primary product of our work

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:43,200
is a spin that users can use to install

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,240
fedora and kde plasma on their computers

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,840
how is fedora kde involved in upstream

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,520
kde

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,520
i'll field that one because it's a it's

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,720
a fun question and i like this one

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:58,240
um so a lot of what we do

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,080
in fedor kde is take the upstream

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,720
software and integrate it into

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,200
fedora itself so we provide we package

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,200
up the

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,280
kde technologies and ship it as part of

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,919
our spin as rex mentioned earlier

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,080
and we use the experience that we gain

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,039
from doing that work to provide valuable

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,360
feedback

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,120
to the kde community to help improve

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,280
their software and their processes and

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,720
make a better experience for everyone

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,080
we don't want to keep this to ourselves

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,440
we don't want to make like some kind of

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,000
secret sauce

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,960
whatever we're we want to work with the

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,440
upstream

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,720
to help make the kde community

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,880
successful

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,120
with the help of the fedora community as

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,120
well

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,799
what is it that makes fedora a great

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,799
choice to use kde

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,919
a great question and i'm going to borrow

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,120
some words of a

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,320
a nice fellow that joined our group

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,120
recently

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,080
he shared uh some good bullet points

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,200
here

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,720
notably uh fedor produces high quality

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,520
packaging

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,840
and that uh fedora's package management

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,480
is

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:10,320
well done uh fedor is great at

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:14,480
adopting new technologies

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,520
fedor also makes some good choices for

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,400
default

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,280
default settings and some pre-installed

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:25,120
software that our users can use

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:28,240
and most importantly

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,520
we have a group of responsive and

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,880
friendly developers that's

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,120
super important what's coming up next

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,480
for kde in fedora

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,799
all right so i'm taking this one this

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,919
one's fun uh so

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,600
as some of y'all may already know uh

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,799
with fedora linux 34

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,440
we lo we switched uh the kd desktop in

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,559
fedora

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,799
kd plasma desktop to platinum weyland

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,720
and so now we offer the weyland session

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,159
by default and we did a lot of work with

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,240
the kd community

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,559
during that bring up time over the past

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,960
uh year to make that a reality

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,960
it was fantastic we went back and forth

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,240
with like various bugs and and user

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,640
experience niggles and we

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,280
we came out with a solid experience in

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,960
the end

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,720
and we want to take that further we want

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
to refine that because

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,559
you know the work is never done and you

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,720
know that was a big change that we made

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,280
for fedora linux 34 and so fedora linux

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,200
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,559
and further we want to keep improving on

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,120
that we want to iterate and make that

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,880
better

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,480
but we're not exactly stopping there we

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,200
have another thing coming

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,480
so launching with fedora linux 35 is

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,480
fedora kenoit or

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,840
fedora canoatay uh this is a new

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,840
desktop spin produced by the kde

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,600
sig that uses rpm os tree which is a

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,320
technology that comes from the fedora

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,919
core os

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,799
group to build a reliable

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,640
immutable desktop platform using kde

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,240
technologies built on fedora

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,320
we've done a bunch of work with the kde

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,919
community to

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,679
develop the first bits of integration

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,480
around that in plasma discover

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,520
and that's shipped with plasma 522 we're

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,960
going to start using that

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,799
integrate that and provide further

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,320
feedback refinement

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,600
and hope to ship an awesome desktop

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,760
experience

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,760
uh in fedor linux 35

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,360
how can people get fedora kde

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,799
yeah so this is really deep it's just

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,240
single plate kde.fedoraproject.org i

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,200
know

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,600
you go there you'll see a lovely splash

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,159
uh

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,679
with a screenshot of our desktop

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,799
environment then you've got a big button

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,720
to download it

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,120
from there you can find the standard

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,360
64-bit x86 pc

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,159
iso to download and install on your

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,679
regular

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:53,679
x86 pcs but also you'll find links

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,880
for 64-bit arm otherwise known as either

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,960
arm v8 or

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,960
as people in the fedora community i'll

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,360
call it arch 64.

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,039
or you'll find 32-bit arm otherwise

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,200
known as arm v7

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,080
variants of it for single board

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,799
computers

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,320
and arm-based laptops such as the

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,880
raspberry pi

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,400
and the pine book pro respectively so if

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
you want to try it on all the different

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,840
things

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,640
it's easy just go to

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,640
kd.fedoraproject.org and go check it out

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,159
how can people talk to the sick get

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,440
involved and contribute

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:33,440
so this is

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,840
so easy we now have a matrix room

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,280
where we can all talk really easily so

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,640
if you want to come and reach out to us

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,760
and talk to us give us real time

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,039
feedback or

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,520
you know kind of figure out how to get

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,559
started you can reach out to us at

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,600
pound fedora kde colonmatrix.org that's

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,039
our matrix room

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,799
how soon we'll be launching our own

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,960
fedora matrix server and the

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,360
room name will change but if you're in

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,039
there it'll it'll be available and

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,360
when the room name changes you'll be

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,080
coming along right along for the ride

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,799
uh and the old name i expect will still

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,520
work

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,640
um but if real time chat's not your back

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,080
and you'd prefer to you know

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,480
