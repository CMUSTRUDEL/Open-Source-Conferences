you're having a good time at academy uh

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
you know there are always great talks at

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,559
academy

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,840
and i look forward every year to going

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,719
open souza is uh very excited to

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,160
be a sponsor of this year's academy you

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,920
know once again

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,360
opensuse has a long tradition of

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,559
sponsoring academy

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,160
and we have a lot of people involved in

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,600
both projects

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,280
who participate with uh one another

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,960
and help to make open source better

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,159
so a few things uh i wanted to mention

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,280
um about uh the open souza project

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,400
and um one might be uh the fact that

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,640
this weekend

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
we are also having our conference uh

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,000
this was

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
sort of unplanned where uh where the

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
dates aligned with one another

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,320
but either way there's there's great

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,439
talks at both conferences so

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,280
uh i hope to see you at uh

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,200
the open souza conference and i hope to

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,280
drop into academy occasionally

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,280
um as i'll be running that but

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,119
a little bit of news about the open

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,640
souza project recently we

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,560
announced uh and and released uh

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,880
leap 15.3 uh big news about leap 15.3 is

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,159
that

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,439
it is fully um compatible

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:55,520
with uh linux enterprise so those

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,880
developers those um those hackers those

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,360
you know people in the in the industry

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,320
who are looking to um

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,320
to have an option to be able to upgrade

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,000
to an enterprise product if they need to

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,160
uh can look at uh opensuse elite 15.3

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,959
uh it is uh it is uh

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,520

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,760
planned

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,959
um there is uh progress that's already

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,280
been started on 15.4

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,239
and so you know there could very well be

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,680
a 15.5

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,599
at least that's where things are looking

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,800
right now

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,040
but you know this is a

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,360

broader open source linux community i

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,040
believe supporting each other in this

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,639
way

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,400

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,120
collaboratively

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,040
could have a positive impact and a

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
really large effect on real people's

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,600
lives

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,199
not just techies and developers and

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,759
people who want to code

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,360

kind of thing that i

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,759

large and growing and the abundant

community is large and growing

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,960

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,080
together i'm sure there are people in

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,440
the abundant community

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,360
who would love to learn more about

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,039
for letting me speak here and it's our

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,960
pleasure to help

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,960
to sponsor this event thank you

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,039
hello academy my name is freddie clardon

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,440
i'm a principal unit lead at remarkable

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,479
and yeah this year remarkable is

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,599
sponsoring academy

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,560
what is remarkably ask

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,400
our vision is better thinking through

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,400
technology

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,160
but that may be slightly abstract and we

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,120
need to start somewhere

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,199
so what we actually do is we create

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,560
embedded devices

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,599
looking like this and

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,960
it's digital paper

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:44,160
it's an embedded device and

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,720
it's there to let you do note taking a

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,520
bit

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,319
hard to do in front of the camera uh i

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,599
can draw

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,639
i can make annotations

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,199
and the whole um

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,319
setup is so that i can get my notes

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,919
synced to

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,919
my pc on my mobile

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,319
we really love great design we really

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,759
aim for simplicity

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,160
avoid all distractions and

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,319
bring all the good things about paper to

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,759
the digital world

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,960
um yeah everybody wants to grab your

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,199
attention these days

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,400
there's youtube facebook and all these

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,319
other services

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,520
and we take a different approach we want

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,280
to actually

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,280
enable you to focus and to think

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,719
we have really exciting technology

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,279
challenges

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,479
we built linux devices and the whole

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,680
thing from

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,800
hardware design to the software

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,080
happens here in norway

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,080
we have challenges that are really cool

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,440
and unique so for example we have the

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,160
e-ink display

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,080
which has its properties we of course

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,320
want to make a really great experience

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,440
for the user that you feel like you're

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,000
writing on paper

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,519
we need to draw fast enough because well

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,120
if the line appears several seconds

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,040
later that wouldn't be fun

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,279
to use we

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,800
need to get the file synchronization to

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,519
be really smooth

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,959
so your nodes appear other places

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,480
instantly

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,240
we need to of course pay attention to

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,959
power management we have a lot of stuff

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,760
cooking that is really exciting so

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,240
we are actually having a lot of fun

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,600
projects to work on

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,880
we do also have a pretty fun and modern

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,800
tech stack uh

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,160
for some people it might be familiar

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,720
it's

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,519
cute we have our own scene graph on the

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,720
device

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,480
due to the electronic ink display

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,680
uh that's some of the secret sauce um

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,399
how we get to render fast we

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,720
do use k archive so we are very thankful

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,839
for that that it's out there

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,200
some kde technologies on the device yeah

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,240
it's c plus plus 17

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,600
you get to ssh onto the device

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,000
so it's also fun to play with

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
we are based in oslo and norway the

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,800
company got started here

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,600
we are growing and we

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,800
are looking for people that might want

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,480
to join the journey

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,680
and uh so yeah really

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,720
fun stuff i hope everybody's having a

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,399
great conference

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,839
and thanks again greetings from

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,839
remarkable

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,839
thank you

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,320
hi everyone my name is wukashinski and i

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,040
am the community manager at pine64

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
for those of you who do not know of us

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,839
and

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,079
what it is that we do well we have a

00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:00,000
range of single board computers

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:03,200
compute modules and a wide variety

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,720
of arm-based devices

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,839
running open software we just recently

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,360
released our

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,839
newest single board computer called the

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,079
quartz 64 which is a platform which we

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,079
have very big plans for

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,959
moving forward but i would suppose that

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,839
most of you

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,560
listening to this know what's best for

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,560
the pine phone

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:32,720
a smartphone running full stack

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:36,640
regular linux with open drivers

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,839
we have been working with kde as well as

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,800
majora linux to make this happen and as

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,200
some of you probably know we currently

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,800
have

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,079
all our flagship devices so

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,880
notably the pine book pro and the pine

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,079
phone

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,120
shipping with their respective

00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,399
plasma user interfaces atop

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,680
of manjaro and we have been working very

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,079
closely with kde

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,440
on this and especially in the past

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,279
couple of months we have been

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,360
absolutely blown away by the progress

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,079
which has been

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,720
made so i'll keep this short for those

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,839
of you who are interested in what we do

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,839
um we foster a very large and

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:25,200
very friendly a and particularly

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,600
uh uh community

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,440
uh which is accessible on our forums and

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,040
chats and elsewhere

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,959
and anyone is welcome to take part we

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,600
include community members in our

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,519
decision making we ask for feedback

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,440
so forth and so on so there is always a

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,000
dialogue directly between us

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,760
and our end users as well as the

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,120
developers from partner projects who are

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,160
also part

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,800
partaking in this so

and i wish you all a very good and

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:07,839
fun academy this year

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,839
thank you

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
hi my name is alex lee i'm the ceo of

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,880
shells

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,760
i want to take a quick opportunity here

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,880
to thank

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,560
alesh and the rest of the kde team for

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,839
putting on this event

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,839
uh enjoying being a part of it and

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,560
looking forward to

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,560
all the other activities that that come

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,839
with the event so thank you again

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,360
so shells is a you know virtual desktop

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,360
solution we offer

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,040
it's a subscription based model where we

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,760
have different plans

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,880
uh for both monthly as well as annual

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,720
plans

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,440
but um you know simply put we offer a

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,760
virtual machine that can be accessed

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,880
from

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,760
any web enabled device as uh you can

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,279
access

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,279
your your shells machine from a browser

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,279
which gives you the ability to access it

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,399
from you know whether it's a

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,519
ipad or tablet a smartphone

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,320
you know a chromebook or even smart tv

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:19,040
you can essentially access your shells

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,440
machine from any of those devices

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,079
we also offer desktop and mobile apps as

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,519
well too

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,519
to to give that option

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,760
so we've we've worked really hard on

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,600
optimizing our technology and getting to

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,839
a point where basically you can

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,320
access your your virtual desktop from

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,160
any device in seconds so

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,320
like i mentioned before it's a little

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,399
literally just opening up a browser

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
logging into your account and then you

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,839
know clicking

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,040
to open your shell and literally in that

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,120
time that i spoke

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,639
you would also have a shell opened up

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,160
where you could do whatever work

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,920
you needed to and it would be right

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,560
where you left off because

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,440
your machine would stay on as long as

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,440
you wanted it to

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,000
so in terms of the different solutions

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,600
that we offer so

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360
you know our primary product being the

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,920
virtual desktop where

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,880
you know we do offer over 20 operating

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,000
systems so

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,639
this is where you know i think

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,440
we've tried to set ourselves differently

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,440
from others

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,880
and in offering multiple linux

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,000
distributions

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,040
as as well as windows even android

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,920
os is an option the other option is if

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,600
you choose to

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
you know you want to run a virtual

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,279
private server we do

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,759
have options for that as well too you

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,839
know you can get your own ip address and

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,600
and essentially you know run whatever

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,800
you need to run

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,839
as you would a typical vps service

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,320
and then finally with our android os

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,199
option we have been working hard on

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,600
creating

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,360
the virtual phone so this is something

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,839
that we're continuing to work on

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,959
but essentially you know we we have the

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,759
opportunity to

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,519
provision phone numbers and so on so you

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,279
could have a situation where it's almost

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,079
like a a phone and a phone

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,399
by by opening up shelves within a mobile

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,959
app

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,360
on your phone or again on the browser as

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,360
well too

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,680
so as i mentioned earlier we've been

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,959
working

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,240
uh you know to offer multiple linux

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,800
distributions and

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,320
you can see here we've announced a few

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,360
different partnerships

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,399
uh you know with kde as well as

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,079
mx linux linux mint opensuse as well as

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,360
manjaro

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,199
one of the things that we've been real

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,480
focused on is that the distros that

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,040
we're offering

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,040
have been um you know that essentially

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,240
we collaborate and work together with

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,839
the different

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,680
uh distros to make sure that we're

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,639
creating experience that they feel

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,639
comfortable with

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,320
that we feel comfortable with that

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,279
that's just going to be as seamless as

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,320
possible

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:02,320
um okay you know when virtualized so

00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,959
a couple other notes right we do own all

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,079
our

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,120
all of our own hardware you know we have

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,959
open sourced

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,919
some of our scripts and we'll continue

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,000
to to release more as we go on

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,520
uh we are rolling out more server

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,559
locations right now

we've been doing together with all these

different groups the partners that we

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,080
mentioned

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,240
and and we have ongoing work going on

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,320
with you know the folks here mentioned

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,640
cali zoran um deep in gnome

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,559
endless so you know several of these

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,520
other distributions we're also working

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,520
very closely with

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,640
so when you look at our technology you

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,799
know we

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,840
do utilize the spice protocol for the

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,160
remote access

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,880
um you know we're we're really happy

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,720
with

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,480
the way we've gone in terms of our

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,919
network infrastructure where it's really

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,080
built for growth it's

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,840
this plug-and-play model as we'll call

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,520
it so you know if we need to add

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,880
locations we really

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,320
simple not simplified the process to

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,240
to make it as seamless as possible

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,480
as we mentioned we've open sourced our

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,280
image build scripts

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,679
we're continuing to enhance our ability

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,600
to

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,960
build run and share your own custom

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,120
images within show

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,440
so that's something we're continuing to

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,600
enhance and optimize and we're really

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,919
excited about that

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,520
and then finally in terms of privacy

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,080
obviously that's that's always a

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,039
question

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,080
with uh anything that's being hosted in

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,000
in the cloud and

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,120
you know we do have the same privacy

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,520
standards as

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,200
as you expect from you know other cloud

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,640
providers such as dropbox and

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,039
digitalocean

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,799
and and obviously we're always looking

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:18,080
for ways to improve

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,080
uh our users security and privacy

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,120
and then finally just a few things in

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
our road map right so we we launched at

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,760
the beginning of the year we've been

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,799
announcing the different partnerships uh

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,039
you know we do

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,160
offer windows as well too it's another

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,559
option we've

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,080
we've made a few other enhancements to

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,120
different features

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,559
um you know we have our school pilots

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,720
that are ongoing

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,559
and then kind of looking ahead you know

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,880
we talked about the virtual private

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,760
servers the phone solutions

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,080
um enterprise has popped up as a as a

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
big

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,840
opportunity we've had a lot of small

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,960
businesses approach us

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,039
just because of our our price point and

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,440
you know the ease of use of our product

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,159
which is definitely something we like to

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,200
really advertise and push that we do

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,240
