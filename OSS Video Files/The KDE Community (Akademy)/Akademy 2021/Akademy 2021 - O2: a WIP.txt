00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,800

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,920
hello long time no see

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,519
i uh welcome uh to

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,519
the oh uh talk

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:31,840
or oxygen square or i don't know i uh

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,600
let's call it oxygen square or oh um

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,280
long time we'll see so the last time i

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,559
would i gave a

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,600
academy talk i was checking i think

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,760
it was in gran canaria

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,160
that was like 13 years ago

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,039
something like that i don't remember but

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,239
yeah it

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,360
quite a long time um without uh

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,160
talking to you guys um so

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
and okay it's great to be back uh great

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,480

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,239
talk and see everyone and

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,239

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,680
okay so me me um my name is nunu

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,960
um uh that is my email

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,400
for things non cadab i have another

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,159
email for cadavthings that is just like

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,600
that one but with kata um

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,439
who am i okay so i'm i'm i'm a designer

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,960
i used to be a civil engineer then

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,920
i started uh doing things with kde just

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,200
using it

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,200
there were a couple of icons that i

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,920
didn't like i made

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,799
new icons people liked it and

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,439
20 something years after apparently i'm

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,119
a

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,159
user ux ui designer

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,479
i do qml lots of things um

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,759
and lots of things kitty related i used

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,119
to be

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:05,200
way more involved in kde when it was

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,560
um on the on the

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,440
first days of plasma when and

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,720
the oxygen stuff uh which i'm still the

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,200
current maintainer

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,080
uh not the best maintainer but improving

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,560
on that

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
um so so yeah a little bit of experience

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,640
on

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,040
on kitty and hopefully most of you guys

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,800
know me or heard about me but if you

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,400
don't just

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,840
bear with me so this talk um

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
when i was thinking about doing this

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,959
talk because last year i

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599
uh i announced that i was going to

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,239
reboot

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,959
oxygen and do something around it i

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,440
wasn't

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,959
too sure about it it was mostly a

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,959
collection of ideas that i had

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,800
develop over the years uh about what i

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,160
could do next

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,480
in this space um and

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,440
uh like all good ideas and all great

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,080
plans things

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,640
fall fell apart they don't go according

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,200
uh

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,040
to your plans and this talk is a little

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
bit about this process this here that is

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
passed

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,480
i want to talk a little bit about um the

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,720
objectives and ideas that i

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:20,000
had for oxygen squared or oh

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,920
the reality and i think that um it's

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,239
also interesting to talk a little bit

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,799
more generically about what it is to

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,440
design in an open world what is specific

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,000
about it

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,480
so i have some i would like to share

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,319
some

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,959
ideas around that okay um

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,959
so um

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,000
a couple uh even before i say this so

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,200
the reason

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,519
maybe talking about a little bit of the

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,879
reason i started uh oxygen

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,319
uh squared um

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,760
back then a year ago i was um in a

00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,040
rough place um and i decided

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,799
it was about time um almost 10 years

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,080
that passed since the end

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,319
of former action i thought it was a good

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,200
idea to start

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,920
to start again and maybe fight one thing

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,439
that i want to mention here the female

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,479
the

00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:22,560
familiarity of of designing an open set

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,639
on on uh on the open space and designing

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,120
for big projects like eddie

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
um when i was designing when we were

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360
designing

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,400
not me alone at all um uh

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,199
oxygen um one thing that was fairly

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,840
obvious to me

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,960
is uh the tracing the tracing the

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,000
transient

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,320
nature of it um

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,240
and um i i knew all

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,840
from the beginning since the first

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,840
meeting i had with the guys

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,120
that uh it was something that was going

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,720
to last a few years

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,720
and then it would be trashed um

00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,840
because that's the nature of design it's

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,680
not like

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
the best code in the world might live

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,400
for a long long time

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,120
you maintain it it's it's really good

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,840
you build upon it and it moves on and

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,800
keeps on

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,560
being patched and improved because the

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,479
validity of the code itself

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:22,000
remains design is not like that

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,520
unfortunately design is a product

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,600
of time of its time and it's meaningful

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:33,680
while it um while it retains

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:37,199
some uh some today uh

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,680
some some relevance to the to the today

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,120
where it's being used so it for me it's

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,120
always obvious that oxygen

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
uh original was ephemeral and it was

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,199
going to

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,280
end up in a day um so

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,960
when i think when uh whether the time

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,560
when the time came and it was

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,840
mostly when a new cute was

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,759
lurking in and i knew okay new

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,360
plasma is going to come out and kde is

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,080
going to come out maybe it's a good idea

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,280
to

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,919
to kill this and and or

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,720
stop it a bit and see what else the the

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,759
nature

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,120
of design uh creates inside tv

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,840
and amazingly uh things work out

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
really well and we have bris today um

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,880
but yeah

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
i wanted to mention that uh designing

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,919
and it's just

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,280
only for open source uh it's a little

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,880
bit

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:33,039
everywhere but it on on on open source

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,759
we do feel the effemero to ephemerality

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,280
oh my god

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
i should have used a better word

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,319
of it so what's the point

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,160
what's the point of of doing this thing

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,840
if it's

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,759
do when thresh away um and to me

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,960
it was well the fun of creating it um

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,840
it's a lot of fun i i don't know um

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,560
i feel the arch to i always felt the

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,639
urge to

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,759
draw little things and communicate and

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,560
do

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,840
do something and it it's a lot of fun it

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,360
was a lot of fun to do

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,240
oxygen back then especially because i

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,520
didn't know anything um

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,039
and just just getting the feedback and

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,199
giving back to

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,800
other people in kitty and that were

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,160
doing that amazing work and i was giving

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
back and getting communication from them

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,160
that was

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,680
a lot of fun um also spreading my edge

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,400
like there were little things like

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,120
kitty was awesome i love kitty i still

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,479
love kitty

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,039
um seriously

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,199
but uh there was you know there's little

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,160
things that if you can fix it it'll be

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,240
perfect

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,440
uh so i started uh scratching those

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,000
little hedges that

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,560
that i had that just a few uh you know

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,960
because

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,000
it's almost perfect already if i fix one

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
or two things it's going to be

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,960
completely perfect

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,520
yeah um and and so

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,919
that was one of the reasons uh working

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,360
with great people it's amazing um

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,919
uh the the the scope and i can't

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,560
uh stress this enough about about doing

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,440
design

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,639
uh in open source is that you get to you

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,599
get two things

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,319
you get to work with some of the most

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,759
brilliant

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,080
smart good people i've ever met

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,039
some of my best friends are i met them

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,160
through kitty

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,400
uh my work i started from

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,199
from kitty it's an amazing experience

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,599
that gets you

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
a range of experience in the design

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,080
space

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:37,279
that is really really hard to to find in

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,760
other areas in professional work those

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,800
the type of problems that you are faced

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,640
uh when doing

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,440
um a complete desktop design

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,120
is something that most designers don't

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,920
in their entire life in their entire

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
career

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,360
they don't face those those sort of

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,680
questions or problems to

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,360
to have to solve so it's it's amazing

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,160
and the baggage that he gives

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:06,959
it gives you as a designer is great

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:10,160
slight problem it's a lot of work

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,519
yeah uh that is

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,360
uh one of the problems uh something

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:20,720
uh like oxygen was is it was and is

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,959
uh i bet breeze is also uh extremely

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,680
taxing on your

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,120
time that you have available and for me

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,720
when i was starting uh

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,399
that was three times more true because

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,120
my experience was very

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,800
tiny uh so i had to do things three

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,480
times i even tried to do a complete

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,399
black icon set that people didn't like

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,600
i still i still have that against you

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,600
and by you i mean david

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,720
and um so yeah

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,680
uh we have to i had to learn a lot and

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,720
things take time

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
uh probably if i was doing it now

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,399
things go a lot faster because you have

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,600
experience but it's

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,600
also not exactly the same thing um

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,279
doing something out of experience

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,800
sometimes cuts your

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,040
uh your uh innocence and

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,160
those kind of things do show up in the

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,640
in a

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,640
in the gym

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,800
of a style but yeah it's it's life and

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,760
there's nothing i

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,760
really can do about it

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,120
what we got out of oxygen back then um

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,920
so that's actually something i i like

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,480
and i'm quite proud about oxygen um

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,760
design wise it's probably not the best

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,399
thing ever

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,440
um i'm just i'm suspicious right uh

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,839
asking me if this

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,839
if the design of watson was good or bad

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,959
my opinion is suspected but to be very

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,160
honest i don't think it was the most

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,320
brilliant thing ever

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,519
but one thing was brilliant is that

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,440
before oxygen

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,880
um the theming aspect on kitty and most

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,079
open source projects that

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,880
that i knew um were

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,160
pretty much based on okay we'll do an

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,040
icon set

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,519
and that's it we'll have a look at a

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,519
couple of

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,959
other things but we mostly focus on an

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,279
icon set and maybe a

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,480
theme but that was quite rare more on

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,760
the gnome side

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,680
uh the they add this look but it is

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,279
it was fairly at this conjunct

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,200
disconjuncted

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:35,600
effort with oxygen with that change the

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,120
auction that by the way is set up to be

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,839
just and i can think

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,040
uh ended up being everything everything

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,480
designed

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:48,480
we design uh everything on a glo

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,920
on on a global scale so not exactly like

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,639
uh uh the breeze guys are doing right

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,600
now which is

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,720
much more focused on on everything and

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
the apps itself

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,240
that that was the next step i hope

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,040
people would do

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,519
and they did um but before it wasn't

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,639
like that

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,519
and uh uh with oxygen

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,399
and also the the what gnome was doing

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,040
back then

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,399
thing design became platforms the design

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,519
open source became

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,399
actually platforms of uh a

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,680
a range of work and that was uh

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,000
something that i'm

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,320
quite proud to be a proud a part of it

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,680
and i think that any

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,720
decently well-structured design

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,519
project in open source

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,519
should aim to be

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,440
so uh this is uh

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,839
how does it work like okay the design

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,040
but

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,040
it comes out nothing

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,600
mostly but but i do

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,839
ponder some questions um and

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,519
when i'm doing design for say a customer

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,920
i i usually go with

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,279
the three basic questions like i asked

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,200
um

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,000
the customer like what do you do

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,560
what is the function of this what's your

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,560
user

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,320
and can you define yourself in three

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,320
objectives um

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
this is something i do i'm probably many

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,440
other designers do

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,800
different questions and if i answer if i

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,120
had to answer well

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,079
the answers to these questions as far as

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,600
i knew it

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,720
in oxygen days is that one uh and if you

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,800
remember the question

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,160
uh what we are uh

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,639
as far as i know uh and uh i looked it

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,480
up

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
we are officially a desktop for

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,839
materials

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,120
uh girlfriend um and this okay

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,240
it's a myth uh but i actually like this

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,920
definition right

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,800
it on the core it was um

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,279
a desktop for human beings like it's for

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,639
your

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,560
girlfriend for your mother for your

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,680
father for your

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,480
friends it's um it's a little bit more

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,240
than

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,760
a desktop to code a desktop uh at least

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,160
that uh this definition is is something

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,519
i

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,519
really loved um

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,160
the users so if you take that that i

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,120
just said and think about the users

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,240
you would say that they are everyone but

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
to be honest

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,160
internally we were kind of focusing on

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,079
two types of users

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,360
so we were focusing mostly on early

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,000
adopters and

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,120
text enthusiasts so that gave us a

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
little bit more

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,440
a little bit more focus in terms of the

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,360
design that we were creating

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,480
uh in terms of finding our target group

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,480
and in terms of

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,560
uh the three objectives i never got to

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,560
ask so i

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,639
uh uh i use this ones internally i

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,160
then to be honest i didn't ask this

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,800
question because i didn't

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
i didn't add the experience but looking

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,600
back

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,120
uh i tried to answer it myself and i i

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,079
think back then

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:09,680
if i had to define my work it would be

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,720
open free and positive i always thought

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,120
to me kitty was always this it was a

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,760
very

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:21,600
positive community with freedom in mind

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,639
and very open to contributions and to

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:28,800
other people coming in

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:32,320
so o2 uh as i said so uh

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,360
last year i was not in the best place

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,040
um and i i

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,199
i need to do something um uh for me

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,480
and i decided okay let's let's do

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,519
something that i know that i'm

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,639
i'm happy with uh and doing

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,800
oxygen work was probably it was a lot of

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,160
work but one of the most

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,639
uh fun times of my life so let's try

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,000
this

00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:02,560
one more time with a lot more experience

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,320
uh and maybe this works so

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,959
one of the things i didn't mention is

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,320
that doing a

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:13,519
design uh for not you

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,000
with a user in mind um is a very

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,120
technical task it's actually it's very

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,160
people we used to call us

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,519
artists um and it wasn't quite quite

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,360
honest to

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,160
to call a designer an artist

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,199
because it's a fairly technical matter

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,160
we do

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,199
do artsy things but most of the

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,360
decisions are actually

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,480
quite rational or they should be uh

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,920
quite rational

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,720
so uh

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,360
and they are done rationally with the

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,199
user

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,199
and the user expectations in mind and

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,680
trying to deliver a function

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,959
trying to fulfill function so that

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,800
that's the sort of thing that we're

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,680
trying to do back then

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,160
but for oxygen to our auction square or

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,519
oh

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,800
um i thought okay i'm going to do it

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,319
for me and i don't care about what

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,079
everybody is going to say

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,839
if they like it it's great if they don't

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,360
like it they can complain

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:15,839
to me and by me and my wife

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:19,600
next um

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,480
if this goes to the next slide yeah um

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,280
so my user uh that makes it simple i

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,400
already told you

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,760
it's me uh and

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,799
the the the three objectives i

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,919
want to make it fun because i want to

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,200
have fun with it

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,559
i want to make it cool that's a very

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,320
blanket statement and i want to make it

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:47,679
yours uh right that works

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,559
great plan one of the advantage

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,440
is that now it might not be as ephemeral

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,000
because now

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
uh since i'm making it for myself and

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,520
i'm

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,720
not really making such

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,200
a design thing and more over

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,799
artsy whatever i want to communicate

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,039
with you guys

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,200
maybe this is less thermal because it's

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,840
more of a art installment

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,679
maybe this works i don't know we'll see

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,720
um so

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,760
uh and and what is uh

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,280
what is supposed to have um okay

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,840
um it it's a theme it's it's basically

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,440
oxygen

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,360
i'll be honest basically all the things

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,400
that old auction was

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,120
i'm trying to go to do it in uh

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,360
this new thing so it's a widget theme a

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,240
plasma theme and i can theme

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,799
and everything thing um so that's that's

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,200
the goal

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:48,799
uh including anything that's needed um

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,480
i will try to too minus the application

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,960
integration stuff

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,520
and all of that because it's that is

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,400
such a

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,080
sinkhole of time props and respect to

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,640
the to the people that do that

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,640
all the time

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,400
um some plans so i i

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,320
this i'm going to talk about the the

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,600
plans that i had uh

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,200
i have some over the years developed a

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,559
couple of plans and one thing

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,320
that i uh at the end of august of

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,480
old oxford and i i thought that was

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,960
fairly obvious is that consistency

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,400
and the way we say consistency sometimes

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,880
doesn't mean really consistency

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,000
the consistency it was kind of hoped

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,799
that if every app

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,440
used a the same widget theme the same

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,960
colors

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,799
and the same icons it would be

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,679
consistent that wasn't

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,240
quite true because apps sometimes are

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,360
not

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,559
the same and the consistent is not just

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,200
adding same size buttons with the same

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,640
colors

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,440
um if one app has 10 a row of 10 buttons

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,360
and another one

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,960
is just as one we didn't save anything

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,720
it's inconsistency it's in those two are

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,120
very inconsistent

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,200
so what we had helped

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,880
but i think to express and to give

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,919
better uh

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,919
better uh experiences to users

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:20,159
um things like

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:23,840
information density uh the way we draw

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:27,919
things uh what we express

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,960
is actually more important than the

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,480
just having everything the same um

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,440
so i want to enable a

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,559
a oxygen squared experience where you

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,760
get a file

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,000
um and everything changes so

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,760
it doesn't even matter that applications

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,880
do look different like for example

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,159
we do already like creature doesn't look

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,440
the same as uh dolphin

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,120
um because krita has its own needs it's

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,720
actually very

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,480
that leads to the next point i was going

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,039
to mention it's very dense

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,480
in terms of information and tools that

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,559
it requires and

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,600
uh that was one thing that we missed

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,760
dearly in the back

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,559
in the old days is it was really hard to

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,240
make applications that were very

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,919
dense in terms of tools and uh

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,640
um interaction points because

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,000
historically we were very i used to call

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,720
it frame framing we

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,360
used to have loads of frames on top of

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,679
frames

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,480
it it made it difficult for for

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,520
application developers to create

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,120
nice balanced

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,000
uis where the where an application that

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,039
actually needs

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,960
like create a lot of tools on the side

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,559
uh could actually make those tools

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,679
available without cluttering and

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,840
pestering everything

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,840
because they are so big and there's so

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,400
much widget tree

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,400
against it

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,720
so that was that's one thing that i

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,559
would like

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,559
oxygen to be able to provide uh

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,880
a application can look different

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,679
and still look consistent an application

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,240
can still

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,200
as one application can have tons of

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,400
information

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,280
another one be very clean and they still

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,440
fit they still like it they still look

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,200
like they belong in the same space

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,120
so i would like to actually one of the

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,000
things that auxin should do

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,480
oxygen 2 should do is is at this

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,960
experience button like you click you get

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,679
a button someone that gets you the full

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,440
experience

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,640
and boom you get what

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:45,120
for now is my perfect desktop

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,120
that's the idea was you'll see

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:55,840
so currently uh and by currently i mean

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,840
as it was when i was starting on this

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,640
i started with uh with a widget theme

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,520
because if

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,000
i in my brain if i would nail the widget

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,520
theme

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,360
i would actually have 90 of the work

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,000
uh done because in my real

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,600
day-to-day life that's actually it and

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,480
when i

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,520
it there's a talk by a designer that

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,720
she's she's amazing and she goes about

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,559
the solemn and the and the artwork

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,960
um and in my day-to-day

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,640
work doing the first mock-ups that's the

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,840
artwork it takes it doesn't take all

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,840
that long

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,280
but that's where you define the core

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,760
identity of what you

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,840
want to be and what you should be and

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,240
this these guys took me like two months

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
to

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,559
to come up with and i was super happy

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,159
super stoked that i think i nailed it i

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,679
think i have some

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:54,720
a good language here that is scalable

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,520
that i can push into further directions

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,360
that i can do multiple things with and

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,960
it was really working well for me i

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,520
thought okay this is going way

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,320
way faster because back back in the

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,880
beginning

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,880
uh when oxen came out i remember i went

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,000
through

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,600
like months of iterations over

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,600
the widget style and the window

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,240
decoration style

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,799
overall auction and this came out really

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,440
quickly

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,159
and i actually like it i think it scales

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,279
nicely

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,600
i made lots of work in trying to make

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,520
the the things work in big sizes and

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,840
small sizes that so that they

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,360
look like they belong but they still

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,400
give you the freedom to have

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,039
very sparse uis uh

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,200
in terms of again information density

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,480
and also very cluttered uis in terms of

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,799
information density

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,559
without looking very cluttered so if you

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,360
notice the the

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,559
everything is very i try to make

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,919
everything very

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:57,600
subtly present it's present but it's not

00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:01,600
overwhelmingly present therefore i can

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,559
um add this more uh this this

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,919
gap um available and also give it a

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,080
little bit more freedom expressive

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,640
rhythm so things can be

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,159
some buttons an application might like a

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,000
button to be round another application

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,799
might like a button to be

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,559
at only round corners uh one might even

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,600
like to have square corners

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,720
um as long as things actually look like

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,480
they belong together

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:30,000
i think we could get it and i i was

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,880
i'm fairly happy with this guys so

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,360
um the only thing that i wasn't uh i've

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
still

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,679
not nailed completely is the multiple

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,240
colors

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,520
so another thing that i was thinking uh

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,279
one when doing this

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,919
is based on um

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,200
on the work that uh you know the the

00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,960
finnish company that

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,960
spun off out of uh nokia days yola

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,919
um they had this mobile

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,520
experience one thing i loved about it

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,400
was the possibility to choose a

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,919
wallpaper

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,600
and magically it would make your ui

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,960
have a color plaid so if you know color

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,919
palettes for

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,960
for widgets in uh in the cute world in

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,320
kde world

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,960
it's a mess to put it mildly

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,840
it's tons and tons and tons of tons of

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,880
options and

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,159
just setting up the colors cohesively

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,080
it's a lot of work and it shouldn't be

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,840
when i have to come up with a platform

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,960
application

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,440
most i just pick one two three

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,320
four colors and all the other kernels

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,679
that i need

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,120
actually come naturally and i believe

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,159
there's a certain

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,120
algorithm to it um that will

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,000
would allow us to with a very simple

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,840
base

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,120
generate all the colors which would

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,360
allow us finally to

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,799
maybe do the thing that you all did just

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,039
pick a wallpaper

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,039
say do you want to apply the entire you

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,640
this uh do you want to make a color pull

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,440
it out of this wallpaper

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,440
yes uh see how it works i have a

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,799
suspicion that it could work

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,279
um but

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,240
i'm struggling a little bit about the

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,559
transitional

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,799
colors for the backgrounds of windows so

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,399
this is a zoom and i'm showing the

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,440
dark window that i'm really happy with

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:26,799
the concept is around stone so

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,120
maybe a uh basalt type of stone

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,919
and i'm really happy the dark colors

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,360
actually work

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:36,399
really well the light colors i'm

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,159
i only got it to work okayish

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:43,039
on on on this variant which is kind of

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,120
not a rock so i try to think about white

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,919
rocks that i like or light rocks that i

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,520
like

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:53,760
and the marble is a no unless it's

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,279
a very weird window decoration

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,520
maybe some people would like it i

00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,640
wouldn't

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,880
and the macros and limestone

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,080
it doesn't lend itself really well

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,480
really well on

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,919
on macro pictures so i ended up with

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,760
this kind of

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,799
um uh surface of

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,279
uh pearls you know the the inside of a

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,640
shell

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:21,039
that's at that glittery colory

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,880
uh reflections i think that could work

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,279
it's just not working for

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,960
other variations it works really well on

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,120
a very white

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:34,480
um space when i start to implement

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,039
yellows and greens and lime greens and

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,279
stuff

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,320
it just looks weird it probably doesn't

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,120
lend itself to

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,480
to those sort of colors all styles are

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,080
not

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,000
not like that they always struggle with

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,279
this sort of thing i just thought i

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:59,840
could do for

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:59,840
any color but maybe i can't

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,840
it seems we've lost no no perhaps oh i

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,600
see him already

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:17,039
reconnecting no are you here

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:20,480
yes okay very good

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,799
please continue okay uh

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,640
let me show you something do not use the

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,640
side button on your mouse

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,679
it will take you out of the window of

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,799
your browser

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:36,559
bad idea sorry guys um

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:39,200
so where was i okay so uh here i am

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,919
the the problem is the real work let's

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,360
let's face reality the plans are amazing

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,960
um and i'm totally okay with the

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,399
heathos of the style the general ideas i

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:57,600
i love them all most of them and

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:59,440
and so what's the problem um

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,760
the problem is a little bit what i

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,200
believe i need

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,880
and what i can live without without

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,440
um so when i was starting this i was

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,799
starting

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,440
much and thinking how hard can it be

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,159
based on my day-to-day experience and

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,120
when i'm doing

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,080
uh design for a client i think okay i if

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,840
i do the

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,720
general mock-ups um i have a couple of

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,520
of nfid do the same thing that i just

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,799
did there

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:34,320
uh i think i'm mostly done it's okay

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:37,679
um here i

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,640
did found a problem and i'll talk about

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,159
this problem

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,679
by the way oh also

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:48,880
in real world uh time uh this guy

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,880
says that it's relative ye yeah uh

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,559
i can run as fast as i can it's not

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,240
being any relative to me

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:59,440
24 hours are still only 24 hours and it

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,039
is mostly for me and for other people

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:07,840
um turns out

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:11,840
that me um not the greatest user ever

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:15,760
um i'm a whiny

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,760
i can say that because myself

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,159
i was doing things then i uh so me the

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,080
user

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,440
uh was starting to like it yeah good job

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,960
good job pat on the back

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,519
uh but then uh i told me the user told

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,480
me the

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,080
designer to okay it's time that you do

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,600
the icons

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,559
which shouldn't be too much of a work

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,559
because um

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,919
these days icons um

00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,720
[Music]

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,360
are supposed to be simple um i'm from

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,760
the day that uh i actually got mad when

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,399
this

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,720
um uh anti-skelemorphic blah blah thing

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,000
came to be and i felt like i was being

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,480
insulted with it

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,399
um but then i realized yeah yeah it's

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,919
the end of

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:06,880
an era as something new is beginning

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,399
but these new icons that are being done

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,960
these days

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,440
in multiple platforms to me it takes

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,640
like

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,039
yeah minutes to do it's it's a little

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,240
bit

00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,200
absurd and action icons i can spawn them

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,480
over in

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,720
minutes the problem is that me the user

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,559
was really not liking them

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,559
and i decided okay i need to do

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,919
something that is simple

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:34,480
but flexible that can do lots of things

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,960
but that is modern that is great and i

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,919
did

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,200
i did post a couple of versions that i

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,000
thoroughly deleted from

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,760
all our drives to never to be seen again

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,480
um

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,120
uh about possible solutions and

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,159
languages that would allow us to do

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,799
uh lots of some icons not

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,159
that was probably the problem so they

00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,600
were pretty

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:03,440
they were engaging and they were simple

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,399
but they didn't scale uh it's it was a

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,760
great

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,960
most of those languages that i tried um

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,799
either i didn't like it or um

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,799
they didn't scale in terms of

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,279
variability that we need uh

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,000
a if this is if this was the client's

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,480
work we're

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,919
talking about i don't know in terms of

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,120
action icons the ones that you see in

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,399
the app we're talking about

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,440
30 40 items in terms of application icon

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,640
it's one

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,640
in terms of branding it's the

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,279
application i can with a little bit of

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,320
flare

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,799
um and and maybe there's a mime type

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,240
so that's easy that scales really nicely

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,320
at most uh

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,080
it's a set of applications so we need a

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,559
little bit of

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,279
consistency of course across application

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,640
icons

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:52,159
that do have a branding aspect to it

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,960
but that's fairly easy in oxygen not so

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,000
much we're talking thousands of icons

00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,120
and it wasn't scaling for me and

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,120
this got me really depressed uh and for

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,399
i don't know six seven months i didn't

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,519
touch this at all

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,079
i i looked at it and hoped that because

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,200
sometimes

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,159
things will happen like this uh i don't

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,960
know what i'm doing

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,839
but i stopped working it and some by

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,879
magic

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:22,079
one fine day an idea comes up and

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,639
i go for it um but no

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,960
uh it didn't came and uh the only thing

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,240
that got me is more and more depressed

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:34,800
um and uh yeah

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,399
that wasn't a nice place to be um

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:42,399
turns out that

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:44,560
i kind of like this old oxygen stuff

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,079
because i was i'm still to this day

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,679
using the things

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,800
that i did again bias

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,960
um so it's not like it's

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,640
terrible okay a few things like are bad

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,240
yeah i knew that they were bad 10 years

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,680
ago so they are still bad today i

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,480
haven't fixed them

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,760
but maybe i could start with with this

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,359
until you know that

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,240
grand idea comes so i decided that okay

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,000
for now let's

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:17,839
use oxygen and um the old oxygen icons

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,839
and move them to to the git repo and

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,880
let's start with this and try to evolve

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,880
the other stuff um

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,119
and so i did uh but

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,760
a couple of missings so i i okay let's

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,040
have a look at the current state of

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,200
affairs like

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,240
if i want to start really doing this i

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,960
need to look at the

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,079
how things are looking today and the

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,760
first thing i open is

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,000
system settings let's see how system

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,599
stack things loads on the brace and

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,160
compared to how it looks in

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,920
oxygen the first thing i see oh oxygen

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,240
is missing a couple of icons

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,760
need to fix that so i went and fixed

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,839
that

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,880
and it was i think it was the the

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,200
printer

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,320
and kitty connect i think those were

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,480
missing and they were

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,760
another one that was missing so i i did

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,240
those

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,040
and okay and i pushed them to auction so

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,240
now it's

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,560
auction is after many many years has

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,000
been

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,640
upgraded a bit um and i did a few more

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,520
so i did

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,800
i i started okay this is i started

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,359
having fun again um

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,440
and okay let me just fix this and this

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,400
and this and i ended up fixing one two

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,200
three four

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,760
five six seven and a couple more that uh

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,440
i

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,920
are not visible on the screen um

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,280
and i was having fun right and that

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,640
that's the point right having fun

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,320
is the is my goal um

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,760
and now the idea started to to grow in

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,160
me like

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,440
maybe oxen wasn't really that bad okay

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,280
if i kill

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:55,520
these if i would kill these and

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,520
maybe these i'm not sure

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,200
maybe i'm into something maybe maybe

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,160
just adjusting

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,960
a new auction could be could be

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,800
something

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,320
so these are some of the ones that i

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,240
worked on now okay by the way having me

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,599
as a user is the worst case

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,839
so uh these are icons are only used in

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,280
32 by 32 pixels

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,560
why do i have to do them in this huge

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,040
sciences

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,079
because i'm the worst user that's all i

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,440
have to say

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,280
um so i i uh i decided

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,720
but it's it's an experiment right i'm

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,640
trying to experiment and trying to see

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,680
the flexibility of the solution to see

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,640
if i can do something

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,800
better and these are icons that i can

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,000
actually relate to i actually like them

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,119
i think they are

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,960
they are modern enough and they

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:50,079
will work there is um

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,040
so uh an uh point there so

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,520
below this guy here is the action mark

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,839
and i think

00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,720
action icons i will need to do them in

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,839
line art

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:03,119
action icons are you know actually we in

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,160
open source in our sets we tend to

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,839
divide things into

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,760
catchphrase and one of the main

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,359
categories are action items and action

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,560
icons are the icons that you see

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,359
inside applications and in auction they

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,839
were

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:20,480
really very visually heavy they were

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:23,040
artsy and maybe that's not what the user

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,640
wants the user the user uses them

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,640
mostly as a quick guide to reach a tool

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,079
he doesn't need to marvel at the beauty

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,520
of an icon which

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:36,560
most of them didn't have anyway so

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,320
maybe those i want to do uh in small

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,440
size i'm not sure about the 48

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,720
so there's multiple slides there's 16 24

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,280
or 22 depending

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:50,480
uh 32 and 48 maybe 48 and some apps

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,359
are good um

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,920
but uh i'll have to have a look about

00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,040
that

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,880
uh but we'll keep on evolving on that

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,400
uh but i'm pretty sure that action

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,680
hackings will be line art

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,839
type of thing um and now this this

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,040
actually leads into us having a language

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,240
um i think

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,280
so sorry to suppose you hear a moment

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,480
we do have two minutes left um just to

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,280
as a reminder

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,760
yep i'm almost done this is the almost

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,960
last

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,720
uh slide

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,359
um so uh

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,480
really quickly uh i i think i have a

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,320
language here

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,079
if i stick to basically these shapes

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,079
that if you notice i'm doing on the

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,480
previous slide

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,320
so it's basically okay i know the the

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,440
last the last shape was the cube

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,880
and that implies a a

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,599
type of angle we can look at objects

00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,040
front forward but only tilting it here

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,320
so we don't tilt it

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,079
all over the place like we did in

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,440
auction so this is a that's all i'm

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,800
trying to focus more

00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,680
on consistency of shapes using the same

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,200
shapes to

00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,359
to to to generate

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,560
similar things a bit like i'm doing here

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,280
as you notice like

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,960
connections and device connections same

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,920
basic shape

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,040
and doing the two out recognizability

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,599
using the square as

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,319
a thing you know use squares for a

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,760
device okay

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,680
that's the idea i don't know if that

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,640
works uh so apparently

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,920
almost all the time um if you want to uh

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,280
so i really like

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,440
the the talk that jerry ellsworth did

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,800
uh on academy that was amazing and she

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,920
was talking about uh

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,800
mentors right so i had the best mentors

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,200
in when i joined kitty i had devi

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,599
vignoni i had kenneth wimmer i had

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,880
a little bit of a problem even um and

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,520
lots of people with lots of experience

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,359
that helped me

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:52,400
a lot in in becoming a designer today

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,760

for the oxygen stuff i need help in lots

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,280
of things i'll need help for the widget

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,599
plasma for plasmaes

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,440
for components and

00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,800
please join me for mentoring design fun

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,160
i'll try to help you guys

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,280
like a lot of times for questions

00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,000
uh thank you nuno indeed we have run out

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,000
of time

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,839
for questions but one of the questions

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,359
was posted by alex who's the next

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,160
speaker so maybe

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,359
he doesn't mind if you answer his about

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,599
that

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,760
the question is do you still expect

00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,280
users to render icons from a

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:49,680
pixel map in a world with high dpi

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,760
displays uh

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,880
do we have two hours to discuss how much

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,640
i hate svg for rendering

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,000
i love svg that's the tool i use every

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,839
day but

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,119
you don't want to get me started on that

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,560
discussion

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,880
okay thank you there's also a question

00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,640
from

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,720
marco martin maybe just quickly palette

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,319
generated from the wallpaper what do you

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,839
think it should happen when there are

00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,000
multiple screens with different

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,760
wallpapers

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,599
that's why i don't that's why i don't

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,200
like martin he always makes the

00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,760
worst questions i hate you martin

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,119
well in theory in terms of the of the

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,119
user experience like

00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,960
it would be an option to the user so

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,160
it's it's not automatically

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,880
the user uh chooses a wallpaper

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,720
and a secondary option or secondary a

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,960
question that is made to the user

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,800
is do you want create to generate the

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,720
theme out of this wallpaper

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,119
so it's uh it's on the user it's not

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,839
it's it's not trying to because yeah

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,599
marco may

00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,200
makes an awesome point if it was auto

00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,560
automatic and we have multiple

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,319
papers nothing looks good no just

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,319
just one and maybe in the secondary

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,119
option and still it's just an idea that

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,560
i had i

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,599
actually don't know okay thank you very

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,960
much luna for

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:12,400
this presentation um

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,440
thank you again and hope you stick with

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,160
us for the

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,960
last talk and then the closing remarks

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:23,680
as well

00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,680
