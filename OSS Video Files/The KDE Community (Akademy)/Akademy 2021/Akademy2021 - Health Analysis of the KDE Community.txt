Title: Akademy2021 - Health Analysis of the KDE Community
Publication date: 2021-06-29
Playlist: Akademy 2021
Description: 
	By Carl Schwan
This short talk will be focused on an analysis of various projects inside KDE using their git histories. It is some sort of continuation of this blog post: https://carlschwan.eu/2021/04/29/health-of-the-kde-community/, but with more plots and data. More importantly, I want to take a step back and look at the lessons we learned along the way and how we can help our community to grow more in the future.

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,279
hello everyone

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:21,600
another video appears on the screen

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,320
yes okay perfect let me get started

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,199
okay so uh everyone i will present to

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,719
talk about the help of the kd community

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:35,920
my name is my name is in season

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,480
8 2018 and i'm attributing to the

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,600
website documentation promotion

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,000
um i think

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,680
because of what i have got some good

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,960
overview of

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,879
multiple things in uh kdea

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,079
and i'm just going to do it and get some

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
human applications

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,960
and here's my mail

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,680
this is actually a continuation of

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,239
previous blog posts of mine

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,799
uh it's a similar analysis

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,960
to uh but ants peter johnson good for

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,000
the norm and it's using his tool

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,119
named fronda

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
so that's a quick recap of my previous

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,680
blog post

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,759
i had some analysis of how the

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,799
cavity repositories um

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,439
how to it is crafts but

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,439
the beige

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,560
crabs are but the new contributors are

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,240
the okay generic contributors

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,759
and then the color represents the

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,280
contributors that

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,840
are started in 2017 the first of all for

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,880
the red

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,520
color and you can see how the evolves on

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,840
the

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,079
time and the same thing about the

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,439
commits

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,159
and in our commits it's interesting is

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,799
to see what

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:06,000
um while uh most of the contributors are

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,200
started three years ago around

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,280
i was on twice two years ago in terms of

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,560
commits

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,879
it's mostly uh old-timers who present

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,640
most of seconds uh some

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,480
not not what i need to write whereas the

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,920
studio

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,480
statistics for example did project what

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,599
didn't

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,760
get a git repository anymore for

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,200
completion to conduct an svn

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,200
that appeared statistics

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
there are some duplicate commits for

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,160
example twitter some straight

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,440
history and so it doesn't handle names

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,280
change

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,280
so first of all material but

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,120
uh and what i did is to

00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:01,040
try to create um analysis for her

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,000
some small um for separates and

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
cycling so for example for our plasma

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,480
this

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:12,239
other statistics uh we can see what

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,120
for the uh 2020 with

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
kit lab and this is maybe there's a lot

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,640
of

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,080
new contributors compared to the other

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,640
yes

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,480
um the first that was 2007

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,560
the data are a bit wrong because it

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,560
doesn't include

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
whether there was some real white and a

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,319
lot of history keto 3 was lost

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:41,360
and in the whites

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,360
of plasma or kde 4.

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,840
yeah it's a bit smearer

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:54,560
for kdp the numbers are not looking

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,760
that good there was a loss of

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,879
number of contributors around 2009

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,159
uh 110 after that

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,879
and he didn't recover a lot

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,200
and uh in terms of commits most of the

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,400
commits are done by

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,519
very very few number of contributors

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,919
like for example you can see low hotel

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:22,000
it is uh in

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,600
i mean some really large portion of the

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,120
commits

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,840
for education it's uh mostly stable is

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,840
decreasing a bit

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,720
and for the commit a lot of variation

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,720
between the gas

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,520
and for the games it's also not really

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,520
looking that good but need to understand

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,680
but most of the games are

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,120
mostly done and don't need to have

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,840
more um contributions over from

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,840
king some stuff and colonialization

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:06,479
for calica after 2012

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,000
most of the number of contributors

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,600
decreased a lot due to the

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
and nokia are stopping to contribute to

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,520
um

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,639
the cargo project and in 2015 then when

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,000
krita

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,400
moved to a new repository as a as a

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,160
as a really big decrease of

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,039
contributions

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:36,000
uh but for example for future we can

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,639
see what it means there's a lot of

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,759
increase

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,960
of contribution mostly into 2020 with

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,360
intuition of github and

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,840
maybe other factors there was like a big

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
increase

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,560
and as

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,080
and i think as of from this graph you

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,919
can see also what the krita

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,919
committee is able to maintain

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,639
the contributors for younger

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,039
uh time plasma mobile there is a smaller

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,360
time scale

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,720
but you also can see what the others is

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,639
like a exponential

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,639
uh number of contributors and

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,400
commits i hope it's stay

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,400
like this for a longer time

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,759
okay in terms of which it is that's the

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,280
statistic of the visit of

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,039
cave.org and

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,360
the the us's has a lot of uh visitors

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,479
and

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:45,680
uh that actually europe is like

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:48,000
44 and not not american as a

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,000
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,759
[Music]

00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:02,000
commits others to the visits and so yeah

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:03,919
don't really have a lot of visitors on

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,520
coming from africa and users probably

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,280
also to have it that's stuff on

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,400
candy.org so with the so it doesn't

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,919
reflect exactly

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,160
uh of many users we have but we give an

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,160
idea of the exclusion

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,360
and for the seconds for example for

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,039
twitter it's

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,960
increasing uh the times this starts

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,080
only too far to 20 2019

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,000
but now we have lucky and

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,160
90 000 subscribers of computers

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
with increasing out still in prison

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,840
okay um questions

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,039
since we don't have the question

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,080
switched for the lightning talks

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,680
uh i guess you can uh monitor the

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,680
chat yeah

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,840
if there are any

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:39,200
uh yes for plasma active uh

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,240
i put the kigami

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,399
repository and coco pository we have

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,000
some longer activity from the

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,080
plasma mobile

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,080
[Music]

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,800
and from the mobile project so

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:02,000

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
i plus my developments

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,360
okay thank you very much carl since this

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,240
is a lightning round no we don't have

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,200
too much time for

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,839
for questions yeah yeah thank you thank

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
