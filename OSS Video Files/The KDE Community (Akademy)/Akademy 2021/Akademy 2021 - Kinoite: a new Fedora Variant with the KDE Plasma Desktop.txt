Title: Akademy 2021 - Kinoite: a new Fedora Variant with the KDE Plasma Desktop
Publication date: 2021-06-29
Playlist: Akademy 2021
Description: 
	By  TimothÃ©e Ravier
Fedora Kinoite is an immutable desktop operating system featuring the KDE Plasma desktop. It is based on rpm-ostree, Flatpak and podman to create a great user experience with atomic and safe updates for the system (rpm-ostree), the applications (Flatpak) and development tools or containers (podman). Fedora Kinoite is entirely built from Fedora RPM packages which tend to be very close to what upstream KDE is providing.
This talk will explain the goals and advantages with Fedora Kinoite and what is coming next to help KDE developers develop and test upcoming desktop changes more easily.

[Music]

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,759
all right thanks

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,039
so hey welcome everyone um

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,400
so i'm i'm timothev and i

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,680
i work at redout in the chorus team

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,359
mostly on federacares and

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,000
i'll be talking here today about federer

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,480
kenoit

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,079
which is a new version a new variant of

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,559
federal that we're introducing

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,559
with fedora certified so let's get right

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,520
into it

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,920
so first the question is okay why fedora

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,480
why

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
even bother with federal and then why

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,640
even bother doing this

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,200
at all and then okay where are the apps

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,360
and the

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
okay well with everything we'll see a

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,199
little bit about the future and what we

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,239
want to do with that

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,800
so first thing what is federal kin right

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,800
so

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,160
fieldwork in white essentially it's a

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,720
new federal variant

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,080
which is attached to the kde seeing so

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,520
the special interest group

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,479
in the federal community we 100

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,080
federal so nothing in fedorak you know

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,920
right is different from federer it's

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,640
just federal but a little bit with a

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,960
little bit of a

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,320
different twist and we'll see that uh

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,799
coming right away

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,200
uh so yeah it's 100 percent federal rpm

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
packages so it's it's pretty federer

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
the the thing that's different of course

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,000
we're not just building something else

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,400
just for the sake of it

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,240
uh is that it's an immutable this we

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,360
like to call it an immutable desktop not

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,240
in the sense that

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,360
it won't change but that you control how

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,880
it changes

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,200
which is really important like keeping

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,320
control of your computer of course

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,439
and of course we're here at academy it's

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,960
all about tde

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,880
and this variant is featuring the kd

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,119
plasma desktop

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,840
the first release for uh federal united

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,280
spine is planned for fedora 35 so right

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
now fedora 34

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,719
is stable and we are in the development

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,840
of it are 35 which should be

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,080
stable something around october or

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,520
something

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,599
um yeah all right so

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,040
why federal well there are a couple of

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,920
things here that makes fedora

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,080
interesting uh

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,560
as a base for these projects the first

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,560
one is that federal provides a stable

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
and up-to-date software stock so we

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,000
integrate a lot of things

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,040
in fedora where a lot of other source

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
projects uh

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
fresh and uh but stable open source

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
projects

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,000
uh so we a lot of work on wayland we

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,840
have win

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
in the build by default pipeline table

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,040
by default in fedora 34

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
system did use the sessions2 in kde and

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,879
all that

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,000
comes tested and baked into the image by

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,440
default

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,400
um with kde more key focused we

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,120
always try oops but it's still working

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,640
oh sorry

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,599
yeah we always try to follow kd

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,120
packaging

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,400
following getty patching the latest

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,920
release of kd packaging

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,519
and we try to go upstream first uh

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,800
usually so we try to make sure that

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,879
everything apaches

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,959
is upstream first and uh that nothing uh

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,120
that nothing is like only carried by us

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,120
we we also try to keep it

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,120
upstream i'm sorry i've been being a bit

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,760
of trouble i hope you can all see

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,239
still see me and hear me and that should

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,239
be fine

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,080
all right so come on

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,440
ouch all right i'll have to ask you if

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,840
we change slides forward but that should

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,640
be fine

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,720
um and uh all right so

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,879
yeah we upstream first and we we are an

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,000
active uh special interest group so

00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:00,080
we uh we have weekly meetings on monday

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,200
uh around 800 1800

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,319
and uh we we

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,760
yeah we're very active right so what

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,280
makes the difference so

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,040
it's a little bit different from the td

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,959
spin the character kd spin because it's

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,280
based on rpm with three so

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,959
it's a different technology to to manage

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,519
how you you you have your system and

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,000
essentially

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,680
the idea is that instead of managing

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,800
single packages you manage

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240
an image for your operating system

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,479
and you move from one version to the

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,000
other when you update

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,160
uh it's the same technology that's used

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,639
in in in federal course for example

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,199
federal iot and federal civil w2

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,320
uh so that's our chemistry for managing

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
the system and then

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,639
there's flatback where you that you use

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,720
to manage applications so

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,040
the basics about flat pack is that

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,759
instead of inserting applications as

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,080
packages you install them as different

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,880
well

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,199
different package um has flat packs and

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,720
uh

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,560
they can come from different sources so

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
you don't have to to add them from your

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,120
distribution you can have them from

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,440
from something else they could even be

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,600
proprietary or provided by other vendors

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,680
and that's not an issue at all

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,360
and finally when you've got all that

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,560
sometimes you have to do development you

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,919
want to have common line tools and

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,639
things like that and

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,360
everything on fedora unite is using

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,479
containers

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,160
essentially so um to to

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,320
to manage containers we use spot map

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
which is a

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,600
container manager which is very well

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,520
suited for command line tools

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,000
um all right and well with all that said

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,080
uh the the first variant this kind of

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,680
brand that was introduced in fedora was

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,720
favorable silver blue and essentially we

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,639
are really just siblings of the

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,320
reciprocal because we use a lot of the

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,320
same technologies we share a lot of them

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,000
okay so what does it look like well

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
essentially

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,039
it just looks like any regular caddy

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,680
desktop

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,280
like if you just booted a federal tv

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,240
spin and you compare it to a fedora

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,080
keynote spin

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,680
it's essentially the same it looks

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,479
exactly the same because it's the same

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,560
packages

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,319
same software same configuration nothing

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,680
changes except maybe a logo we don't

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,800
have a logo yet but

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,000
in the next in the coming week maybe

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,600
we'll have new logo and

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,520
that will be the only difference

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,720
actually if you look just

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,880
at the at the cover at the top uh

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,280
so here here it is it's it's the fedora

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,039
35 that i freshly booted with recently

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,000
booty

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,800
and uh you just install apps using

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
discover

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,560
just like on regular kd it's just like

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,840
all the only apps well

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,759
mostly the only apps that you can

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,319
install are flat packs

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,840
and uh you've got the same menu the same

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,479
time managers and everything same

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,759
browser

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,199
nothing changes here all right so

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,039
what's the current status of this

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,440
initiative well the official support is

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,440
still in progress so well it's working

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,520
and we already have it's plan for fedora

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,319
35 the first release

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,199
uh we you you can drag on that on the on

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,880
indicate

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,680
a link here we already have the official

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,039
development bills so in federal we call

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,680
that rawhide the the development branch

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,400
which is uh which is like continuing

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,319
development

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,599
and then uh it gets branched for its

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,759
release

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,319
so in october or a little bit before

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,479
october it will be branch for federal 35

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,560
and then we will get our first stable

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,120
rise of federal keynote

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,319
um so right now it's rawhide so it's

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,400
development builds but

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:33,520
it's working and and um

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,120
we i also produce an official build so i

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,720
produce unofficial stable boost for

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,280
fedoras 34 the current

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,240
stable branch um the only difference

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,120
between the

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,680
federal 35 builds and the 34 bills is

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,240
that i do the bills for federal 34 so

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,840
it's not signed by federal key and it's

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,879
not signed but it's not built on federal

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,160
infrastructure it's

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,680
built on my server essentially but

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,520
it's still the same content all right so

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,960
what's the goal behind all that and what

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,360
do we want to do behind

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,319
uh fedora knight and and everything like

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,319
that well

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,120
the main thing is want to create a

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,599
really easy experience for users which

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,440
i think is like the top point priority

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,160
if you don't have users uh

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,479
well it's not worthy of making anything

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,879
well

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,000
most things at all even if it's just you

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,759
but yeah

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,080
like we want to create a good experience

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,440
for users so the first one is

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,919
we use rpms3 to manage them

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,479
to manage a system and make system

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,039
updates

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,039
essentially a non-event the idea is that

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,880
when you update rpms3 it it

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,479
breaks in the background so you don't

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,200
change your system live

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,279
it creates a new version of the system

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,519
and then you reboot into it

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,399
and that's that's the best idea because

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,560
essentially you don't

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,320
you don't have to wait for the supply

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,160
you don't you you don't like

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,920
i have to wait for your computer to

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,000
update before you boot or at

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,000
the shutdown you just do like the it's

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,240
live on the system and we it only

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,480
only takes place when you reboot and you

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,640
just reboot into your new version

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
the base itself is also shipped as like

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,720
one single consistent image so

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,080
you don't get like half things installs

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
or half things

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
uh misconfigure things like that it's

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
just either install or not install at

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
all

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,240
it's atomic it's just one on the other

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,640
you can get mix

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,760
and if for whatever reasons you reboot

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,600
into the new version

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,360
and there's a book like i don't know it

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,279
is not your bug or graphics bag

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,279
and you just just want to go back

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,600
because it's yeah it's your day you

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,000
don't

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
like you have things to do and you just

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,040
go back to the previous year

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
then that's easy you just reboot into

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,519
the previous version it's always there

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
and you keep doing the work while you

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,399
try to figure out why the book is

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,040
report the book or something like that

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,680
so yeah that's the system and our rpm

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,519
stream makes

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,880
managing the system really powerful and

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,080
that's the

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,000
the most of it then there's flatbacks

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,120
and when you use flashbacks you get a

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,920
lot of advantages

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
right right out of the box with the way

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,000
flat packs work

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,440
so the main idea is that you can install

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
any big applications

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,959
just like on their own you don't need to

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,360
update anything on a system

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,519
to make them work and all the life

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,040
cycles of the application is tied to the

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,959
flat tax and that's it

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,519
if there's nothing like ning to system

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,880
and it makes it really easy to update

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,440
application

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,640
install new ones without even bothering

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,800
whether or not it will

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,920
pull any libraries if there will be

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,120
inconsistencies

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,640
or or conflicts or anything that's never

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,279
going to happen with spark packs it's

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,920
either

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,839
they're working or not there and that's

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,800
fine

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,399
so yeah it makes applications updates

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,600
and changes completely independent of

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,279
system updates

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,640
completely independent of the channel

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,920
the changes and everything on the

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,000
desktop

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,760
uh we have two main sources of

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,800
applications with threadbacks

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,880
right now we have we have fab which has

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,399
mixed uh free and open software and

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,640
property software

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,640
and we also have a wrong set of flat

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,880
packs built on federal infrastructure

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,040
and which we only contains uh three and

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,560
uh so software only

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,079
and finally the last piece uh here

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,000
that makes it a great experience is

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,000
toolbox so the idea is

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,279
you you have a new multiple system so

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
you don't you don't

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,360
you well it's not always practical to

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
install it off the

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,399
key tools or command line tools

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,959
something like that on your systems and

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,440
what you want to do probably is do most

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,000
of that

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,920
inside containers and toolbox is the

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,200
best way to make that available and it

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,079
also instantly tenaciously makes all the

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,480
rpm packages from fedora available to

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,279
you

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,320
directly and free of cost really easy to

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,160
use and

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
you can also use toolbox with other

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,519
distributions so

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
essentially you get all the software

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,320
that is packaged

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,480
everywhere inside every single

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,560
distribution uh using toolbox and you

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,240
can run them as graphical application on

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,680
your desktop and it will work

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,160
essentially uh in most cases

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,680
so yeah that's like the last result

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,839
thing but that usually work for most

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,839
things

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,120
uh all right so that's like the basic

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,240
thing we want make

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,240
the user experience great

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,519
great for updates great for install

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,560
access to software

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,240
uh you don't get to miss anything and at

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
the same time you get all the benefits

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,000
of

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,440
easy updates never never having

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,680
fear that something will break if you

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,639
update

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,600
so then all right we have users but most

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,560
of the times we

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,079
we also try sometimes even users try and

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,040
do and test things and

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,880
we sometimes want to as developer ship

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,600
some updated software to use it for them

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,519
to test

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,680
and that's something that's really easy

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,079
to do by to do with the same technology

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,240
so

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,959
the main thing is thanks to rpm3 you can

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,000
actually give updates to your users

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,200
and have them try them just like one

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,200
shot or thing like that

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,040
and then i let them go back to the

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,320
stable versions and that's really easy

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,959
that's something that's really hard to

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
do with

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,079
classic package managers and that's

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,800
really to do with

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,079
rpm stream so you give it you you don't

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,560
give up stability

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,240
and you you you keep everything uh you

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,079
keep everything working while testing a

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,760
new version for example and

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,839
uh that's what you get without families

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,000
three you keeps everything asses

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
in the sense that you get you keep all

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,360
your files you keep all the software all

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,279
the flat packs are still there

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,519
there's still stable versions you just

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,279
stabilize the system and that's it

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,720
and you can always roll back if you've

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,880
got any issues

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,560
um if you want also if you're a

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,320
developer you might be interested well

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,880
if you're a testing

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,880
a tester you might also be interested to

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,839
test new flat packs new versions of flat

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,040
packed apps

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,880
and that's something that's really easy

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,720
to do with flat flat pack too

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,800
because you can have multiple versions

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,519
of the same application install at the

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,519
same time

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,120
and that's not an issue at all with

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,880
strap packs you can switch these two

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,880
inversions easily

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,279
and and install multiple versions in

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,040
parallel so you can always get

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,279
the testing versions in the stable

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,600
version so if any issue comes back you

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,079
can

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,240
just start with this disable one and

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,519
that's it

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,920
uh then uh yeah and another thing that's

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,440
great

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,040
that with flat it's really easy to

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,920
produce flat packs from

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,519
from like pr or the guitar pls for

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,800
example or

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,480
any any kind of pr uh essentially um

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,639
and for so for example you could give

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,720
like uh create a flashback repo

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,320
create a flashback change just one for

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,040
one shape and one fix and have it sent

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,680
to users

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,399
and then the users can try this and like

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,320
make sure that

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,839
by the data the change is correct and

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,360
then and then

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,399
you can match the code uh yeah so i can

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,720
i put a link to

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,519
github action because it's it's a quick

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,399
way to to

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,920
to try and with uh to try and create

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,959
flat packs from

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,839
from that right

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,240
and finally we have developers so if you

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
are

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,519
building on tv working on kde either the

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,399
plasma

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,040
desktop itself or any applications um

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,880
this is

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,480
also a great opportunity for you because

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,440
rpm3 makes you

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,959
um it keeps you in control of what's

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,600
changing on system so

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,000
it enables control chains i like to say

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,240
uh

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,680
it's immutable but you have control over

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,000
what changes

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,440
in the system you can replace any rpm on

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,959
the system so you can you can replace

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,440
any component if you want to

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,639
have some so for example fixes systemd

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,240
you could replace that

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,759
and reboot your system and make sure

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,720
that everything work if for example

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,079
you're working on

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,079
fixing things there and the interaction

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,839
basically somewhere

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,880
and but you could replace any part of

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,040
plasma desktop and and do the same

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,240
you can replace that live too so you

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,800
could apply the change

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,240
like restart your session and that's it

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,000
you're good to go

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,120
there's no constraints there it's just

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,959
um

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,480
essentially uh there are a lot of tools

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,440
to make that available still

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,320
for developers so it's immutable but you

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,399
still get to

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
change it it's just you have full

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,720
control of all

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,320
it changes uh and for whatever reasons

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,079
yeah it's development sometimes we make

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,920
mistakes if you want to go back to the

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,279
version that's stable that should be

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,279
working

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,440
then you can do that you can either

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,680
revert that change that you've made live

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,279
or if your system crashed for example if

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,600
any if you had an issue if you just

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,560
reboot you just go back to the stable

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,199
version and that's

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,079
it all right so there's no rolling back

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,320
packages

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,920
changing or having a broken system

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,399
essentially you're never in a broken

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,639
state

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,399
it's either working or you just go back

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,600
to the previous version that should be

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,079
working

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,519
and and for flat packs it's a little bit

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,360
of the same essentially

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,279
uh so our chemistry is just for the

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
system and flatbacks in fact packs you

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,639
can have

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,000
any environment any frameworks any

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,600
version of python or

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,199
any version of whatever you want

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,880
installed and

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,480
any framework and you will have that

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,279
independently of what's installed on

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,240
system so

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,519
you don't get to you don't have any

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
conflicts of whatever

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,520
uh when you you when you're developing

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,880
for in flat packs because you did you

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,120
just get libraries

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,120
uh from the framework for example uh if

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,600
you build a key application and

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,839
you don't worry about about the

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,360
conflicts about in a system or user

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,120
missing dependencies something like that

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,880
because everything is packaged uh

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,559
everything is selling and will be

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,799
shipped at this

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,959
so yeah it's really liberating to have

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:32,240
that in fact that's um

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:35,600
and um it makes it really powerful

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,440
all right so okay so it's we want to

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,400
make a great experience for users

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,000
uh testers developers so okay well in

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,960
federal united do we

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,640
actually have applications because for

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,760
most of the operating system we need

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,080
both we need like

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,799
uh the the system and win applications

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,679
of course

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,240
uh well the story here is still in

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,200
progress

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,679
so essentially uh we already have flat

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,720
packs of

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,640
fedora so in on they you install most of

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,799
the applications as flat packs

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,320
and uh you already you can already

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,559
install most of the applications that

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
are

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,760
available as flight packs from fedora so

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,679
uh

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,120
right now we have a good selections but

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,600
unfortunately we don't have

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,400
key applications yet in federal because

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,720
we're still

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,559
missing some couple of streaks to make

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,840
them work it's still in progress you can

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,400
follow the status here

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,000
in the issue and uh it's planned for

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,840
fellow s35 i'm

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,919
i'll try to make that happen for ferrous

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,200
35 with the therapy directories of

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,160
course

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,240
um the main idea here is that once we'll

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,960
get all the little things tweaked

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,840
and uh and working uh we'll get all the

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,039
already

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,240
packaged application from fedora

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,640
td package application in fedora uh

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,320
on kinwhite essentially for free so

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,360
we'll get a lot of them

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,679
straight out of the box working

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,000
the main thing to remember is that they

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,600
will be the same version as the one

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,320
packaging fedora because essentially

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,760
they will

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,880
even though they're not strictly built

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,880
from rpms it's the same recipe so

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,720
you'll get flat packs that are

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,919
essentially really looking

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,720
closely closely like to the rpms

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,720
once and it's uh always granted to be

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,160
free in opposite software because fevra

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
is about three in a puzzle software

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,480
but then in the meantime it's good we

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,880
already have a lot of key

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,720
applications available on flat hub so in

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,400
flat hub you get the tone of application

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,679
i don't even remember the name

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,360
the name of the count of the current

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,679
number of applications available in fajr

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,440
but

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,080
it's high uh you'll get either

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,919
well a lot of them and uh we quickly

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,480
expanded the list of kd applications

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,760
available

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,640
for hub you can search uh for

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,799
all the kd applications there and we try

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,679
to follow or with the latest upstream

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,679
release so

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,760
they get updated really really really

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,000
fast when the releases are made

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,440
essentially it's on the day or the next

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,919
day

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,760
um android hub is a great place to do a

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,000
lot of things it's a great place to

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,320
to fix applications and work with app

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
stream kde application developers

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,840
to fix the application that sometimes

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,679
don't really work well with the

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,000
flatbacks unboxing model

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,280
so some some leaders changes are needed

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,240
to make them

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,440
like really work or like pretty i would

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,880
say

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,159
and and yeah there's a lot of

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,360
small tax tasks that are um easy to get

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,240
studied on

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,720
that that are there for for packaging

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,360
either

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,840
existing applications or to fixing some

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,919
some

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
some display issues for some or things

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,640
like that

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,440
so if you look at flat hub right now

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,240
we have like a ton of apps on flat hub

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,840
this is just like

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,520
landing page with some popular

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,080
applications so it's

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,039
mixed there's both on cloud have free

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,240
opposition software

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,640
and proprietary software so you get to

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,799
pick

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,159
which one you want to install but it's

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,880
just to be aware of that

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,880
uh if you charge for all dot key you get

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,760
kd applications which is which are of

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,120
course free

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,880
software but they may come with

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,880
additional specific software that

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,720
sometimes restricted in some places such

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,760
as the ffmpeg or things like that

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,760
for video uh codex or audio codecs

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,240
uh all right so i'm good on time so

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,960
let's see

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,000
what's the fuel of federal knowledge so

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,840
the idea is okay

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,840
that's what's going to happen in federal

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,400
35 in the federal certified site frame

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,880
we'll be close to be too close at that

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,919
uh

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,360
because i'll show you um a running for

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,400
the racket like instance just

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,159
just after that um but what's coming

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,799
next so essentially the plans for the

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,120
future

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,240
is uh that we want to be the next the

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,520
best platform

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,240
to try the next version of kde so either

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,640
key plus

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,760
desktop and all the kd apps we want to

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,880
make sure that

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,360
users developers testers

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,880
everybody can feel safe like testing the

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,679
next version of those

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,679
packages those applications uh easily

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,159
using kinoite while at the same time

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,559
keeping

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,320
working and stable desktop environment

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,200
that's like

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,679
top goal um so the first one is we want

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
to make

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,840
the plasma beta releases available so

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,280
right now

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,960
on on the right branch we always take

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,080
the latest beta as the latest stable

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,880
versions

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,799
but the stable version will always be a

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,679
little bit behind of course

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,760
um so yeah we want to make those

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,720
available in a different way and we want

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,559
to also make

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,919
key applications like pre-released or

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:49,039
likely flat packs of kv applications

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,520
uh easily available to to users there so

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,320
that's

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,360
both work like in federal kind and work

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,360
upstream too

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,919
so we want to work with webstream here

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,880
um to make sure that uh

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,640
everything download stream to to to make

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,960
applications work in five packs will be

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,159
working well um

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,360
[Music]

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:13,360
so on on the there's already uh

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:16,480
upstream um kde and testing versions of

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,440
uh nike versions of gd applications uh

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,200
so that's good and it's i'd say just

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,320
need a little bit of polish

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,880
to make it uh work well uh but the main

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,120
thing here

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,400
so for on the federation right side is

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,520
he we is bringing

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,400
to users like beta versions of kb plasma

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,440
desktop

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,080
really soon we really fast to to the

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,520
for four testers on stable branches and

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,159
this is what we want to do

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,000
in the short term uh so have multiple

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,440
delivery streams so right now we'll we

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,360
you will have essentially

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,559
the restroom for each branch version of

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,080
federal so federal 34 federal 35

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:59,200
and 36 uh coming in next in six months

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,000
uh and um what we want to add is

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,559
uh essentially a new versions that will

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,039
be fit

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,480
very simple so the current stable

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,559
version plus on top

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,080
like the beta versions of the kde plasma

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,480
desktop so you will get like

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,320
a really strong solid stable foundation

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,320
like systemd the kernel

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,679
message the graphic stacks and

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,760
everything firefox

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,960
and then on top you will get like the

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,440
next the

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,039
beta plasma desktop available on the

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,360
nike plus my desktop

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,240
if there's no beta and you can just try

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,480
that and so

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,400
essentially you don't you don't you

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,279
cannot you don't have to fear that for

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,480
example there's a

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,559
bug somewhere in the in the

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,760
fire system driver in the kennel in this

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,840
different version because

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,520
it's still a stable kernel you're just

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,240
using like the nightly pass map and

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
stuff so

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,840
if things crash usually it's just you

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,640
say some question and not everything on

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,279
the system

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,240
and that should be fine uh so again

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,640
that's like

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,320
one we want to create like this specific

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,120
version that makes it really easy for

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,279
users to take the latest plasma release

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,240
on a very strong stable version of the

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,600
system

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,159
and i think that's something that does

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,360
not really exist today um

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,679
and um yeah we we want also to make sure

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,520
that

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,520
everything gets tested before it gets

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,520
released so right now it's we need a bit

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,279
of mix because we do testing

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,240
but sometimes things go to uh go to uses

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,840
and we still have some some some some

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,919
parts missing around testing and we want

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,240
to improve the testing here

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,120
uh yeah and essentially that's it for

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,799
for the

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,159
for the main thing we want to bring and

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,640
that's a big one because

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,320
like enabling users to easily just make

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,679
versions it's like something

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,320
without having to create virtual

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,919
machines uh create have a new laptop on

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,440
the side to do the testing but i

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,320
actually do the testing live

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,320
it is a big thing

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,640
all right so here's the like short

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,039
summary of everything uh well we still

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,159
don't have a logo it's still in progress

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,279
uh this issue to track here i'll share

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,760
the slides somewhere

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,480
oh so it's like to be sure somewhere uh

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
and uh

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,120
yeah if you want to join us for and help

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,799
us do uh on on that journey and

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,600
we're working essentially in the key sig

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,120
and we're working closely with upstream

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,720
uh we meet every

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,360
week on monday uh usually we have a

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,520
very friendly bunch so feel free to join

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,840
feel free to join

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,400
and yeah you can try it right now

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,200
official development bills of iraq and

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,760
right

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,799
uh all the instructions are there it's

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,039
on the federal

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,320
it's on the federal infrastructure uh

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,320
and if you want to try

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,440
civil versions of federation right so an

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,880
official one

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,360
non-official one the one that built

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,600
myself you can go ahead and try

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,360
uh in this link of the theorem maxine

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,760
article

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,880
and yeah i think that's time for a

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,400
little bit of a demo

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,080

and i can't hear anything so because

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:21,840
probably um

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:21,840
i need to fix my sounds

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:35,840

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,559
couple

00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,720
the first question is when will we get

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,720
uh kina for plasma mobile

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:55,840
whoops i don't think should be oh

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,840

is when will we get picking up for

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,520
plasma mobile

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:25,200
uh yeah this is planned this will

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:28,399
come this will come when

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,360
we have all the plasma mobile

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,000
application and changes a little bit of

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,200
tricks

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,240
into fedora i think this packaging

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,240
in progress for that

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,840
all right the other question we have is

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,960
are using keynote as your usual

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,799
operating system

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:58,399
if not what would be missing

00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:01,600
so yeah i am using keynote

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:04,960
on my main laptop and planning

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:09,919
to switch my second computer to it

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,919
once it's released is inferior

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,000
awesome um

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,000
can we offer any help helping to get

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:33,840
that demo up

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:33,840
i'll switch brother again

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,840
okay i could you

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,320
uh yeah not on the other one please

sorry

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,720
yeah thank you sorry it's a little bit

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,720
of a mess because

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,080
it's cool

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:29,840
all right

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,159
yeah one should be better

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,679
i'll try and resize that so that we get

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:43,840
only

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,840
the most interesting part on the screen

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,640
and yeah so this is essentially

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:56,880
fed rocky white it's not squared

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:59,440
but yeah that's twisted

00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
strange

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,080
that's extra weird yeah

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,399
right um

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,360
so it's just regular kitty desktop let

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,840
me well

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,399
let's forget about that i'll share

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,399
something else

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,640
actually share my laptop which is

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,519
running

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,519
fedora kilometer

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:37,279
so yeah here i'm on it's my laptop

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,679
and i'm running fedora 34 so it's the

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,320
inofficial version of it or knight

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,320
and uh

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,720
yeah so you can see here i have two

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,360
versions running

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,880
uh i have two versions installed so i

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,799
always at all times

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,919
you usually have two version installing

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,720
system so the first one here

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,360
is the the version i'm currently running

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,240
it's

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,679
marked by a small dot on the side here

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,559
and

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,639
i have some packages installed on top of

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,919
this version so we have chromium

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,960
i have chrome h-stop anything like that

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,560
and for example and there's a second

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,599
versions underneath which is the

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,560
previous mission

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,320
i had built before so it's this one from

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,520
last week and this one is from two weeks

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,480
ago

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,480
and uh and yeah i could just go back to

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,919
the previous versions if there's any bug

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,000
in this current version

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,359
and i'll do a build like on monday

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,720
something and

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:39,200
i'll simply update a new one there

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,320
so that's essentially rpms3 that you

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,320
manage your system

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,440
and you have one image with all the

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,440
components the

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,960
the the kde desktop and thing like that

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,159
inside

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:53,520
and then you get flat packs so if you go

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,079
try to look at flat packs uh i have

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,880
here a lot of flat packs installed uh so

00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,280
i have slack spotify so proprietary apps

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,280
and at the same time i have inkscape for

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,440
example open source applications and

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,640
some 3d applications there that

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,119
install from fat hub so if i launch

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,119
dolphin

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,240
it's it will run uh yeah i need

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,240
this to do okay

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,560
dolphin oh i have not done installed

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,839
yeah i have to offer install it's just

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,839
with a small d

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,359
uh yeah so essentially if i when i run

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,000
dolphin here

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,599
it's dolphin run has a flat pack so it's

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,440
the latest version of dolphin

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,960
even though i don't have this version on

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,640
my system because um here we're running

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,839
like 21 uh with its

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,240
point one four four

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,520
two and if i run the system dolphin so

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,960
the one that's currently inside of my

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
system it's a little bit behind

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,320
because we have not updated the version

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,640
if there are 34 yet

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,440
uh so you i can run both actually i can

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,839
i could start

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,640
the dolphin classic dolphin one and it's

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,320
just fine

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,160
i'll have the version from the system

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,599
and the one at the flat pack here at the

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,640
same time and they

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,520
just do absolutely the same because

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,800
essentially they the integration is very

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,440
good with flat packs and

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,560
you don't get to see much differences

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,119
there

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,880
and uh we've got a lot of other

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,960
applications we've got some

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,200
the calculator the image viewer it's

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,440
already there the

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,200
extractor and uh yeah

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,720
and classic ones like libreoffice

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,960
firefox thunderbirds and things like

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,960
that

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,760
um yeah i don't know if what should i

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,680
show you

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,560
uh on on the list up here

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,960
um yeah essentially it's federer and

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,920
it's

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,240
a kitty desktop so there's not much to

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,560
to

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,079
show because it's basically behaving in

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,280
the same way

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,280
so right now it's called silver

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,280
blueberries this is just like a perfume

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,560
version

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,160
and yeah and if uh if i was bringing

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,119
uh the horror height version uh you will

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,119
get the

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,240
exact uh latest um we we're right now in

00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,280
rawhide we are using the federal 2522

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,560
the federal the kde 522 releases that we

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,160
have

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,880
25 522 1 release the latest one

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,400
built and available that will be shipped

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,599
to federal 34

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,800
in the coming weeks right

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,800
do we have any questions left

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,680
all right it seems we have a couple

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:58,079
does kde apps come from flat hub by

00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:01,200
default or from fedora flat pack remotes

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,040
by default it's only federal because

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,960
we want to make sure that only free

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,520
software is available by default

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,400
and then you can have flat hub and get

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,400
anything from fatab

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:22,720
all right question i see

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:25,680
is how do you handle things like the

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,000
i'm just going to spell this out n v i d

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,040
i

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,040
a driver

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,920
oh yeah minifigures driver so um

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:42,160
you can get that install hd uh

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,280
it's uh it's it's working now

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,079
it's been working for a couple of

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,119
phrases uh you can get an install

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,920
uh on top of the of the image

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,520
and it will essentially rebuild the the

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,079
camera driver for every

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,960
new version you deploy and yeah that's

00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,960
that's working

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,200
i don't have one in vg card right now

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,200
but i've did testing and it works
