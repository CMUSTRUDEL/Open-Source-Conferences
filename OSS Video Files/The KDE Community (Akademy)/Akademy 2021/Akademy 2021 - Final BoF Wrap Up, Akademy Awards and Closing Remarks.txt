buff wrap up for academy 2021

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,119
this morning in the first session of the

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,640
day

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,239
we had a handful of box and sessions

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,360
that the three of you were a part of

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,800
um some and others

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,559
were part of more yay i see david

that's great um

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,000
i'd also like to ask alice to come back

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,360
because

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,320
he also posted a buff today

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,039
uh getting into it ali she hosted the

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,079
kitty goals all about the app's

00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,760
automation

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,320
would you like to speak to it tell us

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,320
how it went

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:17,200
we're muted yeah sorry about that um

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,400
that was our first buff

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,600
in the morning where we talked with uh c

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,920
satman so we had been doing buffs

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,799
all over the week about different ab

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,240
topics mostly based around the platform

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,560
and well one of the most

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,520
common themes was it would be great to

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,040
automate

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,079
x or y and actually most of the times it

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,399
was

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
all the same thing so we thought let's

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,479
have a

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
discussion with uh this is sandman team

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,280
who

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,200
paul did join and and discuss the

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,680
different uh those different topics

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:59,040
it ended up orbiting around how

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,960
how amazing our life is gonna be when uh

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,520
we embrace gitlab ci

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,040
they are working on it so they kind of

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,679
said

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,000
please wait a little bit and be patient

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,000
it's going to be amazing

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
and then we went through the different

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,760
levels of amazingness

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,800
you can see uh more specific notes if

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
you look at the

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,959
kitty is all about the app's goal chat

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,160
they're not super more specific uh the

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,840
sysadmin team i think i would like to

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,239
think at least that they promised that

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,640
they

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,080
will provide a bit more of documentation

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,879
on what's the status

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,519
of things and how to help them better

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,200
but

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,120
uh well it seems like they have it under

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,319
control so

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,239
well good luck to them and

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,239
to all of us it's gonna be amazing

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
next

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,680
sorry i couldn't find my own button for

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,519
a skit

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,879
um all right thank you alex

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,840
how did your distribution

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,840
uh boss go

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,360
right so uh it fairly naturally flowed

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,400
on from the one previous so

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,640
it was yeah splitting the two uh

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,640
splitting into two was kind of fun but

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,519
um basically the

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,480
idea there also was to try and

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,519
streamline

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,799
the way we get stuff

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,920
actually to end users uh

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,080
in uh in

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
in a way that puts the least amount of

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,879
pressure

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,840
on people effectively

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,360
in other words automation for the

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,280
distribution side

00:03:49,360 --> 00:04:00,080
of of our software production efforts

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,280
um and we came up with a

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
a a sort of procedure that we think

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,680
might work

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,519
which would then uh be tied into how

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,400
gitlab works

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,599
um so that we can kind of use that as a

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
nexus

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,400
so that we have a straightforward

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,240
consistent process where the

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,080
release effort

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,520
from the point of view of someone

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,400
maintaining an app who doesn't

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,400
necessarily

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,040
know how to

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,040
get their software built for 15

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,560
different operating systems and all of

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
that sort of stuff

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
um and get it on stores and so on and

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,880
make that

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,600
as straightforward and sort of

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,880
effortless as possible while still

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
remaining

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,080
safe um so there's a couple of things

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,440
that we can't automate

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,600
because there needs to be a manual

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,000
intervention step but

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,080
there are a lot of things that can be

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,560
and which are

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,560
almost there um and which then

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,400
kind of just need the dots connecting

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,840
obviously there is no such thing as easy

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,600
but um yeah yeah

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,280
there we've we've got a

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
we've got a way forward there and it

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,199
looks really neat so

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,800
yeah and of course the

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,000
details are all in the uh the

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,280
kde all about the apps matrix group as

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
well

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,680
awesome thank you

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,880
okay let's go over to ken

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,720
kenny kenny's this way

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,240
for the kde fundraising working group

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,560
yeah thanks awesome so we mainly focused

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,840
on

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,319
two core themes um one of the core

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
themes

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,919
was the kde 25th anniversary that's

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,520
coming up

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,280
and the opportunities that that's going

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,880
to give us in regard to our fundraising

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,000
efforts so lots of exciting things going

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,960
on there

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,600
and the other theme which was kind of um

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,840
we

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,759
um managed to relate the two was the

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,680
ongoing efforts towards trying to get

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,680
our civic crm instance

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,199
to do what we need it to to be effective

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,400
for the community and what we're doing

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,120
with fundraising

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,600
and i think most of us i think all of us

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,919
in the

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,199
both agreed that civi crm as it

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,919
currently stands doesn't really do but

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,319
it

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,520
doesn't really do what we need it to and

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,000
so we're going to start

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
actively looking at alternatives not to

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,960
replace as a whole i mean it's still

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
doing things like

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,319
super payments fairly well but to look

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,080
at things

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,919
like paypal immigration try to find

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,440
something that affects some of those

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,319
requirements start experimenting a

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,960
little bit

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,759
and then hopefully try to build

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,880
something new

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,400
for the 35th anniversary and we've

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,080
currently got a requirements document

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,880
um that's getting put together just now

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,479
by carl um if anyone wants to get

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,000
involved in that effort you're more

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,240
you're more than free to join you can um

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,319
get in touch via the mailing lists

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,919
we're also going to be um opening up a

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,120
new set of matrix irc channels that

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,520
people can join

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,520
um we're really hoping that by changing

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,880
our tooling and changing technology

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,960
we can try and get a bit more energy

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,479
into the community and use that as a

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,479
driver for

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,479
um improving our fundraising efforts

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,759
all right thank you

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,680
okay next up plasma and promo meeting

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,880
posted by david

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,000
r david r want to take it away

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,120
tell us how it went it went great

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,160
we first the pro

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,520
people explain to us what they want

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,520
their goals with the plasma

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,800
announcements and

00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,479
the general strategy for reaching

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,120
more the public in general

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,280
and then we talked about how we as

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,759
plasma developers can help them make

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,280
their

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,879
process easier and help them make better

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,800
plasma announcement and we we also

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,919
decided that this will release in

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,639
october

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,199
will be called the plasma anniversary

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,000
edition

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,319
and will release on the 25th anniversary

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,840
of

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,840
plasma of kde

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,360
exciting stuff well

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,399
let's go on uh there was a plasma

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,399
bug triage ooh very nice hot david

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,159
would you like to take it away and tell

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,959
us how it went

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,160
yeah so in previous years nobody really

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,000
likes doing bugs

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,080
so if you lock everybody in a physical

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,839
room that generally helps here we had a

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,640
virtual equivalent

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,240
and the idea was to go through and we

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,440
went through all of the lists of all the

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,399
bugs

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,680
practice very high priority i went

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,200
through which forms

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,040
actually were and when going through

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,440
as a group making sure everyone in the

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,440
core plasma team had an awareness of

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,760

workshop for the topic

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,880
today we discussed about passing

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,079
arguments of typelist

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,720
passing list of custom python data

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,800
objects and parsing the data on cue on

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,519
the qml side

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,920

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
from

custom python data objects and finally

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,839
properties

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,519

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,880
nothing more apart from the

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,679
i get to do the closing talk as well so

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,520
okay

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,520
but if you you can show yourself at this

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,080
point right um

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,080

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,039
here

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,240
thanks for showing them the way

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,640
this is all live so no one knows the

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,080
well only

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,840
like a limited number of people knows

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,720
about the awards before the awards so

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,720
this is all live

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,400
hello hello hello yeah my screen

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,679
is over there and my webcam's over there

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,600
so this that makes things

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,600
a little difficult okay

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,520
we will minus yeah yeah

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,840
i was going to show off another very

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,840
yellow t-shirt that i have

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,240
but now you've you've completely spoiled

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,520
all my setup

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,640
i'm sorry i appreciate it hello paul

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,039
hello paul

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,280
welcome all right

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,080
it's interesting because the moment when

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,799
you were saying

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,840
i wasn't actually in the room uh my son

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,559
from the other

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,600
room said oh congratulations and i said

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,280
for what

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,919
because i was i was telling alexander

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,400
alexander congratulations i went into

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,200
the chat

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,679
i wanted to chat to tell him here one

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,600
and

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,039
uh because he didn't know either and he

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,080
was doing his own thing

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:32,240
so uh i went to say alexander

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,360
come you you won a reward and that is

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,679
when you announced

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,360
that i had won this award so i did he

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,960
didn't hear his and i didn't hear mine

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,159
because i was telling you

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,320
that seems legit okay um

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,600
we have alexander who as you said

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,520
already joined

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,440
alexander you just need to change the

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,960
way you are connected from the

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,600
speaker only to uh listener only to

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,039
speaker

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,720
also you just need to click the

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,200
interface is a bit that's

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,080
the only a bit awkward think of big blue

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,159
button

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,400
uh or the things that people notice most

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,840
i think it's also partly the surprise

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,240
you get to say something to

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:15,280
all those viewers out there yeah

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,600
he's doing that so we can see all live

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,600
right

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,159
if we start planning for a physical

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,960
academy in 2022 already

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,320
then we need to figure out where the

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,400
three jury members should meet

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,480
i mean paul is in the south of spain so

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,880
that's a nice place to head to

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,000
but maybe alexander has an even nicer

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,000
location to offer us

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,919
hi guys can you hear me yes

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,320
i just rejoined so let me check that i

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,320
can manage to activate my camera

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
um

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,320
i'm here hi hello everybody hello hello

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,240
so we are hello everyone so yes it's a

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,039
bit surprising for me you know i was

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,039
joining my uh so the end of my very busy

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,320
week and i started paul so this was

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,320
again i think a

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,000
spanish red wine you know so i was

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,000
joining my evening and then paul is

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,200
writing to me alexander congratulations

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,400
and i was

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,400
what what's going on here if you could

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,120
give me a short summary of what has

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,200
happened you know

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,520
short background short context so i can

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,200
put the news into the proper context

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,799
would be great so i didn't sorry i

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,360
didn't manage to go through the recent

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,799
news and

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,360
recent communication yes

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,720
so this is a application award uh for

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,480
the academy

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,400
which is the community award we give

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,159
every year from the community to the

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,000
community and we have three categories

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,600
so you want the one for the application

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,159
award for the work on

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,159
lab plot

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,880
so that's thanks for all the work there

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,720
uh it's one of the small

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,039
jewels that maybe people don't know too

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,880
much but still

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,080
you want to share something now that's

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,799
the time for the

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,159
some speech smalls yes maybe so let me

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,080
let me maybe spend some

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,919
uh somewhat some time talking about this

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,320
so yes it's a jewel you know but

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,679
and not so many people know about this

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,279
okay but we are in the process of

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,799
changing this and i think so with the

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,880
help of people like you know

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,080
like what i mentioned last time during

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,760
my talk at the

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,360
linux app summit so there are many

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,880
people behind the scenes contributing

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,080
also to this okay and then people like

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,919
paul and

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,960
people doing you know all the ci stuff

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,320
and so on and so on writing

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,000
documentation so there are many people

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,919
contributing to the success of our

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,919
people okay so this is not only

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,360
the work of the core developers but of

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,360
all these contributors you know this is

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,400
the advantage of being part of

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,600
such a community okay it's not a

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,360
result of a contribution of one or two

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,440
persons okay so there's a whole

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,440
community behind this so this award is

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,799
not only going to us a regular game so

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,720
thank you of course for this for this um

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,240
for this decision okay but it's not only

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,679
us okay so it's at the end it's the

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,200
whole community so there are many people

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,679
contributing to this directly in the

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,080
rate

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,720
indirectly so there's so there are many

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,720
people uh

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,000
responsible for this for this success so

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,919
to say okay so

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,760
but um yes of course a very surprising

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,159
result thank you all for this okay

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,679

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,559
we will be able to continue um

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,919
working on this you know to keep this

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,200
high bar of

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,799
of whatever goals and desires we set for

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,520
us for this application so

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,600
um i think this is just the beginning

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,000
for us

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,440
thank you everybody thank you thank you

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,159

that's a wonderful sentiment it is the

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,000
community that makes things possible

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,360
and i see and i see fabian fabian

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,039
commenting here they chat you know so

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,200
maybe for people who don't know this so

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,919
fabian fabin was one of our jesus

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,720
students

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,039
two three four years ago then he next

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,039
year he even mentored so he

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,039
stopped being student okay he was done

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,440
with the university and then so next

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,000
year he became already a mentor

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,919
kd mentor so he met with another student

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,120
so now he disappeared for one two years

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,640
but i hope

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,720

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,240
dinosaur here which is a good thing um

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,000
i i have in my hand a business card a

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,799
kde business card from

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,880
2008 i think when i was on the board

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:35,840

thank you for the recognition i

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,039
believe that this is also just a trick

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,480
really by by you and the academy

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,679
organization to make sure that i'm

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,760
around next year

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,840
and actually do something do one of the

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,399
things that i promise to do because

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,159
that's

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:04,240
okay it's suspect that's interesting

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,600
no we did we decided totally in a

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,640
separate way so

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,399
i can assure you that that's but so

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,520
thanks again for all the

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,760
those years of service and let's see

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,880
that they are not the last ones so they

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,080
will continue

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,279
again so thanks again and

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,320
so someone from the uh organization team

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,279
so i'd like to leave the screen to them

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,520
to

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,399
for them to say something so that they

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,600
can live

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,240
happily and make sure things are going

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,520
to the

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,200
natural conclusion today yeah people are

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,440
calling the candies

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,440
so

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,480
i suspect that the thing they're going

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:54,000
to say is and

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:57,760

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,760

let's see if i see some movement so

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,960
something is happening so maybe we will
