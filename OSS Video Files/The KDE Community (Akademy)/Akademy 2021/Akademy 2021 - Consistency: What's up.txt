[Music]

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,519
i gave you the presenter role

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,359
and yeah exactly on time let's welcome

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,560
nicola with his presentation

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,800
take it away okay thank you so

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,320
hi everyone and as you can see this is

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,080
my presentation and

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,519
that's pretty much it because this is

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,359
the only slide but

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,559
before we get into it the actual slide

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,600
let me say a few words about myself i

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,440
am nikola venerandi the leader of the

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,520
consistency goal as you might

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,920
know at this point and i also have

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,120
like a youtube channel where i post

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,000
stuff about kde

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,360
which you can find by googling nikola

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
vey on youtube

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,320
and i'm also in the vdg and promo

00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,559
rooms for you know promotion stuff and

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,440
that kind of the sort of stuff and i

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,039
want to share

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,879
with you a video that i've done

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,159
regarding consistency it was

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:12,400
published yesterday on my channel

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,880
so just give me a second that like this

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:26,480
and we should all see it together let's

00:01:14,880 --> 00:02:19,169
try it

00:01:26,480 --> 00:02:19,169
[Music]

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,360
okay and that was it let me actually get

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,640
back to the presentation

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,280
and i've seen some people saying

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,400
let's hear that youtube doesn't block

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,879
the music but

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
actually this music is done by a kd

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,400
contributor so

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,160
it's it comes from kitty itself and i

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,440
think that's really cool

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,519
so i've said that this is my only slide

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,680
but uh that's actually a light

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
because there's a second slide let me

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
get to that one

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
it's completely empty so i thought that

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,040
it didn't count

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,680
so the first the thing that i wanted to

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,000
talk about

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,680
mainly about consistency is design

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,959
consistency or

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,879
why how do we design something that's

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,000
as complex as a desktop while

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,080
keeping things consistent pretty much so

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,400
what we do is that we get to the

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,040
whiteboard and we get a pen like this

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,319
let me try it out

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,599
and of course it

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:33,840
broke just before

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,840
just give me a second i know this

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
hello i'm back i hope you hear me

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,879
of course everything breaks when you

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,920
actually try to use it but still

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,239
hi and so

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,239
as i was saying we get to the drawing

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,280
board and what we try to do

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,560
is draw something that should represent

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,760
our desktop environment

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,080
while not actually drawing anything

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,959
from the desktop environment i'll give

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,519
you an example

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,480
so something that we might want to draw

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,159
is like

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:18,959
this thing like this

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:22,400
and this could potentially be anything

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,960
of course and this is the most general

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,199
uh concept that we have that should be

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,759
applied everywhere in the desktop

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,280
and mostly what we get from these is

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,360
around the corners

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,800
so we know that our design is going to

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,000
have rounded corners

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,120
regardless of what it's applied to and

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,440
if we decided

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
if we decide how much rounded should the

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,400
corners be

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,080
then that is going to be the design

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,360
that's going to be used everywhere

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,160
so this is the most general idea that we

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,320
can draw

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
on a whiteboard without actually going

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,759
into the actual use cases

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,320
and then we can decide to take that

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,280
concept make it a bit bigger so you can

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,759
actually say it like this

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,160
and then uh try to apply it to something

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,039
a bit more specific like windows or

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,680
upless could be anything still at this

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,240
point

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
so of course if it's windows you we

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,160
might want to have a title

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,759
some buttons some other buttons and

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,759
usually at the top you have like the

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,479
most general buttons regarding the

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,160
content

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,639
whereas in the content you have the

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,440
action themselves and

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
the content of course so we want we

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,160
might want to take

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,280
all of the title information about the

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,440
thing itself and general actions

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,360
and includes them in a

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,120
separated design element which is going

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,400
to be a header

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,120
like this and right now we still don't

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,440
know

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,800
what this header is going to be used for

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,120
it could be anything but

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,639
of course if we have a header we might

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,600
as well get a footer because

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,280
we might want to have some actions and

00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,919
information that are at the bottom such

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,440
as you know

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,600
the status bar or informs actions that

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,960
are actually closer to the thumb of the

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,160
user

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,600
so we also get a footer

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,240
and what we've seen is that it's also

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,720
really useful to have a sidebar so that

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,520
you have

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
a central content but also some site

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,319
content

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,720
that helps you understand or navigate

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,880
through the central content so

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,840
like this and then you have actual

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,880
content

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,360
here so this is the most general

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,319
idea i could think of for desktop

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
environment

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,639
and the question is where do we use this

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,680
and

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,720
before the consistency goal every

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
element had like

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,039
its own design but now this simple

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,639
design is used pretty much everywhere

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,840
if you look at all uplets they use this

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,319
design

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,319
or if you go look at i don't know

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,639
not apples but windows

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
we now use this design with the other

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,759
footer the sidebar

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,120
there are still some tweaking to be done

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,720
in application like

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,520
dolphin where the sidebar is um inside

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,319
um either not divided by the line on the

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,120
right or

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,240
inside of a frame so that's something we

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,360
are working on but

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,919
the general the general idea is this one

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,960
and we also use it in dialogues

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:32,000
or the stuff you call when you actually

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,080
pop up overlay sheets sorry they're

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,479
called overlay sheets in kurigami

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,440
so you got the thing that pops up and it

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,599
has the header

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
the footer and the content it does not

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,759
have a sidebar

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,080
yet but it's mostly because it's smaller

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,319
than

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,199
other components so usually we don't

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,440
need it

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
so this is the first component that we

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,639
can think of

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,879
and then we might say sure this is cool

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,039
and we can draw a lot of things but

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,000
when you actually draw the content you

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,199
might want to have some

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,919
preferred kind of content which could be

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,199
i don't know

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:08,000
clicked focused hovered there are many

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,599
uh stuff that should indicate that the

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,720
user is interacting

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,039
with that specific type uh

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,840
smaller content in the general content

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,639
window

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,520
so what we've done is that we got back

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,960
to our

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,400
four lines with rounded corners

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,840
and we said okay so we want the content

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,320
that the user is interacting with to be

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,440
more visible so we are going to give it

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,360
a different color

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,839
and we choose the highlight color which

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,839
is blue

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,240
of course you can change it if you don't

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,920
like blue for any reason

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,720
and i won't say that blue is the best

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,240
color but it

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,800
is so please don't and we are going to

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,680
have

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,640
a solid blue outline plus a bit of

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,120
transparency

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,880
in the inside so that it pops up even

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,040
more if it was just the outline

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,600
wouldn't be so visible and now you have

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,200
here like the icon that you're selecting

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,480
or stuff like that

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,680
and just like this we have a design for

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,800
windows or stuff like that and a design

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,040
for

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,880
content that the user is interacting

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,680
with or stuff like that

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,200
now there's an issue with this if you

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,680
actually try to make this

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,000
in the panel as you know plasma has a as

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,480
i hope you know plasma has a panel

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,480
so you have like an icon another icon

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:37,760
another icon another icon

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:40,480
the plasma icon plus the task manager

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
you amount to that

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,320
things no because we actually

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,600
specific so we can just draw it like

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,360
this

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,880
and and so i'm not drawing particularly

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,600
pretty but

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,480
and the issue is that it doesn't look

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,959
good

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,399
and the reason it doesn't look good is

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,560
that we've got a frame

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,600
which is the panel and inside of it that

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,079
and inside of it there's even another

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,399
inner frame i hope everything is going

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,600
wrong with the

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,920
presentation and inside of it

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
there's another frame which is the

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,839
highlight

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,839
so this is an issue and it's

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,880
why we designed another kind of

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,680
highlight

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,680
which is this one

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,320
so the outer line became a strong blue

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,720
line

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
at the top and then there's transparent

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,640
bluish

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,440
in the center and just like this we have

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,560
designed

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,320
a new highlight like this which

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,040
fits much better into smaller flames

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,360
but now we have an issue we started off

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,560
with

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,519
a cool concept of how to indicate that

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,560
content is being highlighted and now we

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,519
have two

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,399
so when do we use one and when do we use

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,480
the other

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,079
so what we need to do right now is step

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,240
back and think

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,519
when do we use this one and when do you

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
use this one

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,000
and the best idea to discriminate

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,120
between these two

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,800
is to say okay this one is going to the

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,880
left is going to be used

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,880
when there's a big frame and we're

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,519
selecting just one content

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,399
inside a big frame whereas the one in

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,440
the right

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,000
it is to be used when there's a smaller

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,040
frame

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,279
that has a side near the highlight

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,800
the highlight is going to attach

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,519
visually using

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,360
this blue line to that side and the

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,720
highlighted element which looks simply

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,680
prettier

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,959
and that's very fair we now have an ida

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,920
highlight as well

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,880
and now that we have two components like

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,360
this we can

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,240
move on and actually apply them and here

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,839
we have the

00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:00,320
first success story

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,320
applets

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,320
during the first few years of

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,040
consistency we

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,839
completely redesign pretty much all

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,680
outlets

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,839
so if we think that you know we've just

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,800
decided that the general look is going

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,160
to be this one

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,079
so let's draw it as an example

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,160
and then we might want to have a sidebar

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,920
so let's add the sidebar as well

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,399
and of course the header so let's add

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,760
that one the header is going to have

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,839
a title some actions some

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,519
minor actions and then there's going to

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,200
be the content

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,399
like this and maybe at least to the left

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,959
because why not

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,880
and maybe one of the content is going to

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,279
be highlighted so it will have the

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,200
consistent highlighted we decided on and

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,800
maybe also release will be highlighted

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
so it will be like this

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,279
and if you look at this if you think

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,440
this is the highlight the content

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,959
i don't know i didn't draw it perfectly

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
but this is the calendar

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,639
this is exactly the design of the

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,079
calendar if you open it up

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,959
the newest we just redesigned it so of

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,959
course this is

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,320
not what we've done when we decided to

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,040
redesign the calendar

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
but that's the general general idea

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,440
behind it

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,560
heather content highlights and before

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,880
the redesign

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,040
it was not like that the highlight was

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,760
uh didn't have on the corners

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,600
it was just filled and there was no

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,839
sidebar no either stuff like that

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,040
it wasn't it was inconsistent with the

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,000
rest of the hublets

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,639
but now it is and if we draw another one

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,880
this time i don't know a bit taller

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:46,000
and wider and add rounded corners

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,120
we can have the header the title actions

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,519
maybe a footer with other actions and

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,199
this

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,000
is pretty much all widgets of the system

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,600
tray

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,680
the system tray looks like like this

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,800
there's usually usually also a list

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,279
with one element being highlighted and

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,560
that's

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:08,399
i don't know sanduplet or

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,600
the volume one that i just said the same

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,519
thing i meant to wi-fi

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,560
sorry or the clipboard or

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,240
etc i could go on so we took up let's we

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,440
took some general concept

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,519
that we had and we applied them for all

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,160
outlets and now their consistency

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,160
just like magic but of course it's very

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,399
pretty when things go well but

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,480
they can also go wrong so let's start

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,480
actually a few year

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:40,720
story of one time where we screwed up

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:45,040
and that is views

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,320
uh sorry views

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,959
and specifically switching between them

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,480
so let's take an example application

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,120
that we decided

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,880
was going to have this look and let's

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,760
see okay so

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,279
as an application maker i want to switch

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,880
between views

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,199
and the header as i said and

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,079
maybe a footer now let's stay with other

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,519
foot right now

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,600
but we have some content and i want to

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,279
implement something to switch pages as

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,839
as an example if you have a clock

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,480
you want to switch between the arm pages

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,639
the

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,760
time zone settings stuff like that

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,519
switch between them

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,720
that's very simple and what with this

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,480
what we've uh thought about is uh we can

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,759
do something like

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,320
making a list of all views

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,519
in the header and then you can just

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,839
switch between them

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,720
and the current header is going to be

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,839
highlighted

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,440
with the all run rounded corners

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,120
highlight which makes sense you have the

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,279
bigger frame which is the other

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,120
and inside of it the smaller frame which

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,120
is the selected view

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,279
and this is a possible design let's call

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,199
it a and then there's also another

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,639
possible design

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,000
let's make this one with rounded corners

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,959
sorry these rounded corners are not that

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,600
pretty

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,000
and same thing as before but now we are

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,079
actually

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,079
on the phone and when you are on the

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,720
phone you want actions to be close to

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,759
the user

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,160
so we thought okay so the views need to

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,560
be

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,759
on a footer because that's closer to the

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,800
user thumb

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,680
so same thing and we put the list of

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
views

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,880
but now there's a problem the footer has

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,160
just the views which means that it's a

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,399
frame with

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,000
a smaller frame inside of it which would

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,279
be the highlight so we need to use the

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,959
other one

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,600
so not this look but the other look

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,040
which is

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,800
the one like this is it working

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,360
like this and this is option b

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,399
they're both valid options and we

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,320
basically need to

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,399
choose whether we're going to use this

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,120
highlight or this one

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
and at the end like we discussed a lot

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,680
and

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:05,679
eventually b1 and this is the current

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:09,839
design of the component that manages um

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:13,360
swiping between views which is called a

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:17,520
swipe navigator sorry and

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,919
then we actually take a kd application

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,760
and say okay so we have this component

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,480
which is the

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,520
view navigator we we which we just

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,960
designed

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,200
and looks good and let's go see

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,280
how it's actually used because in theory

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,400
we have this flowchart which is

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,400
we design something

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:47,840
i'm too fast for the design

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,840
and then we actually do a component

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,760
like this and finally we use it

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,640
so in this case the design part of it

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,080
was very confused because there was

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,000
no clear consensus and even in the mr

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,080
that introduced the swept navigator

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,559
there were some criticism

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
but still we introduced a component next

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,440
step

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,240
we need to use it if you actually go to

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,720
see

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,280
um plasma mobile applications like the

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,600
clock

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,400
you will see that he had like this like

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,520
the

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,400
the views uh represented by three

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,200
icons three as an example icons with

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,120
labels

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,520
under them and in order to show that

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,799
they're

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,600
active they don't use our swine

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,799
ambiguator

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,000
they use a different color and they say

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,080
okay you know that this

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,039
is the active view because it's blue

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,440
instead of gray

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,880
which makes sense it was a possibility

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,120
and problem is

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,080
is not the component that we've just

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,120
designed

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,400
like five minutes ago so what happened

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,880
is that the component that we've done

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,760
didn't fit the needs of the people

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,799
actually making

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,559
ups and that's a big issue and i think

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,520
the big issue here is that

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,039
we left with a confused design state

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,360
because we didn't

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,240
discuss enough even with the people that

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,799
were going to

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,480
create the apps using the component and

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,640
the result is that

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,880
those people didn't use the component

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,840
that we had just created for them

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,200
and more importantly they have decided

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,160
to

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,080
show that a view is active using a

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,799
different color for the text and the

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,600
icon

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,520
and if you go back to the three kind of

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,280
highlights that we discussed

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:43,520
which was this one and and then

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,640
this one in no way you did we say

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,120
sure let's also change the color of the

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,799
icon

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,559
end of the text that's something that

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,480
was not discussed and

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,240
surely it was not in the mock sub

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,280
mockups and stuff

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,720
so when it actually came down after all

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,320
of this discussion to actually

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,240
implementing something

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,919
what we implemented is completely

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,640
different to the components we have

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,919
and what we've discussed and this is not

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,159
to say that

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,440
up makers got is wrong obviously they

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,400
didn't get it wrong

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,159
if they use this look it means that they

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,559
look that we had designed for them

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,679
didn't fit them and that's an issue on

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,559
our site

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,159
so what we can do regarding this is go

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,280
back to the whiteboard

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,120
uh fetch those um contributors of

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,000
application that should be using this

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,919
component

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,200
and tell them okay let's try to figure

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,480
something together

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,760
that both is pretty for

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,039
your applications and also

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:47,200
works uh you know actually works

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,240
and also fits our consistent design idea

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,240
that we got

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,600
since the beginning which is having

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,600
these two kind of

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,120
highlights and uh that's pretty much it

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,440
for this web navigator

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,320
so this is an issue that we are working

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,200
on

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,320
because it's not nice to only say what

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,280
we've done right

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,919
let's also say what we've done wrong so

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,360
next

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,280
topic is what we can do not just to have

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,679
some design consistency but

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:23,120
also to have code consistency and

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,120
my main takeaway here is components

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,640
i gotta say that i will not use big blue

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,760
but

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,440
as a way to make art from now on

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,000
okay components and uh the thing is that

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,039
when

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,080
we do something that we realize could be

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,600
used in many parts we should do a

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,480
component that

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,679
will make it actually able to be used

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,640
multiple times

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,559
and let's see a couple of examples when

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,640
we got this right and a couple of

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,159
examples when we got this wrong so the

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,360
first example of

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,919
i was getting it right is the amburger

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,600
menu

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:12,000
which has just recently

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:15,360
landed into plasma and burger

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,720
and that is we have this issue which is

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,679
kde as some complex applications even

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,080
simple applications like pdf viewer or

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,320
file manager are actually very complex

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,000
and we need a way to present it so that

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,120
it's consistent

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,480
and easy for the user and we've done the

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,520
hamburglar menu

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,120
which is like adaptive so depending on

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,080
what you have on your toolbar

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,600
we change it we change the content of

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,480
the umbrella menu

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,360
and it also allows to hide and show the

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,400
menu bar

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,039
and it also allows to look through

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,000
all applications so it empowers the user

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,200
to actually

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,880
have a simple um layout by default

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,960
but also being able to use all

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,960
functionalities of your application

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,400
and it's a component that can be used

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,480
anywhere on

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,679
q widgets applications of course we

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,320
cannot like

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,600
expect a third third-party applications

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,919
to

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,000
like this like adapt our components like

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,159
it won't happen but we can do our best

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,520
to be consistent throughout

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:25,600
audition another example if big

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,000
button lets me draw it is the hud

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
which is that very new component that

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,799
pops up when you control

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,960
alt i and it's basically a search

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,320
box when you actually search through the

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,960
actions and

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,520
it's it solves exactly the same issue as

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,840
before

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,279
but complex application we need to break

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,240
it down in an easy

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,880
way for the user and we let the user

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,039
search

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,000
between actions and that's really useful

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,720
and this component

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,159
can be used everywhere in q widgets

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,440
applications

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,760
and the third one which i actually

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,880
forgot

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,919
oh yes sorry sorry which i had forgotten

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,000
about

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:12,960
is the expand

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,360
expandable expandable tooltips

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,559
which is even newer i think i saw it in

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,840
the last uh

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,840
blog post from nate

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:28,240
yesterday and what is that no

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:31,440
last week sorry and what this does

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,559
is basically you hover an element you

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,600
will get a small tooltip saying what

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,400
that element is

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,720
and then press shift to learn more and

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,279
you

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,279
press shift you get a bigger pop up

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,919
saying okay this element is to be used

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,960
for x

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,320
it works like y and so on and again

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,000
that's because we have complex

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,440
application that we need to break down

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,080
in a simple way to the user

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,760
so if a user don't recognize an icon

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,200
just move the mouse over it

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,200
wait for the tooltip and then press

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,520
shift to see all the content in the

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
tooltip and this is consistent

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,960
throughout kde applications so

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,520
this we've done right so uh as

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,840
for things we've done wrong of course

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,360
the

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,279
swipe navigate for

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,679
us into that list and um

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,520
it kind of goes into that list because

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,640
in this this time we actually have the

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,720
component

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,559
the problem is that apps are not using

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,600
it so that's an issue

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:36,400
and another one is

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,400
chats like this

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:44,320
and the issue with chat is

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,880
that we are currently working on at

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,080
least

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,960
three or four chat applications and

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,840
if you look at them chat bubbles as an

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,640
example

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,000
they all are different and that's very

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,919
annoying because you're doing

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,360
the same thing with the same concept

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,799
displaying messages

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,760
and they all behave differently what we

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,480
should do is try to do a component

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,000
like a chat bubble as an example that

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,360
can be used throughout

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,480
kde chat applications and that would

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,440
make sense it's

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,080
just an idea just to represent the bad

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,760
side of it

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,880
that's the good side and bad side of

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,039
course it's more difficult you can

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,120
it will take more effort to do it but

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,720
maybe at the end it will be

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,000
worth it so and regarding

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,559
components uh i wanted to say that

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,400
there's

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:41,200
a billion dollar mistake that was

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,240
introduced in computers that killed

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,919
consistency

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,880
and that is the control c and control v

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,200
shortcuts because now every time that

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,440
you want a component that's from another

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,000
application you just you know copy paste

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,600
make it work and that's it and what you

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,960
do in that way

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,200
you introduce a redundancy

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,320
in the code and if you change your

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,080
component

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,919
it's going to be different from the one

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,000
you just copy pasted from

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,960
which means that different applications

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,600
will have

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,960
the same design elements maybe copying a

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,039
bit from each other

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,559
but there will they will be

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,000
fundamentally different

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:25,919
and that kills consistency as a whole

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,919
how much time do i have left

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,799
and next thing is wallpapers

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,679
so let's actually type down wallpapers

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,919
and this is the final point and then i'm

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,919
done

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,039
and the thing is wallpapers you might

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,799
say

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,720
yeah sure they're just something that

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,960
stays in the background and should be

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,240
pretty enough to ignore it

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,360
they're not because they also from a

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,480
promotional point of view uh give

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,399
um a feel to

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,279
your desktop so if we go from

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,480
one style of wallpapers to a completely

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,760
different one

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,799
we lose that look and consistency and

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,159
that's why

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:21,120
pretty much all plasma 5 wallpapers

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,000
are all based on this simple design

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,240
element

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,200
which is the triangle if you look at all

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,120
of them they're

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,600
all made from triangle except

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,799
one that's hexagons but we don't talk

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,200
about that one

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,080
so triangles everywhere and that was our

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,320
look and feel

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,320
and it pretty much roughly stayed the

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,799
same throughout plasma 5.

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,399
but now we actually want to change our

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,120
look because once in a while

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,120
it's worth it and we are doing a

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,320
wallpaper contest

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,799
for plasma 5.23 so

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,440
stay tuned because in a few days we will

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,720
announce

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,440
our on our twitter and social media that

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,480
there will be a wallpaper contest when

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,039
where everyone

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,159
will be able to send their own

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,080
wallpapers

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,399
and maybe be selected for plasma 5.23

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,440
there will be three winners that will

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,200
get three months

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,080
free of uh blender cloud which is

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,919
uh both a learning tool and also is full

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,159
of assets to learn

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,960
more about 3d rendering so it's a big

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,080
opportunity

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,320
for artists to expand their knowledge so

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,520
if you're an artist and you want to

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,880
characterize

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,279
look and feel of wallpapers this is

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
something that might interest you and

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,240
that was actually

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,840
pretty much it so let's delete

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,200
everything and say

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:55,840
the final thing which is

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:55,840
oh yes

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:03,840
hello hello nicolas so

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,679
we have two questions for now so the

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,880
first one is more like

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,720
um a comment but also a question

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,159
from felipe is uh is about like

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,799
talking about components we should

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,279
definitely have a kirigami.settings page

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,480
or

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,480
something like that yes i totally agree

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,960
and it's never enough components in my

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,799
opinion someone will disagree especially

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,080
those that have to maintain those

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,120
components

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,000
but if you have a specific idea of

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,279
either how it should look or behave then

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,159
try to write it down

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,200
there's the hig documenting the sort of

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,880
stuff those

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,919
so that's something that can get you

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,960
started and then you can actually try to

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,760
contact like

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,320
either vdg or trying to find a developer

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,679
if you

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,880
don't know how to implement it in qml

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,600
for kirigami

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,519
and if you know how to implement it then

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,760
we can just discuss it and then you can

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:03,039
get started

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,960
okay um thanks so there is another

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,519
question from marco

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,279
asking are there cases where there is

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,600
too much consistency

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,799
for example uh cases where things are

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,559
showing up

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,000
are shown upon a visual model that

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:19,120
doesn't completely fit

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,399
and become confusing how to spot them

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,399
so yes there is uh which is something

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,760
that i don't usually talk about for

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,720
reasons and as a practical example of it

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,440
if you open up

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,600
kickoff right now bottom left you will

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,399
see that it has a blue line to indicate

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,720
that's it

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,840
it's active and then next to it there's

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,240
the task manager

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,120
where you have the top line but also the

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,399
blue

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,880
um background over it and the reason

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,240
is that it would be in my opinion very

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,880
confusing to have both

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,840
kickoff open with that highlight and the

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,559
task manager

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,039
with your open window with highlight

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,440
because

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,279
the highlights should indicate the one

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,679
content you're interacting with

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,480
and instead it's true or something like

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,320
that it

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,720
simply doesn't look good which doesn't

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,279
mean that we won't do it in the future i

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,480
think that

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,440
marco himself proposed to do it it would

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,720
be fair

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,519
but uh it's just an example to show that

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,519
sometimes

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,360
it might be an issue to use the same

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,080
exact thing everywhere

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,039
and of course the real question is when

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,080
do we spot

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,320
those cases and it's not easy at all

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,120
and there of course isn't just one

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,480
answer for

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,960
everything and we need to go case by

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,080
case

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,679
and of course try to ask to actual

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,880
users uh hey this is our design

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,720
can you navigate through it or

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,279
does this consistent ui element confuse

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,000
you

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:53,840
that's the best i can think of okay

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,279
there are no other questions right now

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,600
uh are there any

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,720
i guess there are several buffs going

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,880
which will uh

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,120
be in the during the next days do you

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,200
remember some specific dates

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,399
something you want to advertise even

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,279
more

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,000
uh right now actually no because i

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,799
haven't yet set up the consistency book

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,919
because

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,480
i'm a terrible goalkeeper but except for

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,960
that

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,760
the actual date will pop up shortly i

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,120
think

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,799
and then we'll have a nice both so stay

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,960
tuned i think that

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,880
both are mostly for people that are very

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,519
interesting in the topic so

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,000
if you go to the above page and you

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:39,840
press

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,840
f5 tomorrow it should be there

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,480
