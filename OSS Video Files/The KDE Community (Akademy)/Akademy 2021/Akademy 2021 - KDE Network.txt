00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,320

i'm also part of the kde network

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,840
advisory committee

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,719

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,920
member of the kitty ev

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,239
with me today we have anika kokar one of

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,239
the founding members of kde network

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,480
thomas canabrava he has been very active

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,600
in engaging the kde network chapter in

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,240
brazil

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,560
and eshoya kk she is actually led one of

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,560
the pilot program for kd network in

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,759
kerala

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,759
but before we go ahead uh

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,560
in knowing more about the kde network

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,880
chapters and the pilot project

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,640
uh we'll do that later in our discussion

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,080
in panel discussion round but we wanted

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,520
to give a bit of context

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,920
about how kitty network came to be

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,159
katie is always in search of bringing

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,119
new and fresh ideas by involving new

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,000
contributors

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,360
in our community and for that we have

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,799
google summer of code

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,200
our very own season of kitty we even

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,079
have

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,079
a welcome chat group in metrics so that

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,479
new members that join kitty

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,119
have a welcoming environment where they

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,240
can feel free to ask questions

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,479
in addition we have been improving our

00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,520
documentation

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,320
and have been making our websites more

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,560
appealing

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,560
and of course we host katie academy

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,879
every year which is the largest meetup

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,959
of kd developers all across the world

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:16,000
but we wanted to pivot our focus

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,239
on three main goals with kde network we

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,800
wanted to diversify our community

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,000
we wanted to increase our end users and

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,200
even wanted to create

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,520
brand awareness these three

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,120
are the tenants from which kd network

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
was originally developed across

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,120
diversifying our community we wanted to

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,200
make sure that

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,519
we reach underserved and

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,640
underrepresented communities that maybe

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,879
countries which stem fields careers is

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,519
still the minority of careers

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,680
we wanted to focus on increasing number

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,480
of women in our community by making sure

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,040
that

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,519
by making sure that they feel that they

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,319
have

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,080
a home with kde and they can begin to

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,120
contribute to the open source community

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,519
with us

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,680
and the way to achieve this we wanted to

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,239
create a grassroot level chapters

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,519
in small communities across the world

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,640
while one of the two

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,120
one or two kd members from a local team

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,000
form a local team and hosts meetups and

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,040
spread the word about kde to students

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,159
and developers a second goal

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,360
increasing end users we want to increase

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,319
our end users

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,799
and we feel that there is an untapped

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,879
market where kitty is not reaching

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,120
and for that we wanted to target

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,840
educational institutes

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,760
we have amazing products that we think

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,799
would benefit students across

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,000
each spectrum and for that we also we

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,319
should provide

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,760
translation and localization to reach

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,440
across

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,200
across to reach across the language

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,760
spectrum and for that

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,439
and most importantly we wanted different

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,879
countries to adopt kd

00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:00,159
very easily a last goal

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,200
would be creating brand awareness

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,560
we create some amazing amazing products

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,080
like krita kitty and live kitty plasma

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,200
environment

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,799
and many more and we think that we have

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,840
a lot of users

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,079
but not many people know about kitty

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,000
or maybe i can frame it in a different

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,000
way that not many people

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
know as much as they should know about

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,759
kde

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,280
i feel like there are a lot of people

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,000
who haven't given katie

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,120
a shot and if we increase our brand

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,160
awareness

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,479
then we might get a lot of end users

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
and we might make sure that kde becomes

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,880
a household name

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,240
and for that we believe that we can

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,280
achieve it by

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,280
increasing our social media presence

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,800
annika and paul have been working

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,000
rigorously for this

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,880
and we should always thank them for that

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,880
and so this is all about kde network and

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,280
its three goals

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,120
now we would like to move on over a

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,520
panel discussion round

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,919
where we're going to start talking about

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,639
what kde network has done in the past

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,639
and where we're going in the future and

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,680
i want to start by asking

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,800
eshwarya about her party chapter in

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,880
kerala

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,800
hi ashwarya hi so ashurya i would like

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,440
to know what was going through your mind

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,080
when

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,600
we accepted kerala as the pilot project

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,000
and how did you form

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,160
the team because you were in france how

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,520
how did you do that

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,400
yes so to start with before answering

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,600
the questions

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,479
for those who don't know

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,759
is a small state in the southern part of

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,759
india

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,840
with around 34 million people

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,639
and the official language of the state

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,520
is malaya so i will use malayalam in the

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,600
during the

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,199
discussion so it's the language of

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,720
kerala

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,000
so what uh what were my views

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,080
um i considered it as a very good

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
opportunity of course

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,720
because i think when an international

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
community

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,360
like kd give voice

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,199
or attention towards a smaller

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:22,400
community or a smaller population

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,880
that can add certain values

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,919
to the larger community and to the

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,680
smaller community

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:33,520
which is very important i think

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,479
and though it was an exciting thought

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,520
but then it was a series of questions so

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,720
how

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,680
we start how we can organize how

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
which kind of values we want to add in

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,319
which

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,440
area and how can we done that

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,880
those kinds of a series of questions but

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,080
it was nice to have kd network meetings

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,199
uh a bit frequently to gain more

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,680
confidence or

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,520
to change opinions or change views and

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,800
perspectives

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,160
and then another big question was

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,599
now i have to find more volunteer time

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,599
and that was a haunting thought

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,240
but in the end after processing all

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,000
these questions

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,840
uh i contacted subin he is the

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,400
coordinator of the kde malayalam

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,199
translation team

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,800
and of course i was sure that he would

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,680
he would be interested because

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,199
i have seen that he and his friends were

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,319
conducting translaton

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,720
for kde and they were promoting very

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,199
much

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,759
kde inside different free software

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,639
groups

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,199
so like i thought he was very interested

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,240
and we

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,360
decided to move forward

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,319
and so it was him who added more people

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,599
because he's

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,000
uh living in kerala so he has more

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,919
updates about what is going on in

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,400
different free software communities and

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,599
who would be interested in kde

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,440
so he added sri ram khan

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:12,479
and akhil this is the core group for now

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,319
and the kedi malayalam group

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,759
has the channel metrics channel or

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,800
telegram channel

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:23,520
has around 150 people

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:26,800
so yeah i think it was a good start

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,599
it was great okay so i i would also like

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,160
to know that

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,479
what was the first task you did for this

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,760
project

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,599
uh we started with localization of

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,240
uh translations of plasma workspace and

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,719
a bit of localizations and translations

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
like

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,519
because gcompre was i already started

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,519
the translation of g compre but

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,760
there was a lot of things to localize

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,760
like letters alphabets and

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,279
i had to add different levels for our

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,240
malayalam language

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,279
so that was the first task and we

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,480
decided to do

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,399
and it's still going on the task is

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,399
i mean there's a lot of things to

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,120
translate so it's going on

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,360
and we decided to focus on the

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,160
localization efforts

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,519
because we felt that we are not well

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,480
equipped

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,040
uh not for the university students

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,920
because

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,240
in kerala all the university students

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,279
are

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,959
okay with english language but for

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,920
common people for example last year

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:35,680
in academy talk maybe some of you may so

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,160
ambadi was presenting a talk about

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,920
a daily newspaper moving towards

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,120
complete free software workflow in

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,880
kerala

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,279
so and more uh newspapers are interested

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,399
to

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,120
go towards 100 free software workflow

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,800
with plasma they are using plasma uh

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,279
workspace and

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,560
and a lot of kelly steps and other

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,080
softwares too

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,760
but for these kinds of to for achieve

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
these kinds of achievements to to

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,680
achieve more sectors

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,720
we really need to localize and to

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,959
to give the common people not

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:18,240
not very people not very

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:21,600
easy with english to have easy access

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,399
and easy way to be in and to you

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,560
as a user too so that's why we choose to

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,760
start with translation

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,760
sorry that was a long answer

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,320
and uh we all know kerala is a place

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,959
where

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,640
open source is given a lot of importance

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,519
was it easier for you to start this

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,519
pilot project

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,640
um yes kerala is a very

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,959
fertile ground for free software

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,959
and the state government the kerala

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,160
state government has

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,680
had acknowledged the relevance of free

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,959
software

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,800
as early as 2001 and

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,120
in 2007 the government released an

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,240
information and communication technology

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,720
policy

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,959
in which one of the objective was highly

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,079
concentrated on free software

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,480
i would like to read out that part the

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,440
government realizes that free software

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,480
presents

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,959
a unique opportunity in building a truly

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,200
egalitarian knowledge society

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,720
the government will take all efforts to

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,279
develop free software

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
and free knowledge and shall encourage

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,120
and mandate

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,279
the appropriate use of free software in

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,519
all ict initiatives

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,399
so i don't need to talk a lot on that

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,519
topic so

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,959
it was indeed it's not really hard to

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,160
talk about free software

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:51,760
in general but

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,839
these achievements are gained

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,680
through a lot of struggles and and there

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,160
are a lot of free software activities

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,440
lots of

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,240
software communities and there were even

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
protests

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,560
by teachers community against teaching

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,120
proprietary software this kind of

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,880
thing happens and so the community is

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,079
very political

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,399
so it has its own um so it's

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,200
in a way it's very easy to start a free

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,079
software

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,040
uh initiative there but it has its own

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,639
challenges

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,959
too for now um

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,120
to start with we didn't had big issues

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,079
because we are a small group and we

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,800
all know that all are interested in kde

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,519
and

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,920
what the bigger community of kde how it

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,839
is

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:44,240
and all uh that was easy

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:47,760
but then the huddles came after

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,440
um i would say um recently during

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,320
academy what i

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,240
think is now the bigger community may be

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,720
thinking that it is

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,839
our efforts the kde network is the

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,079
reason

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,920
to include all these kd application in

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,880
the education system

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,639
but please don't uh forward this

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,279
narrative because it's

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,800
that could be ignoring a lot of years of

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,920
struggles and fights from other

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,120
activists

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,160
so if we put for a word that narrative

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,399
that will be hard for us the kd network

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,839
to grow there because of

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,040
political discussions and issues so

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,839
uh and that could be a

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,639
huddle but now i think as i presented it

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,279
it's okay

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,480
so everyone knows that it is not mainly

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,720
as it started

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
so all the initiatives are from long

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,320
time struggle

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,839
and of course we worked for betterment

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,920
in improvement and

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,120
for example it was they were using

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,920
decompre of

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,880
gnome washington all gtk washing so we

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,519
tried to

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,880
move to cute version so things like that

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,920
happened but

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,480
still the major grassroots things were

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,279
started before so we didn't have a lot

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,560
of

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:07,199
struggle in that part and another

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,959
um so the difficulty starts actually in

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,720
april for us

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:16,639
uh we have been a bit inactive since

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,839
april uh like you may all know that it's

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,160
really hard time for india like many

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,120
other countries in the world due to kobe

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,320
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,639
socially economically and all so this

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,680
has

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,279
affected a lot the team and our

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,720
activities too

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,760
and we were kind of depressed i would

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,120
say

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:43,040
and then but

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,399
no it's okay we are getting better we

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,839
will try to

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,000
reactivate soon and

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,360
though we were we were inactive in the

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
sense as a collective

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,240
but we were in all in our personal level

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,360
we were contributing or continuing

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,920
continuing our contributions yeah i

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,360
think

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,760
yeah that's it okay great

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,199
thank you thank you thank you so much

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,639
for real

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:14,160
now i would like to ask thomas about

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,440
the brazil network chapter so to me is

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,279
hi

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,399
um i wanted to know um what does brazil

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,440
think about

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,839
open source and was it easy for you

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,839
to start the brazilian network chapter

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:41,839
i'm so sorry to amaze we cannot hear you

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,040
i suppose tomas is trying to reconnect

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,000
again

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,000
so um

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,839
give it a minute

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,680
yeah we can hear you sorry apparently it

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,040
does not work on firefox on my machine

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,120
for some reason

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,079
so i don't think that it's ever easy on

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,160
any country because

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,440
even when the government is okay and

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,839
even when the

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,279
universities are okay and we try to

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,600
start the chapter

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,120
not a lot of people will try to go there

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,320
so we always have

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,199
just two little people to work on um

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,000
i am trying to get developers in brazil

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,880
for at least

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,440
16 years and currently the ke brazil

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,720
chapter

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,199
has 10 developers and i think that i

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,800
have

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,800
more than 3 000 students

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,720
that i've paid for my pocket should

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,000
travel to their series and then to teach

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,279
them

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,279
how to develop for open source doing

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:02,560
a really long like 40 hours to 80 hours

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,400
long course on all of the tooling bash

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,959
gits c plus plus q getting from the

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,640
start

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:15,199
ground basics to um

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,600
fully featured developer in 80 hours

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,880
we do have and i think that we are like

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,400
one of the

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,600
biggest countries in number of

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,400
developers we have 10 people

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,559
uh i think that it's improving right now

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,960
mostly because i'm opening for people

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,200
that are not only interested in kde

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,640
i say to them that i will help them do

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,280
whatever they want

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,400
if it is open source for free this is

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,960
helping

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,400
but when it was just i want to help you

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,400
only if you do open source

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,600
this feels like a little bit of a threat

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,840
and brazilian people are a little bit

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,280
combative so if you say that i will only

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,559
help you if you do this

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,120
they will not do anything they will try

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,039
to

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,039
combat with you they will try to show

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,840
you that they also have strength

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,679
and that will overcome nothing so right

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,559
now i'm helping people on you know i'm

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,760
helping people on

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,240
xfce it's easier for me if i help them

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,200
on kd because i already know how to work

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,679
within kd

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
and i don't need to waste my time

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,039
learning

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,919
so i can teach them but it's working

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,120
it's growing

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,480
um we got three people doing their

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,360
bachelor tests and their master

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,640
inside of kde technologies which is

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,840
really good

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,240
now the ah um i also got

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,240
two teachers trying to use kde software

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,799
within and i've also got one teacher

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,679
trying

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,880
to make sure yet one of applications

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,440
that he developed

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,600
inside of kde so this is doing great

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,919
we feel that a few of the universities

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,080
are coming to us for help instead of

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,440
us going to them begging for their

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,200
acceptance

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,720
and this is really good this is really

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,919
cool basically this is my thing

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,240
yeah it is it is so great and uh i

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
i've heard that you you were doing some

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,320
projects

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,720
for the brazilian network chapter like

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,799
if i'm not wrong something regarding the

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,360
panda project or something what what is

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,360
that about

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,760
repeats i did not get your last few

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,240
words okay yeah so i'm saying that

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,400
we've heard that you're doing a project

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,039
few projects for regarding for the kde

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,600
network

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,200
team the prezi network so it's it's

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,720
something it talked about the

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,240
panda or something i'm not sure of the

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,840
whole yeah

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,840
yeah yes the link here

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,600
so this software here that i'm pasting

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,559
on the chat

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,400
if i find the chats panel found it so

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,200
acquired branded this is a software

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,080
created by the university of sao paulo

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,919
one of the students that worked on the

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,679
software got in contact with us in the

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,640
kd brazil development channel on

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,960
telegram

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,760
and he said that we have the software it

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
works

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,120
it is goods we would like to see how

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,039
hard it would be to get on kde right now

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,799
and it's extremely hard it's extremely

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,280
hard because they have some stuff on

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,000
their ci that we can't provide yet

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,600
so we are working inside of kds so we

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
can provide their things

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,799
and we are also working with them so we

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,520
can make

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,559
the software up to standards to what kd

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,960
requires

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,080
so we are working on both sides the

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,440
software is really good

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,760
it is for teaching circuits and

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,200
circuit logic so boolean logic and how

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,240
to draw circuits

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,679
in a way that it's not a

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,679
professional structure but it's

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,960
specifically for teaching and a lot of

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,960
universities are missing that

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,120
i don't think that we will actually be

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,520
able to move the software to kde this

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,960
year because on kde we are using the ci

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,799
on git lab and i know that

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,960
ben is working quite hard on that not

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,520
just ben but then and all of this

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,440
is admins so this is one software the

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
other software that we are working on is

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,039
the

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,320
kd plasma firewall that was done with me

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:13,679
caillou thai lily berwick and also

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,240
lucas january from the university of

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,600
san carlos i forget the name sometimes

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,080
i'm too long without speaking portuguese

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,440
and he was doing his masters on top of

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,039
the firewall which is

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,200
quite cool because then he actually

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,320
managed to do two things at once that is

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,360
help open source

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,400
and help his university graduation

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,880
uh besides that we are also working on

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,559
console so because i am one of the main

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,159
developers of console and it's one of

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,520
the things that i'm touching the most

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,600
people ask me how can i

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,679
jump on kd code in a way that you can

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,120
actually help me a lot because i am a

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,039
newcomer i said man

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,400
i'm touching console every single day so

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,320
if you jump there

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,720
i will probably see your code really

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,799
fast so we had

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,039
three people joined their own console

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,960
and submitting a lot of calls and one of

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,280
the best thing that console got this

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,080
year

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,679
the tax reflow was made by one of those

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,760
students and he got

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,679
a job because of the work that he did in

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,640
the council which is also really cool

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,120
for me because

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,960
it shows that working on free software

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,559
will boost your resume and then

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,880
companies will realize that you are a

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,919
good developer and then

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,600
work yeah that's true so

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,200
that was great thank you thank you so

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,480
much thomas

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,640
and now i would like to ask anika

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,880
the founding member of katie network

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,919
hello anika

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,480
hi so i would like to know

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,480
how did this kitty network idea strike

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,960
you

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,200
okay so it's originally not my idea when

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,760
i started my career i was working for a

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
company

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,039
for a not not for profit organization so

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,679
i was handling the

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,440
middle east and the uk chapter but after

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,440
that we found a lot of people who wanted

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,120
to support from other countries and we

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,039
started developing over there

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,320
so this idea clicked to me that if they

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,840
can do it and

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,520
i'm from pakistan it was happening in

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,360
pakistan and we had chapters all over

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,919
the world in the us uk

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,880
canada so i said why not let's apply

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,240
this idea to kde because kde has people

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,480
all over the world of course

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,919
we have mostly in europe and we want to

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,480
improve the diversity

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,360
so let's try it so that's how the idea

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,000
came up and

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,799
we thought india as the pilot study

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,799
because on

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,960
linkedin we have most of the viewers

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,640
from india so that's how we decided for

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,159
india

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,240
oh okay so um we know that our next

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,880
chapter is going to be in china

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,279
how did you contact them and how did you

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,200
form this team

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:49,200
okay so it's uh the han it happened was

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,520
connected me to two people from to

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,520
actually run uh her name is mina

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,760
and then she connected us to budget so

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,880
mina and rajis are basically handling

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,520
china network and now they have started

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,279
uh having events but not now but soon we

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,000
are going to have an event over there

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,559
where we would like people from kde to

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,919
have

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,840
talks and we will be also participating

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,240
in other events in china so that we can

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,480
attract more students and users

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,000
so that's how actually china started but

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,279
now of course we are having a little bit

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,919
of language barrier but

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,360
hopefully soon we'll be able to overcome

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,559
that as well

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,120
okay and uh once this china network

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,840
starts

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,240
properly any thoughts about our next

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,320
chapter

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,640
okay i think uh we need help from the

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,480
community because that's how everything

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
has started because people start coming

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,039
up

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,039
that okay there's a potential in this

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,640
market if they think that okay they can

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,679
actually help us and support us because

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,679
we need people

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,039
who are committed towards this course we

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,880
don't want people who just come

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,480
today and say after a month and we can't

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,559
do it so if anybody

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,640
may be from bangladesh or malaysia

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,440
africa anywhere if you think that you

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,240
can start a chapter in your country or

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,559
city

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,240
please please connect to us and we will

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,919
surely help you and we'll guide you how

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,320
you can start with that great

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,080
i i still vividly remember nikah when we

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,640
were planning about this kde network

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,279
you you were you were focusing so much

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,000
on the

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,520
diversifying our community and you had

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,480
such amazing ideas

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,679
so what made you say think that okay

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,440
this thing will work in kde

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,840
okay so one of our goal is to increase

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,840
diversity and if you see that we have

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,400
majority if you would even

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,400
uh see mostly we have i would say

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,200
european males and that was something in

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,200
my mind that i

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,480
have to somehow bring more women and

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,279
people from different cultures and

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,960
community

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,000
to represent now you can see on the

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,000
screen there are three people

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,919
that was my goal that okay i have to

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,640
bring in more women

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,480
and i feel that you know in especially

00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,440
we three can relate that india and

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,200
pakistan

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,880
we feel that it is one of the field

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,679
engineering is one of the fields that

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,320
we see mostly men and boys starting out

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,799
there right

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,640
and females are usually not encouraged

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,720
to uh like such kind of fields

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,120
so i felt that if you know they see that

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,320
okay for example if perseveria has come

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,000
and joined us maybe

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,159
she's starting this in kerala a lot of

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,559
women will be inspired by it

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,480
that's true yes so

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,000
that is an amazing thank you so much for

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,600
bringing the skating network

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,360
thank you for actually helping me

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,559
otherwise this idea wouldn't have been

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,120
successful

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,880
no thank you thank you so much anika and

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,440
thank you everyone

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,320
um please feel free to ask any questions

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,320
if anyone has

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:52,240
hello um your question

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:56,240
um person for today

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,320
hi so we have two questions in fact

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,559
um the first one from paul do you know

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,559
how kerala governments became interested

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,440
and look and educated in free software

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,760
matters

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,400
where they're activists that inform them

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,360
of the advantages

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,760
yeah so there was different perspective

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,640
uh

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,159
when the government started to just

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,279
start to decide

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,640
sorry decided to

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,279
use computers in public staffs and

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,000
in schools there was a public call and

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,559
the response was from microsoft oracle

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,120
and a free software community group it

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,559
was

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,760
linux users group trivandrum uh a linux

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,240
user group

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,799
so there was debate and it was free

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,799
software who won the debate so

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,919
naturally uh free software won the

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,840
debates because

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,399
and the first thing is you don't need um

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,279
so

00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,880
to have microsoft government should

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,799
spend a lot of money

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,960
and the second thing is about uh um

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,200
windows was not localized there was no

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,480
malayalam in the

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,399
stop so uh but linux distributions were

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,720
localized fast enough

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,840
from the beginning so it was a very good

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,720
point to

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,840
gain the one the debate and then the

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,120
activists were

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,760
working toward with some

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,760
teachers communities teachers political

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,200
parties and communities

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,559
so i think teachers could connect that

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,120
faster and that's how there was

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,399
a lot of protests and that's how all

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,600
started i guess

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:38,480
i'm not sure i was i think from my

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,480
readings yes

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,480
very very very interesting especially to

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,559
have the user groups the local

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,480
free software user group is so involved

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,080
so that's really nice to hear

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,279
and also from personal point of view

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,240
it's interesting to hear the

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,399
localization

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,480
point being so important so i'm happy

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,600
for that

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,159
okay um another question from

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,840
david can kerala be a model for growth

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,320
in the rest of india or do other states

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,279
demand

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,200
unique strategies uh it's already in

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,480
other states they are using

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,200
for example tamil nadu it's has already

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,120
migrated to free software i think at

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,120
least i saw in the

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:24,240
uh the teachers training uh they were

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,600
teaching how to use reconcili to

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:31,120
teach staffs and how to use k stars or

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,240
they were using a knife so obviously

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,120
tamil nadu and i guess kannadaga

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,799
and all the there are other states too

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,120
moving towards it

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,880
i'm not sure it's because of kerala but

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,960
there are a lot of

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,080
free software communities here and there

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,120
uh in india

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,600
like who come with me no more but

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,840
yes so they are all moving towards and

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,840
some are already migrated

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,760
thanks another question from alesh

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:08,720
how are we fixing the language problem

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:11,360
to approach the chinese community

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,520
so uh what i am doing right now is that

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,840
uh i'm in contact with mina and burgess

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,840
and we have actually made we tried the

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,320
same thing for malayalam as well

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,000
but because in india uh everybody

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,960
understands english but in china that's

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,240
not the case

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,520
so what we are doing is that we are

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,720
going to translate each and every

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,520
document which we have

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,039
in chinese so it is much easier for them

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,840
to understand about kde

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,520
so all our presentations our basic stuff

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,039
which we have about kde

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,039
is going to be translated we will have a

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,799
separate page right now we have it in

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,520
english but we are going to have it in

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,520
chinese as well

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,919
there is also another question which

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,600
could be if there are no other questions

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,960
in the meantime a good conclusion in

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,880
this how do i

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,520
how do i help in making regional

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,520
communities

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,279
okay so we have channels um kde network

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,200
you just have to join there

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,559
and suggest which city and country you

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,320
think has potential

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,840
and then we can discuss it and we can

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,679
take it further so it's just

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,360
you if you know that there is potential

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,320
there are a lot of people interested in

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,840
free software

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,840
and then we can take it forward together

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,200
thank you thank you so much uh i don't

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,320

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,159
any other question uh

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,000
right now we technically have a few

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,120
other minutes before the last talk i'm

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,039
