Title: Akademy 2021 - Communitys Adventures in Analyticsland
Publication date: 2021-06-28
Playlist: Akademy 2021
Description: 
	By Christelle Zouein & Kevin Ottens
Things got a bit quiet and slow again regarding the community data analytics. The universe has a weird sense of humor, admittedly it went out of control this time. But behind the scene, things have still been happening in the community at large and with our community data analytics tooling in particular. This talk will explain what's new in that department and produce a new report on the community adventures. No line will be stolen from Lewis Carroll for this talk... until we decide otherwise.
In this talk we will pick up where we left in 2018. We focused quite a bit on the history of the tools we use for community data analytics. Because of this we showed only a few phenomena which could but didn't do a large study of the community.
Since then, more features have been added to our tooling which allow to leverage more data for GitLab based projects. Since KDE now switched to GitLab for a little while, it is time to take a closer look at the interactions happening there. This is especially interesting since even quite a bit of traffic from mailing lists moved on that platform.
We will revisit several older topics under that new light. In particular, we should have a much more precise reading of the contributor networks than ever before. Also, we will see how KDE did under the on-going pandemic.

[Music]

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,280
thank you

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,520
so welcome everyone for this talk though

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,600
that's a bit of an update on the

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,680
community analytics we've been working

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,359
on in the past few years

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,640
uh but yeah first i will let

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,119
kristen introduce ourselves so my name

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,079
is kisar i'm a computer engineering

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,680
student and i'm majoring in data science

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,239
i'm currently doing a data science

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,280
internship at inyuka consulting and this

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,840
is my second internship at inukah

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,719
my first one was in 2019 and i was

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,200
working on cam

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,399
then with kevin and that's how i got to

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,719
know kde

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,719
and camden as well that's pretty much

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,000
so as for me uh so i'm one of the

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,719
old-timers

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
uh in kde uh that's what they say

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,000
apparently

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,119
uh and so i started using it in the

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,840
nineties and only started

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,000
to contribute a few years later then i

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,000
fell in love with the community

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,920
and i've been helping around with kd

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,640
leaves and then kd frameworks and also

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,840
community stuff which includes the setup

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,560
helping the setup of the ekd manifesto

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,520
and so this effort about community data

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,439
analytics

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,200
which we are going to talk about today

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,600
uh and as christian mentioned

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,799
uh i'm part of the enu called culture

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,360
family

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,799
where we are doing services around

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,600
software

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,759
and i live in toulouse still i'm not

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,240
going to move from there

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,560
all right so let's start with with that

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,000
particular talk

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,399
and so um

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,040
what happened previously right so you're

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,840
used to that

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,240
always a bit of history with me um and

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,479
so that starts with that guy and his

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,280
ridiculous dog

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,879
and he's been taking over an idea from

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,920
adorian de gut

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,000
which was named the green blobs

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
back then and he brought something named

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,440
gidviz

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,879
and made the blobs blue so he did a few

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,440
interesting talks for us his dear paul

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,480
adams

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,120
uh you know community he kind of retired

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,360
in 2017

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,160
and now he prefers to have fun with his

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,160
dog apparently

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,480
so that's when i came in the picture

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,400
uh i basically thought gidviz uh

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,160
why i asked him first if he was fine

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,200
with that and so on and basically he

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,319
gave me the code and i uh expanded it

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,560
quite a bit

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,440
uh so i reused mostly the git passing

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
code

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,560
but then most of the dependencies i

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,879
swapped with something else so

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,840
i change for pandas for the data

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,040
processing

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,480
uh network x for the graph analysis and

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,519
bokeh for the actual output

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,280
which gives us as we see in this talk

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,120
better uh better of this registration um

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
i also added some ways to clean up the

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
data with rules

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,840
which is i mean important right uh for

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,519
identifying people for instance when

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
people are not necessarily consistent in

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,720
the way they commit the name they used

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,799
uh then a bunch more visualizations and

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,319
the big advantage of bokeh is that we

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,239
have more interactivity in the

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,000
visualizations so unfortunately that's a

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,280
pdf so we won't be able to see that

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,200
today

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,440
but otherwise i mean you're able to zoom

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,599
in and out and plan and everything

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,760
which makes it much easier to actually

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,239
explore the results

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,879
so a few examples of what we do so you

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,000
might have seen

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,480
that on my uh on my blog for instance so

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,239
that one is one of the simplest one to

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,840
understand right that's basically a week

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,879
per week

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,480
the common commit count and the number

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,959
of unique committers

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,599
uh which gives you an approximation of

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,200
the

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,920
um team size uh each week right

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,680
in the community and so you can see that

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,079
evolve over time and then get a trend

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,799
then we got the activity plot which is

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,840
the one

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,639
uh truly generated from poll

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,320
and now it's basically colorful because

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,759
we have more thresholds for the

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,320
for the activity so each line is a

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,199
contributor and then it's each column is

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,120
a week

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,320
and then you get a color depending on

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,320
how active you've been

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,280
and the last thing that all the

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
contributors are sorted by the first

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,560
commit date

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,400
uh which is interesting because this way

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,520
you see people coming in the picture

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,280
right so you get that

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,000
envelope there which gives you an idea

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,440
of how much you're recruiting

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,880
and then uh so that the envelope i've

00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,759
been talking about so you forgot about

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,960
that red dot

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,800
and then inside of this area the denser

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
it is the more attention you get right

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,639
because that means the more people who

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,919
came in

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,240
actually contribute for a long while uh

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,919
otherwise you get like here like one

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,580
shot and then the person disappear

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,960
right um

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,160
[Music]

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,479
and then we also have the contributor

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,080
network so for that one we basically

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,000
plot a network

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,120
to get an idea of who collaborates with

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,080
whom

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,600
and that's based on uh when we're

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,199
looking at the commits that's based on

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,759
the assumption that if they touch the

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,440
same file there's

00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,880
a chance of some communication happening

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,800
at some point

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,080
so that they don't step on each other

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
toes

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,880
and so we basically draw a line between

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,880
those two persons

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,400
and that one is the oddest one to read

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,400
so that the centrality

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,120
for a particular person because as soon

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,199
as you can do plots like this

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,919
you can tell if a person is very

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,600
centrally in the graph or not right so

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,759
we color coded the notes so that one is

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,639
fairly central for instance

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,840
uh but that's a picture at a given point

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,080
in time now if you

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
rinse and repeat that for i don't know

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,680
every week or every month

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,360
you can see for a particular person that

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,800
value evolved and that's what we are

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,080
plotting there

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,919
so the blue line here

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,360
that's basically the centrality of that

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,199
particular person which happens to be

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,000
vulgar krause

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,560
who is in the other room right now so

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,319
that the

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
centrality of that particular person

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,680
over time

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,560
and so you can see that it can be fairly

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,319
central and then a bit less right

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,080
and related to this we show also the

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,759
activity so that is the number of

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,240
commits everything is normalized though

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,319
so that's why it goes all the way to

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,919
one and zero um and one thing we

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,360
realized that if the

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,039
team is small and you have a lot of

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,000
activity then you get fairly central

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,840
quickly right so

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,160
we also show the team size because

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,520
that you can draw conclusion of that

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,800
blue curve

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,199
only at periods of times where the team

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,120
size is somewhat constant so around here

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,840
we can draw a conclusion but it

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,199
in there right it's kind of shrinking so

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,000
we cannot draw any

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,039
real conclusion about that by creator or

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,240
that one

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,520
but there we can start to do some

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,759
conclusions

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,680
so uh that's a quick recap of things

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,479
i've been talking about in the past

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,240
um and then there's kind of an open

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,360
question that's just a fun puzzle kevin

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,680
right where you do this

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,120
uh well it's definitely a fun puzzle i

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,720
reply

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,000
but not only right because that

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,360
that's a way for us to show also

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,360
if a community is healthy um

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,479
because of the activity level right as i

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,479
mentioned we see if we

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,080
recruit people if we if people stays

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,160
around or not right

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,400
if we have a large or small bus factor

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,479
for particular teams

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,199
we can also see the team structure we

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,879
can also see teams splitting

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,680
which i didn't quite explain here but i

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,440
brought a blog about that

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,919
and there are also actually professional

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,680
uses i've been using that for instance

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,080
for

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,039
framing technical projects at customers

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,960
when they wonder

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,319
yeah what should i pick as a dependency

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,919
right

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,759
some of the reasons for picking

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,640
something are technical some of them are

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,680
more because of the community

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,519
and also interestingly you can edit the

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,599
actual customer code with this kind of

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:44,240
tools and you find some funny

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:47,440
facts sometimes um

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,920
so that's yeah what i said pretty much

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,680
um right so especially for the code

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,959
editing it makes it easier to explore

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,240
the project history

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,600
uh also today to evaluate the developers

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,640
turnover right

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,560
inside of a team at a customer uh and

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,080
that also helps you find out how the

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,080
team is structured right and

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,000
who owns which part of the code for

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,120
instance and who works with

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,480
womb this kind of answers you can

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,640
get and that can be fairly important for

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,360
customers

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
and you can identify the key people on a

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,640
particular project

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,519
i mean if you start looking at those

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,120
graphs after a few hours or a few days

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,519
you basically know everyone on the

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,519
project

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
all right and with that so we're going

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,200
to expand the view

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,839
and i'm going to let crystal continue

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
with this

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,080
um okay so what's

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,360
new um what's new is that we've added

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,920
um data sources so it's not only about

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,800
the code commits anymore

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,959
uh we found we find that the code

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,560
commits are are not capturing

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,560
like everything about projects so we

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,839
thought about adding new new sources

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,720
like like merge requests issues

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,200
and uh mailing lists and that's where

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,480
that's

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,040
pretty much what i did during my

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,040
internship

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,880
so uh and then was a bunch of

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,959
python scripts it was a couple of

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,160
scripts for like centrality and activity

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,279
and all of that and

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,200
well my work on it was essentially to

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,000
make it more user-friendly and easier to

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,959
use so

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,920
we turned it into a pipe api which makes

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,959
it easier

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,279
to to handle and to to to reproduce

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,240
results and all of that so so it works

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,120
like this

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,000
you have come down which is the library

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,160
and

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,360
and you can you can use it to do all

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,200
sorts of things you can parse

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
repositories and then you get a pandas

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
data frame

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,079
that you can use with certain files and

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,880
with pretty much

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,240
options so so you don't have to just use

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,920
it with activity you can use it with

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,480
network and then parse it once and then

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,480
you can display it with like uh with a

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,000
different

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,320
with different characteristics and all

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,320
of that

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,839
so what are the new data sources we have

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,160
mailing lists

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,200
so mailing lists are pretty pretty

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,200
common way to to

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,480
discuss things and bugs and reports and

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,279
all of that in teams and was it was

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,600
pretty widely used in developer

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,959
communities

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,440
a couple of years ago now it's it's more

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,399
now there are different ways to to

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
discuss things

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,720
but it was it was pretty common so we

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,959
thought about adding that

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,640
it's pretty much it's not very common

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,360
anymore so we might not use it in

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,880
practice

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,519
but but it's pretty interesting to look

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,680
at the history uh we also have github

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,200
gitlab discussions which are issues and

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
merge requests and we thought that be

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,480
interesting

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,279
because this is where the discussion

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,120
around code happens and this is this

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,320
this allows us to look at things that we

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,639
didn't look at before

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,519
at how peop how central people are to

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,200
like

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,360
to contributing differently and not just

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,920
code and this leads to

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,959
a new metric which is the responsiveness

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,240
like how much

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,360
how responsive a team is

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,160
so eventually we potentially this will

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,720
allow for

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,680
aggregate aggregated views so

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,880
for example we can we can combine

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,440
commits graphs

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,880
and merge requests graphs to have a

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,279
fuller idea

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,800
and things like that to have to have a

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,399
better view of the community a better

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:42,000
idea a better image

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,959
oh i also forgot to say i'm sorry

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,560
that it's not it's not it's not easy to

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,680
map

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,720
commit authors to gitlab users so so

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,959
that's something we're pretty

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,279
we're still we hope to work on but

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,880
we eventually want to to to get to a

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,480
point where we can combine all sorts of

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,480
views for different data sources

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,920
so what about our data set here where

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,639
we're talking we're going to talk about

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,240
like

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,160
what's happening with the community so

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,040
we have a data set that we're going to

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,399
analyze and

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,519
what is it so it's it's constituted of

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,480
of all the kde repositories

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,240
so yeah all 950 plus of them and even

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,800
the ones are unmaintained because we

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,120
think

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,040
they offer pretty interesting insight

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,279
and well we're using the

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,959
we're using the the feature income done

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,120
that allows us to

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,079
to program some rules and then apply

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
them to

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,000
to our data while processing them so

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,399
that's the rule set

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,600
and this allows us to handle big

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,639
offenders

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,079
that have um names that commit from

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,760
different names like

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:55,920
motel for example commits from hotel and

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,160
and we we with rule sets we can we can

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,760
we can uh we can we can make sure that

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,360
this is going to be the same person

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,440
that's committing and this this helps us

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,440
reduce biases and our statistics

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,440
so when it comes to kde as a whole

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,560
uh well this is an update this is the

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,120
activity

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,839
the all-time activity of commits commits

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,800
only

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,800
so a couple of points are pretty much

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,920
stand out like there's

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,959
been active ever since 1999. he's

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,800
right here so we zoomed in previously

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,160
and we saw his name right here

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,600
and he's been pretty active uh

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,360
ever since 1999 he's got orange colors

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,600
right here so that's that's

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,839
more active than than the average and

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,560
then we have inflection points like

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,199
one right here and one right here and

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,519
these inflection points point out to

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,440
faster recruiting after 2010 right here

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,560
and faster recruiting in the last couple

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,680
of years

00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,880
but we we have less retention

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,760
like yellow here is less dense so people

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,000
are

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,800
are not staying they're not always

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,120
contributing

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,880
but it's getting better and here it's

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,839
more dense so the people that joined in

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,839
the last couple of years are still here

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,320
and as from 2017

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,320
uh well this is the zoomed in graph this

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,639
starts from 2017

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,519
and we thought there are some people

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
that have been

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,560
active contributors and like we'd like

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,959
to mention them

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,000
i'm sorry if i'm going to butcher their

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,720
names i

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,759
i don't intend to but here we go there's

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
agata

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,759
there's ahmad samir there's alexander

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,040
leno there is

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:47,360
alexander stipek or stippage

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,639
camilo higuita carl shawn david redondo

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:55,839
devin lynn han young jan blackwell

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,839
jonah brooker mevenkar

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,079
and well you guys are pretty like pretty

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,079
active contributors and thank you for

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,120
your work

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,040
so what about merge requests

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,880
this is the activity for merge requests

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,720
and obviously

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,600
obviously more recent we have less

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,800
history here we start at around

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,040
2018 so the

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,920
kde moves on to get that pretty recently

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
and we don't have

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,959
git lab merge requests from before that

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,880
so that's

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,399
it's pretty obvious but there are some

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,519
things we can we can

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,720
we can learn like uh here there's an

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,680
inflection point so

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,800
so people have been more active on merge

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,199
requests

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,480
we see people appear like xavier huggle

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,839
and michael johnson

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,240
they're pretty active on merge requests

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,680
so uh why didn't we there there's an

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,480
interesting question here

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,639
we didn't spot them on commit activity

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,040
but we're spotting them here so

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,000
so that could be related to the fact

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,399
that

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,079
they're more they're more active uh

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,679
discussing code but not necessarily

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,120
contributing it and that's for example

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,959
another

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,640
another position in the open source

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,640
community where you don't

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,839
necessarily contribute a lot of code but

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,839
like guide

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,679
the development of features and things

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,039
like that

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,799
and when it comes to the team side

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:29,039
excuse me um here we have the

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:32,000
the the entry count in blue and then you

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,039
have the team size in orange

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,120
and this is the peak that was uh the

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,799
nokia peak that's in 2010

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,840
so i i i think this is when nokia bought

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,480
cute so that's that and then we have a

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,720
bit of

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,720
civilization right here and then it

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,400
picks up again so in 2019

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,640
2020 we have the entry count that

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,760
clearly picks up then we have a trend

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,080
that's pretty

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,840
positive for for the number of

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,520
developers that are active the number of

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,160
contributors

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
and well for marriage requests we

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,039
clearly have

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,160
um we clearly have a

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,760
like a growing trend

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,440
but the thing is we don't have enough

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,440
data to to have

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,760
a more precise or intelligent insight so

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
so

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,080
what we really get from this graph is

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,760
that we need more data

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,039
and well as as for the new metric for

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,000
merge requests this

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,360
is the responsiveness where in orange we

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,799
have the response time

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:40,000
in hours so here is a lot of hours for

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,679
uh for response time and converge

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,600
not much uh so

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,440
responsible are becoming more reactive

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,960
to merge requests

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,200
which is a pretty good sign uh

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,120
it took some time but but we're there

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,000
and then you have we have the blue shape

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,679
right here this is

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,720
bars that that pretty much

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,160
that represented the star of

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,640
unanswered merge requests so we can see

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,080
that it's

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,000
growing and that could be due to the

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:15,200
fact that it's so recent in 2021

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,120
uh but that's that this is the the stock

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,840
of unanswered merge requests

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,559
now it's important to know that the

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,559
history of

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,880
the history for uh merge requests goes

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,559
a bit before the instance existed which

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,200
is counter-intuitive because before the

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,000
instance

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,679
existed how can we have things like that

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,480
well this is because

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,720
kaiden got important with all of its

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,559
history and well it's been excluded

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,559
to to produce this plot

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,480
okay and this is the network

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,799
for commits so uh

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,799
this shows the centrality of users as

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,919
kevin previously explained so we have

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,640
some users that

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,320
that are very central so the top could

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,600
be

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,679
alexander leno nicholas fella carl

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,720
shawn and heiko becker and they're

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,000
pretty central their

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,760
their node is like in black or very dark

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,039
purple

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,640
and well uh for merge requests

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,559
we also see there are people that are

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,360
very central and you see the same people

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,919
that come back

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,960
like nicholas fella we also see graham

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,720
alexander leno

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,320
ahmed samir and the alex paul

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,919
something that's interesting is that

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,000
lauren is nowhere to be seen

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,120
we see him we see that he's very very

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,440
central

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,360
for the net for the commits network but

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,919
he's he's not very central when it comes

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,880
to get

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,640
get lab merge requests uh which pretty

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,000
much shows a couple of things

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,760
uh first is that he he's

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,600
he's contributing code but he's not

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,039
necessarily discussing features that

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,320
he's contributing with a lot of people

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,440
so he could be

00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,559
uh developing things in his corner

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,720
and well the the for example uh

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,559
changing changing this for coding or

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,640
changing certain loops writing them

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,960
another way

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,080
uh but the other thing that we can see

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,120
is that

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,679
uh commits on their own aren't enough to

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,080
really

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,640
tell if someone is central to the

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,640
community

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,440
but then let's zoom out a bit uh

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,440
this is the the

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,640
the sub network for krita this is where

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,120
kerala enters the scene

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,720
and we have right here a person that's

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,760
very central and this person

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,679
is hala ramped

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,520
the who answers a lot of merge requests

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,080
and and pretty much is very active

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,480
within

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,480
krita

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,280
and on to kevin

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,760
all right so let's continue with this

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,280
um so obviously what we've been seeing

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,240
with christelle

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,640
that the community has a wall right but

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,720
then sometimes you also need to

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,559
look at subparts right to make sure that

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,159
you're not mistaking

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,720
you know the forest for the tree um and

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,679
so

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,960
we looked at two uh other examples you

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,200
try to see if there were other

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,360
phenomenons we could spot in there

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,600
uh so one of them is kd5 marks so

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,120
basically we did everything then focus

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,480
on frameworks and then we'd have a focus

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,320
on krita because we've seen that

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,240
interesting fact with the sub network

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,320
there um

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,320
so for the all-time activity so i'm

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,000
sorry because this one will be colors

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,280
unfortunately it's slightly harder to

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
read than the previous one because

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,320
there's

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,960
a bit less density in yellow right uh

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,960
but if you look closely you see that the

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,679
profile

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,440
is very similar to the world kde right

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,799
there are two reflection different

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,640
inflection points though which don't

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,320
match the ones we've seen for the world

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,360
community because there's one which is

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,640
before

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,600
um 2010 uh and which is

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,559
likely the kd3 kd4 transition where a

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,720
lot of people

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,240
it's actually fairly sharp right well a

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,280
lot of people actually jumped in

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,480
to help with that transition in kdeebs

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,799
and we also see another one around 2014

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,159
that's actually the year that we

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,600
released the first

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:27,440
kd frameworks five uh

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,919
for the activity uh um

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,159
we could yeah for the activity we can

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,280
also zoom in like we did and so i did

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,720
a zoom there where we are basically

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,760
focusing on the

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,279
main recruits around that period uh

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,159
which i actually managed to get on the

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,080
same graph but

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,360
one of the top one at the bottom uh no

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,240
meaning to that

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,240
but that's pretty much so amazing

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:56,799
getting very active and alexander

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,799
luno as well so from 2018 and 2020.

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,840
um right and then we have the all-time

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,039
activity but

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,880
for the match requests and we see

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,039
toward the top you might see that

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,520
there's gives that feeling of a

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,159
thicker line but that's not a thicker

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,919
line

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,760
it's actually two lines which are very

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,840
active around the same time

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,960
and if you look at who that is that's

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,400
pretty much david

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,679
for and hamad samir right so you can see

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,200
that they're talking

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,600
to each other quite a lot right because

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,240
they seem to send messages around the

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,240
same time

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,200
then for the all-time theme size uh we

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,919
see

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,120
very clear ramp up uh for frameworks

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,159
five right both in

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,200
activity and team size um

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,960
and we also see an exhaustion phase

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,240
right around here and that's pretty much

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,320
why we

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,840
work toward kd fireworks five then it's

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,240
released and then there's a dip in

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,760
activity right everyone tries to recover

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,000
and then it ramps again

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,520
and clearly it's been picking up quite

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,799
uh some some pace

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,960
uh since a couple of years um

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,120
open questions there but it could be

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,880
actually the development model of kd

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,320
frameworks five right before that was kd

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,960
leaves then we changed the development

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,080
model

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,720
kind of uh paying off that ramp up that

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,080
could also

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,880
be the preparations for

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,919
kf6 which are ongoing right now so again

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,000
that

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,320
increase and that could be actually both

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,840
right so then you get a component

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,679
effect uh

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,600
right for that we cannot say much right

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,960
clearly for this kind of stuff we need

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,039
more data at that point

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,000
uh for the responsiveness similar

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,880
profile

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,320
than the world community we see it's

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,080
very slow at the beginning and then it

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,640
picks up

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,640
it kind of converges back but there's

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,520
slower responsiveness though

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,120
on average it's three days to a week on

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,600
average and

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,960
uh on average on the community it's yeah

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,960
more around two or three days

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,880
for the network so we get the east

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,840
frontality top five again

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,840
for the commit so hamilton

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,480
right you're only surprised there uh

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,240
well because you see david four

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,520
more in the top five for the merge

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,760
requests right

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,679
uh we have the same effect around laura

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,679
montel again that's because rohan

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,960
commits in plenty of flies so with the

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,720
assumption of

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,640
touching the same file you collaborate

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,120
right then he shows up in the previous

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,480
one

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,720
but he's not very active on the merge

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,480
request actually discussing stuff

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,640
he's doing i mean a lot of cleanups

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,240
which are very important but then

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,000
it's not really part of the decision

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,720
making uh which happens in the merch

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,559
request

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,640
so it doesn't show up but then we see

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,480
david for showing up again so he's all

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,480
very much managerial now right

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,520
all right and how quickly because we

00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,159
don't have that much time left

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,400
zoom on krita itself right so there will

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,080
be community right subpart and now just

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,120
a team for particular software um

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,640
so that's interesting again if you look

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,640
at that one so the profile

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,880
kind of similar a bit but it seems to

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,919
recruit faster on average

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,200
than uh the world of kde right so it

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,120
records faster

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,720
that being said right if it's hard to

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,440
read that because here we don't have

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,240
that much density so it seems to have

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,799
a faster recruiting on average to the

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,520
world of kde but at the same time

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,520
the price of that maybe is to have a

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,919
lower retention right so

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,399
it has a lower retention on average than

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,200
the rest of kd

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,559
uh if we go for the focus on the

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,279
recruits from the past

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,159
couple of years that's mostly ion

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:56,000
o'neill

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,000
agata kakou shahraf man and they flew

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,559
for the merge requests

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,360
clearly dimitrijk dimitri kazakhov and

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,000
ala ramp

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,480
they're like top of the game right uh so

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,679
they're

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,480
clearly the decision maker uh among

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,480
among that team

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,000
uh again we see the nokia peak because

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,799
that was very much a big thing for

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,720
krita back then when it was part of

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,000
caligra

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,559
and since then though so they are the

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,880
peak their stabilization phase

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,640
but clearly it's growing uh and it

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,159
started to grow

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,360
a bit earlier uh than

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,720
kd as a world after the nokia peak um

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,520
but then that team growth is is a bit

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,960
slower

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,080
there there's more uh increase on the

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,120
on the count of commits all right

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,880
yeah more data please right so we'll do

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,320
that again in a couple of more years and

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,720
that might be more interesting

00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,840
uh very interesting with krita though is

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,600
the all-time

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,399
responsiveness on the merge request so

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,320
it's similar to the kd community

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,480
for the responsiveness we see it's slow

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,480
in the beginning and then it converges

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,480
which is normal right adaptation to a

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,200
new tool being introduced

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,840
um one thing they do super well though

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,080
is

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,039
they're very tidy on the unanswered

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,399
stock right

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,720
because they have virtually no stock

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,200
what's reducer there that just

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,559
the last weeks right of the story so

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,520
that's normal that you have stuff which

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,799
is unanswered

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,799
uh of their recent

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,480
one thing we spotted though which is

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,679
surprising to us and we have no good

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,799
explanations for this

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,600
is that one we see that it starts to

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,039
converge

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,399
right but then this yeah peak

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:49,360
uh in 2020 it's unclear to us

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,399
why uh and if someone has an insight

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,080
about that

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,240
it's very welcome i would like to know

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,840
actually why they could

00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,240
have been this uh phenomenon

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,240
for the network so centrality top five

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,039
dean trick is a curve i've been wrong at

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,200
a rant shop that man and erin o'neill

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:11,600
names that we heard before uh on the

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,880
uh match request though uh we see

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,799
volterra appearing

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,240
uh with not only on the commit

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,320
so apparently a bit more in the

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,600
conversations and a bit less in the

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,600
volume of commits a test

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,600
all right so we're almost uh at the end

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,840
i'm

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,399
i have to go a bit quickly on that part

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,159
to give some time for

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:39,279
this and then the conclusion

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,120
so there's a name i mean

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,120
there's a name that we heard quite a bit

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,480
except in the part of on krita

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,840
uh in the community so with

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,799
uh hamad samir right who's been fairly

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,720
active uh we see him

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,480
i mean he registers at the world

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,520
community level registers on kd

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,399
frameworks

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,559
um and so we thought that could be a

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,559
good case even though the plot is not

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,480
super interesting in a way but that was

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,600
a good case you um

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,000
try with the um

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
with the centrality uh metric which i

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,240
was talking about earlier

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,480
so as a reminder you should basically

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,399
try so that

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,720
you should basically trust only when

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,440
this plateaus okay so the data before

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,679
that

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,000
because the team size is still growing

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,559
you cannot really draw any conclusion

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,840
on that part uh that plot has been

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,720
produced

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,760
with the kd frameworks merge request

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,120
data set

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,760
and only that part and

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,600
then we can see with the orange line

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,720
which is the centrality level we can see

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,039
that basically

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,640
ahmad is like just shooting right

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,200
through uh that ramp up

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,880
of the team and whatever happens with

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,880
the team and the activity is just

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,960
growing and growing in the centrality

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,399
uh so i think that's actually a name we

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,880
should count on

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,159
we should come with if he keeps at it

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,240
like that

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,120
is hell bent on being very very central

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,679
to kd frameworks in particular

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,679
all right and with that i leave you with

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,679
crystal again for the conclusion

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,559
so when it comes to the metrics we've

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,480
noticed that it's

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,000
um we actually think that it's

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,320
interesting to have

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,600
the conversation during code reviews not

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,679
just

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,440
the contributors of the code but also

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,080
the merge requests and all of that

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,200
because

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,039
it allows us to capture a bit how people

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
behave in general what's their role and

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,320
especially for senior developers

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,880
and how they evolve we see david that

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,519
has assumed a more managerial position

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,480
whereas

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,240
is contributing code and then making

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,679
cleanups and all of that so it's very

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,360
it's two different

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,519
it's two different approaches it's a

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,440
very senior developers and

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,640
and it's it's it's something that we've

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,760
only been able to see

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,399
we've combined two views for

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:06,080
tricks well as i said commits

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,039
their own probably aren't enough to

00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,480
really evaluate someone's centrality

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,440
and well a single metric well

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,720
there's too much why in a single so so

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,360
it's important to have

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,360
to look at generally how the community

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,760
behaves

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,200
and well as for the community it has a

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,720
complex history with a couple of

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,320
decompression phases

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,799
that are visible but it's healthy

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,000
overall recruit recruiting is going well

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,799
and well retention

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,720
picks up in the last couple of years uh

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,279
first the projects

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,960
um they have their own trends but it's

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,080
pretty close to the whole

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,720
well at least where we've looked but but

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,120
as a whole the community is very healthy

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,519
and

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,880
finally get lab seems to be very big for

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,840
kde

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,720
mrs are picking up and well we look

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,320
forward to

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,080
to a couple of more years later we'd

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,720
have more data and then maybe look at

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,640
more insights

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,640
and finally what's what's in the card

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,200
for us for come then

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,879
uh we believe there is some work that

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,159
still needs to be done

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,200
on on the responsiveness plot and while

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,440
we'd like to find

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,839
ways that to match git lab accounts to

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,520
commit authors to be able to combine

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,040
different views for comments and merge

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,560
requests

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,040
that would be interesting as i said

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,599
before and finally maybe even

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,159
have a way to customize weights and

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,040
activities and network edges so maybe

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,560
contributing a whole new feature would

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,119
be something that has

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,919
a bigger way than contributing something

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,919
that's very minor

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:48,399
so that's it for us thank you for

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:51,599
listening and um

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,480
hi thank you very much uh

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,919
for this talk we have five minutes four

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,960
questions and we have

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:02,480
questions coming in right sometime

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,480
i can i can i can read you uh those

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:09,040
so david redondo asks in the chat we

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,200
thought that heiko becker was maybe in

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,079
the top because he does the version

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,480
increases

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,200
shouldn't such commits be excluded since

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,320
they somewhat

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,320
distort the picture

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:30,880
want to give a shot at it instead of oh

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:34,480
i go with that

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,440
uh were you did you say i should give it

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,040
a shot

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,440
yeah do you want to answer that oh i go

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,960
for it oh you can go for it that's okay

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:46,000
all right uh so yes

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,760
one of the reasons uh so definitely uh

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,240
that's definitely something where you

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,119
want

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,839
to actually exclude those uh it was

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,359
easier

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,200
i mean because we had stuff like this

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,400
right but that used to be under

00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,119
different accounts or that it used to be

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,440
uh via the account of a butt doing this

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,599
right

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,720
i remember for instance david 4 doing

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,400
this kind of

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:12,320
release work uh and you don't see the

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,200
comments coming really from him so then

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,119
they have a very well known name which

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,800
is about name and for those birds we

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,920
actually have exclude

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,280
rules in this case that's actually other

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,800
because you don't want to remove him

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,480
completely from the picture as well so

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,400
you cannot just say well that's him so

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,680
we just shoot his commits out and we

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,839
don't display them

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,599
uh so definitely yes that's used with

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:37,280
the picture that makes things

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,760
a bit harder because

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,119
you cannot divide between these two

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,280
activities fairly easily

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,280
right

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:51,920
okay thank you we have another question

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,560
again from david redondo for the gitlab

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,960
stats

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,680
i think it would make sense to keep in

00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,400
mind that

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,040
only some projects moved to it in the

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,760
beginning

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,960
and then the bulk did only start using

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,760
it later

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,160
yes uh that's what we tried to show

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,119
right when you see that big break in the

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,119
trend

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,160
uh that's actually what we were trying

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,720
to point at right

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,240
you would see uh that in the beginning

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,000
it was just ramping up

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,560
and then suddenly you see like everyone

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,599
else coming in

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,839
so yeah that definitely shows

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,560
okay and last one do you think uh also

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,640
from david redondo by the way

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,800
do you think it's possible to extract

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,359
certain roles from the data for example

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,000
querying for developers who do more of a

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,359
managerial

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,960
role like david4

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,640
i'm not sure i got the question

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,520
correctly

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,599
so i i think just looking at the data

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,359
can you and now have a query that

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,920
segregates people into managerial roles

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,960
and

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,000
another or different roles that you even

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,000
didn't think about yet

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,200
i think that's doable to make scripts

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,839
which actually detects right based on

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,560
some

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,440
profile uh in that particular case

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,800
that's

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,480
in a way easy right

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,960
because there's a strong disconnect

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,599
between the centrality when you look at

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,160
the commit

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,079
and the centrality uh when you look at

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,920
the merge request right so

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,200
if you compare those over time and you

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,960
see that diverge

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,400
in some direction then you can say

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,520
clearly the role of that person

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:41,920
is changing right as a remember trend

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:41,920
