the supporting members who

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,040

economically as well as in

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:04,319
some capacities the kdav

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:06,239

support the

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,440
kd polls at large um

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
we've been trying to improve this this

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,000
program by

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,720

look into alternatives but

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:47,120

of these uh conversations this is

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,320
mostly a space where well we

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,600
first update on what we've been up to

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,120
during the last few months

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,039
or ever since the last meeting anyway

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,319
and we have discussions on

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,160
how certain things could be done better

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,600
not that much on the kd product

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,680
themselves but

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,520
affiliations as a as an organization

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,000
i'm sure that it makes a whole lot of

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,000
sense to go through all of them

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,039
but if you're an organization and you

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,560

work closely with kde modelers that

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,000
possibility

we can be a member of your organization

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,120

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,479
for example for

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:35,039

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,959
kde network

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,440
set up and it already started in india

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,680
with some successful stories there and

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,360
and it's now being built in china and

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,079
as well uh

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,120
in india specifically there has been

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,120
they have been establishing

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
relationships with the public officials

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,880

applications into

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,399
some public schools and other

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,480
institutions and also

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,079
we started participating in events in

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,839
china

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,200
specifically in india there seems to be

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,360
an increasing number of committed

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,320
contributors coming from

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,920

work on documentation

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,920
uh api documentation um

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,600
is sort of the the main focus but we'll

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,040
also be looking at uh application

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,600
documentation

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,600
uh this is a process we started in 2018

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,160
where we had an analysis done

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,839
of what our documentation provides and

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,600
what is needed

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,519
carl is going to be working on on the

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,000
tooling support

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
to modernize our tool chain make things

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,120
nicer in general

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,399
and frederick has been reaching out to

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,519
various parts of the community

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,760
to actually collect the work

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,680
for uh improving the actual

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,320
documentation

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,839
so that's uh yeah they've they just

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,079
started

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,839
two weeks ago uh they have a number of

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,480
buffs here at academy

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,200
so you can chime in give them more

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,560
information

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,199
and work together to make kitty better

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,639
if we can move on um another way of

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,920
making kitty better is

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,320
hey our favorite event academy um

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,120
we were originally going to try to have

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,720
academy 2021 in person because we used

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,959
to be optimists

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
we are still optimists so hey let's try

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,839
it again

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:03,440
uh academy 2022 we'll plan to have it

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,199
in person somewhere we've now got so

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,320
much experience with doing

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:11,680
um this kind of online event that uh

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,720
we'll be searching for the balance

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,480
of uh real life and

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,880
online to make it easier for everyone to

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
attend

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,959
once the call for papers or call for

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:27,600
locations is out

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:31,120
hey maybe it should be near your place

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:35,040
moving on um

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,240
in 2021 hey academy uh didn't happen in

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,920
real life and

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,519
our usual activities are a lot of

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,440
sprints because it's important to bring

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,120
the kde community together

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,639
um sprints didn't happen much you can't

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,040
get together and sit together and

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,240
spread diseases together so we didn't do

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,199
that much we had a couple of

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,600
online events um you see the list is

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,839
fairly short here on the screen

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,639
um i don't know whether that's because

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,720
people

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,440
didn't organize things or whether it's

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,920
just so easy to get together online now

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,120
that nobody bothered to call it a real

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,000
sprint

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
um the board gets together regularly you

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,720
see that where

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:20,399
we love our administrative get-togethers

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,279
moving on um conferences and trade shows

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,600
there's also a big

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,959
big event for the kdev we all we love

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,519
going to fosdem

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,000
and well fosdem like everything else in

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,839
the

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,680
online world or in the free software

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,920
world uh

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,920
turned online so let's try that again

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,440
we're planning to be there

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,839
in february uh when the weather is

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,839
cold

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,680
our own conferences hey we organized

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
academy 2020 and it was great and now

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,240
we're organizing academy 2021

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,600
and it's going to be great um and in

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,160
between we had the

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,120
linux app summit uh that's largely uh

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,920
thanks to

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,959
alesh and other people so i just get to

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,399
talk about it

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,680
um but the uh

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,480
las uh was quite a success uh both years

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,720
um

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,440
las 2021 was just what two weeks ago

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,240
recently in any case so those those

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,639
continue to be

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:24,320
a uh good events for kde

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,360
moving on somebody else

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,000
that's me all right fundraising so

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,759
our fundraising strategy has mostly

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
remained the same in the last year as it

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,240
was also in the previous years with

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,079
our primary income sources being the

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,560
individual donations as well as

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,440
donations from supporting members

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,000
both individuals and also companies and

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,839
in general

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,440
those sources have continued to develop

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,519
very well

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,880
that is not something we take for

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,040
granted because

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,120
we just had the global pandemic and the

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,440
money was tight for a lot of folks

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,600
but apparently and at least in our

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,279
network and in our audience

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,959
folks felt actually more generous as a

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,240
result so

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,760
we've seen an increase there and there

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,439
will be more details later in the

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,559
financial working group report and the

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,799
following slot

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,720
and there's nice charts and so on so i'm

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,079
not going to much detail beyond that

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,640
right now

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,000
um we did contract out for the work for

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,079
cvcrm which is

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,319
the web application that we use to

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,679
manage the supporting memberships for

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,400
kdev

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,880
um mostly we've done upkeep there we

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,039
also

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,720
always wanted to do additional feature

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,880
development there to make

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
life easier and give more options to

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,840
supporting members

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,840
such as setting their own amount

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,880
unfortunately that still didn't get done

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,640
this year

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,640
and they're not so happy with that

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,760
application anymore as alicia mentioned

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,480
earlier we may

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,240
start looking into alternatives there

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,039
we've seen some interesting

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,640
experiments there in the wider community

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,039
such as the new website that

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,480
krita is using and let's say that's

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,960
inspiring

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,520
and we did um also not quite done yet

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,480
sorry

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,760
back to this line i'm not a long-winded

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,559
speaker sorry

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,400
um we did not do any campaigns again we

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,320
didn't feel the need and in general we

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,960
think that's more something to do

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,280
when you have a specific purpose in mind

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,520
um which we didn't this year

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,919
so we haven't done campaigns now the

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,919
next time

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,160
next i gave you powers oh my god

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,880
fantastic

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,720
now i can speak all right um this is

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,480
more by the way you can also find in our

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,799
annual report which we did manage to

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,520
release in time for academy this year

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,360
that includes many reports from all

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,039
sorts of corners within the community

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,360
and from many ev working groups

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,559
so please do check that out it's been

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,520
pretty great

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,080
once again it was a pretty exciting day

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,480
um

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,280
make a living so lydia touched on this

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,120
earlier

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:58,480
we did within the eve and its membership

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,000
fairly exciting activity um this year

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
which was um to start thinking more and

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
more

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,760
what we could do with our large

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
accumulated resources and how we could

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,679
invest them in a way

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,480
that might actually promote growth with

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,760
in the

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,480
ev but also in the community

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,440
at large we called this make a living

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,000
and what we did

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,039
was um interviewed many members of the

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,640
community

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:27,120
on their input what they thought

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,679
we might be able to do to allow more

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,160
people

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,440
to do kde work for a living to make it

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,919
more sustainable

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,200
um what we found in the past is that

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,360
very often

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,360
you know once activity within kde fits

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,880
into a certain life stage and then once

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,880
you exit that live stage

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,400
and it gets tough to keep up that

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,840
activity level um

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,760
at the same level and one way to

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,919
mitigate that is to actually do it for a

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,400
living and find a job doing kde and that

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,400
is

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,440
exactly what we want to promote around

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,679
the ecosystem

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,360
we want more of the partners that we

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,840
have the corporates

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,720
um to create kde jobs because they feel

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,840
that's a worthwhile thing for them to do

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,159
and um maybe that is not the only idea

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,760
maybe there are also other ways to

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,280
create more kidney jobs

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,880
so we did the survey on that and we

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,000
collected answers and

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,000
we produced some er style conclusions

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,200
and some initial recommendations

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,080
and what we came up with um was a new

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,720
set of contractors that kde will hire

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,120
and um that are intentionally designed

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,360
to

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,480
actually create some new funding sources

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,840
for kdb

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,520
so that in the first place we can

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,799
sustain those positions

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,440
uh but also hopefully make kd technology

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,159
more attractive to adopt by others and

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,559
then

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,600
further spreading more job creation and

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,120
uh lydia and

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,799
neurofutures will give a talk on this

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,960
later in the academy program in much

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,120
greater detail so hopefully that

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,480
created some appetite and attending the

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,720
talk because i think it would be very

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,600
interesting

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,120
uh working groups so the kde has many

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
working groups that

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,960
tend to different aspects of our

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,440
activities and

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,360
try to do certain activity to

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,120
you know help the community in that area

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,320
and do that with a certain

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,120
level of continuity and quality example

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,960
is the financial working group and also

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,480
the fundraising working group

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,120
and those are dear to my art is the

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,799
treasurer but we have many more

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,640
and we've always been trying to improve

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,000
the working groups every year and make

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,039
them more effective

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,880
and this year we went through somewhat

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,360
more elaborate process on that

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,480
we interviewed them all of the existing

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,080
working groups

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,840
and essentially asked them to describe

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,000
themselves how they do their work and

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,679
how they see their responsibilities

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,039
how they handle certain things like

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,240
succession

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,000
and similar and

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,360
then we analyzed that and then did some

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,919
soul-seeking on it

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,799
and something that we found is that

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,720
the working groups have some challenges

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,440
and

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,080
they do very important work but often

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,799
that work

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,880
can feel less rewarding than working on

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,720
a more regular kde project does

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,720
and one of the reasons is that that work

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,840
is often done sort of behind

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,520
the scenes behind those doors without

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,039
getting that regular feedback from the

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,320
community as you do

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,720
if you for example work on an

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,039
application um they

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,960
lack that visibility and and therefore

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,159
working in them is less rewarding

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,080
um so we realized that um we've kind of

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,520
maybe all known all along how to make

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,240
the working groups more effective and

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,559
make it a

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,159
more enjoyable place to work in and

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,080
making them more like

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,919
regular kde projects are and we've

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,840
written that down and explained it and

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,720
given some recommendations to the work

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,840
as a result in the form of our part and

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,080
we hope they

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,880
they find that useful for their work and

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,200
that

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,320
it will make it easier for them going

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,919
forward

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,799
to do their very important work for the

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,799
kde community

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,600
um so those activities were certainly

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,360
also some of our personal highlights of

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,559
the year but there were many others

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,240
um very cool was to see

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,320
one of our patrons which is a hardware

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,840
device the time phone

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,760
um together with the plasma mobile

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,280
community and i think

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,960
that um too many was um a culmination of

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,440
a many years long effort

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,480
um to make plasma mobile ready for a

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,120
wider audience

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,600
and i think the community also learned a

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,480
lot

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,799
working with a hardware vendor even

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,559
better is that the pinecone is just

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:47,279
one example of several we've seen

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,720
in general kde technology get adopted in

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,400
more and more devices and

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,440
more and more companies being interested

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,840
in shipping devices with kd technology

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,520
i don't think that 10 years ago many

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,960
people would have anticipated that when

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,960
we were more

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,320
sort of had all our eggs in the desktop

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,679
basket so to speak

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,679
um i think we've expanded and created

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,360
a lot of new abilities and skills and

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,159
experience there in the community and

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,320
that's

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,600
really cool to see and i think it's

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,120
going to be exciting

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,480
what will come from that track in the

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,440
future um

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,240
we were also super super super happy and

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,559
grateful

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,120
to see how well the community has done

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,600
under really difficult circumstances

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,880
from in the last year during the global

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,520
pandemic

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,559
um in almost every way and on every

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,400
level

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,159
people rose to the challenge of setting

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,520
up the infrastructure that we needed for

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,559
virtual events

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,600
um people attended those events

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,480
at a good clip and enjoyed them our

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,279
income

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,880
has remained very stable as mentioned

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,679
donations have been grown during the

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,440
pandemic

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,200
sorry by the way a bit of a throwback in

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,400
the last few days so my voice is

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,159
actually

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:03,679
going to hell right now so that um

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,600
turned out to be really wonderful to see

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,200
nevertheless i think we're all very very

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,279
grateful that um

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,960
the state of the pandemic seems to be

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,960
improving in many areas of the world and

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,000
that we can return to physical events

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,880
hopefully in the coming

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,960
year and next to lydia i think

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,480
while we talk about things to be

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,520
grateful for and

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,799
celebrate quick reminder

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,919

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,720
there for me to figure out that i needed

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,799
to click the button sorry about that

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,840
um i'm going to talk about other

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,799
people's

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,279
achievements again um what we said we

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,520
would do

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,200
and what we actually managed to get done

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,320
each year during this talk

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,080
uh we give a sketch of hey what are we

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,919
going to do in the next year what would

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,480
kdev like to achieve last year we said

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,559
these things we'd like to come back

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,039
together well obviously that kind of

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,200
fell

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,039
apart the world still doesn't allow

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,159
everything uh to happen the way we would

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,880
like it to

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,000
um and that's why you earlier saw a

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
couple of slides with

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,279
let's do that again well let's try it

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,279
again

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,600
um so this is going to come back on our

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,240
what are we going to do this year

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,320
sheet last year we said we would be

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,960
working towards sustainable funding well

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,400
you heard

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,240
aika say that we've made

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,240
great strides towards that there's still

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,880
some additional things to be done

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,559
this slide still talks about uh using

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,600
civi crm

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:17,520
where and as ike said we're

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,559
weighing it in the balance make a living

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,559
the third item on this slide uh well

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,720
you've you've seen we're going to be

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,880
hiring people we've

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,799
figured out what we want to do and how

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,039
we're going to move that forward

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,840
to also help out with the sustainable

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,880
funding

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,200
situation more things we said we would

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,720
do

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,399
we would be supporting an open source

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,360
friendly hardware ecosystem well

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,080
we've welcomed point 64 and slim book to

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,600
our

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,919
patrons so we've definitely made steps

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,360
there

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,720
i think we mission accomplished there

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,720
but just because that mission is

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,440
accomplished doesn't mean we need to

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,520
sit down and the last thing we said we

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,200
were going to try for the past year was

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,600
copy and boost what works

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,559
that really reflects on the uh on the

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,240
working groups

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,120
where uh we're enthusiastic about what

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,679
they

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,640
do and the the importance of the topics

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,760
they choose

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,399
um but not all of them work as well as

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,360
as they might and as i said we're

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:22,559
continuing to

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,559
to massage that to uh

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,640
so we got maybe halfway on that last

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,720
point

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,760
so that's me looking at the past now we

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,600
move on to neo

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,600
who can talk about the future

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,120
thanks eight so yeah talking about like

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,200
some things that we think are important

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,559
and we plan to focus upon going forward

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,720
for the next year

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,840
uh lilly already mentioned the make a

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,640
living initiative

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,960
um we need to fill in the positions we

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,880
prepared and proposed

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,200
make sure these people the new

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,000
contractors they integrate probably into

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,000
our community

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,760
and start being productive and they

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,240
apply it to our products

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,320
and see if there are any new areas where

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,440
kd can get into

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,720
that we need to explore

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,360
this goes with the organizational growth

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,520
of course

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,520
our eb is getting bigger the

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,480
organization is growing a lot

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,080
uh so this brings additional effort to

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,960
in order to attack adjust

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,360
and adopt find figure out new processes

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,640
figure out new tools for collaboration

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,720
and all those logistics um one of our

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,440
key goals that we discussed a lot in the

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,679
recent past has been on getting kde

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,679
members to help more and we want to

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,640
push for that more so if you are a kde

and we need your help in order to

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,279
continue growing and in order to

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,840
have a more sustainable organization

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,919
scheme around the idea

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,320
if you are not an eg member to consider

take over maybe some initiative in

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,360
assigning some tasks to yourself joining

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,120
a working group

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,559

use all the help we can we can get

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,640
um so what we want to achieve then is

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,559
that

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,840
more and more members of the are more

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,840
active as re members

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,600
they are making meaningful contributions

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,399
through the eb members through ev

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,720
membership

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,840
and help the board and the other people

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,840
in the working groups to

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,760
run the whole association

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,799
i have presenter so i can go to the next

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,039
slide

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,039
we have this thing called last year as i

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,679
mentioned we want to try again we want

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,840
to bring

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,399
our community back together the the

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,080
bandwidth in in-person meetings is huge

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,919
and we believe this can be very

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,000
productive for our community for our

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,120
people for building relationships

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
so hopefully both academy and

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,440
all our other upcoming sprints will be a

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,640
good opportunity for that

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,799
in the next year and another

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,760
big topic is the partners or hardware

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,519
partnerships

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,799
i think it was i cannot mention that we

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,399
have managed to build some very good

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,080
ones over the past year

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,840
we want to continue and improve all

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,320
those partnerships

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,480
explore new areas and continue to work

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,200
with businesses and professionals around

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,480
kde so we have a good network of people

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,320
and experts in our around us and

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,399
built on top of all the experience we

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,159
gave so far in order to reach

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:38,159

so this was short of 30 minutes

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,600

no vitos will be staying and who's

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,880
joining uh

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,960
as well we have

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,880
several people joining from the

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,960
different uh working groups

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:46,480
um among them thomas frederick

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,480
david busan

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:53,359
and olaf oh my that's a lot

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,359
um this will be a big show

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,240
oh um as as people were

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,640
leaving uh a question came up in the

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,800
uh in the widget maybe maybe let's say

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,680
if it's not a problem that's another

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,000
problem

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,560
are the contractors full-time or

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,480
part-time

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,680
so they are in general part-time

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,599
one of the reasons is that

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,200
they are contractors and at least in

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,880
most jurisdictions

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,480
contractors are not allowed to have a

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,200
single client

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,000
so unless you enjoy working far more

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,240
than you should

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,200
it's it's strange to have multiple

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:41,839
clients and

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,839
work for any of them full-time

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,480
