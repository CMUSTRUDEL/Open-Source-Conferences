first of all Marco is a pleasure for me

00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,410
to have you here it's a pleasure for me

00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,550
to have Tomas have you Tomas here too

00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,600
and the trick should have some extra for

00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:59,150
this

00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,990
so guys I even know the people guys so

00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:06,020
nice to meet you welcome to my channel

00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:08,229
so pure game is Akili is lightweight

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,800
user interface framework for mobile and

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:15,050
conversion applications right so could

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:47,140
you tell Leo more about this technology

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:53,959
and its relationship with technologies

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:57,530
is the main tool kit for used by plasma

00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:03,650
mobile as well but you can use it also

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:09,230
on plasma desktop or any Linux desktop

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:16,030
environment as well on Android and

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:22,489
Windows and Macintosh it's built

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:26,030
technology time by done by kit on which

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:31,810
extends its with more high level

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:38,019
controls like a set of Lego blocks for

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:41,450
building applications it's also not only

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:46,150
pure techno technology the framework but

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:51,800
it's also set of interface guideline and

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:55,750
design concept the acknowledged

00:03:51,800 --> 00:04:02,630
Shikha framework is a way to easily

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:04,670
implement those guidelines Tomas I would

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,980
like to say something instead of Katie

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,080
we already have a lot of vacations that

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,330
our butyl talk of crema Gani so if

00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,540
people don't believe that kilogram we

00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,850
can be used for for we obligations that

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,820
is actually completely false because we

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,680
already have those so the system

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,630
settings inside of Katie and now it's

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,960
completely Carrigan they discover the

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,640
application starter is also carry gaming

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,490
one of the first scary game users was

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,890
actually outside of Cadiz so Marcos and

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,350
a few hours creating Carrigan he was

00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:39,140
really fast creating it and then little

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,800
stir balls adapted it so sub-surface

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,960
runs on kirigami for Android and iOS and

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,550
I believe that this is something that is

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,780
quite huge because you know that limo is

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,410
usually somebody that is quite vocal

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:58,360
about things that he hates

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,360
never is creative against kirigami

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:10,340
android genome iOS elements do isms

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,590
and this is something that the JDK

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,080
people is just struggling Church to have

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,950
these you don't have a working

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,050
application on mobile for instance so if

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:24,560
you are targeting your application to

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:29,240
anything to make Windows Linux Android

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:34,040
iOS is to release it once you can use

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,610
kirigami oh okay that's what we would

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:42,470
like to say something

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:46,010
so after kiss we Gani with test

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,200
interface for a TD for the ons that do

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,790
not know italia project is project

00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,690
shield

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:56,180
clearly technology to use 3d printers

00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:00,440
and right now we are working to control

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:03,590
cnc as well the idea is to use kreega me

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,639
is to allow the control of the 3d 3d

00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,129
printers we are self on

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,349
tablets and desktops with the same base

00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,909
coat and I think that's the most

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:14,729
important part because you don't need a

00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:18,120
huge team to to make everything

00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:21,870
compatible with Android iOS Windows

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,710
Linux and Mac you can use the same code

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:29,360
bags codebase to work with everything in

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:33,029
the main idea also was to be able to use

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,150
low-cost computers as old cell phones or

00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:39,960
old single board computers to control

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:44,129
the 3d printers and kirigami shows that

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,830
it is totally possible to do to read the

00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:50,370
API or to run the control of the 3d

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,550
printers without a huge usage of the

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:56,819
processor and being able to use it

00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:01,189
without any problems in low hardware or

00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:04,319
low-end hardware so I just example I

00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:08,430
created a small fast graphic interface

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:13,610
and I was able to use a 3d viewer we I

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:18,509
don't know ten thousand ten thousand

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:21,779
points in a 3d object with 60fps in a

00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:23,759
low-end telephone because you can watch

00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:27,020
and see the 3d object while it's

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,500
printing by your cell phone and that was

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,750
really good

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,740
it was the same graphic interface

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:38,569
working desktop and cell phones it to me

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,310
it's like the best use case to create a

00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:44,339
application for everybody in any

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:49,020
hardware oh this is great this is great

00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:51,689
and I just want to comment I think that

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,080
it's important for people to know and

00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:57,560
you correct me if I'm wrong - okay at

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,289
least started from in Brazil it's right

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:06,589
yeah that's right it started we odd

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:09,539
project called Pierre print after that

00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:12,990
after some problems with some developers

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:15,180
the project was moving to KDE we've

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,389
started with a new name called a Tilley

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,110
air and so we have the a clear project

00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,270
you

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,599
under the Italian project we have

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,669
another one call it a geek are in

00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,300
everything started from Brazil we've

00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:34,349
we've many Brazilian developers and

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,450
right now we have mainly on the blocker

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:40,229
in United States we have another trans

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,610
guys in Arab and around the globe so the

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,310
project is working fine we have

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,470
companies that are looking with good

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,120
eyes are using the search business to

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,390
provide new tools to provide new

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,610
products and we are having a lot of help

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,940
from that so it's it's going really fine

00:08:53,610 --> 00:09:00,180
for us one thing that I would like show

00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,459
ads on that is that there are already

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:06,269
quite a few applications built on top of

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:10,200
84 so we just discovered that somebody

00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:12,510
used at 84 inside of his university

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,360
projects show control some kind of

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,620
machine so it is really nice to know

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,890
that an application that it's not

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,890
mainstream has been pick it up and it's

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:26,339
been widely used I really did not know

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:36,839
that there is a place for applications

00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:39,690
already after using the code in like

00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,660
raspberries to control these 3d printers

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,339
and there is a paranoid I know three

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,699
companies that we recognize that and

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,529
there are more companies working in any

00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:52,860
other project and as you said in your

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:55,680
besties as well and that is awesome and

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,089
that is also perhaps using a little bit

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,420
of the interface that we created on

00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:04,160
Creegan and the project is not always

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,160
like only thank you

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:12,600
nice congrats for the project thank you

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:15,570
what do I need to transform an existing

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:28,980
application development with 2t into a

00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:32,690
mobile friendly and conversion and how

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,690
the application was written

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:41,130
the traditional cute desktop application

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:46,790
use a technology called cue widgets

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:53,880
which sadly is not really compatible

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:58,470
which is me when I Ward but if your

00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,350
application was pretty well written and

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,200
you did a good the separation between

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:09,210
the business logic of what the

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:13,700
application actually does and just a GUI

00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:18,170
the layout of widgets for it then it

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:23,130
becomes not much if not really difficult

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:29,630
for instance if your application have a

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:33,330
green light on water called models

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:37,770
that's the way that you two uses to

00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:39,840
represent lists long lists of of data

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,870
for instance of the file in your file

00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:49,670
system for for a file manager and so on

00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:54,210
those in humulin kirigami as as they are

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:58,440
with very little modification little

00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:01,410
clean or modifications they're things

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:06,210
that are pre pretty more heavily

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:11,270
graphical they may be a bit more work

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:18,030
but it should be it shouldn't be that

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:26,670
that much work we had some examples

00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:30,620
already we have we just we just heard

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:34,970
about about a couple of examples now

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:38,360
yeah the task if we is doing that now

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:44,470
with our new silicon recitations

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:46,390
subsurface also that was born

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,780
she Ridgid application but it was

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:58,050
actually born as a education but more

00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:58,050
interesting also conversation which is

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:10,620
Katie time for IRC is now is now porting

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:13,630
its user interface to kirigami without

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,810
without touching pretty much nothing

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:19,450
objects business logic and in the

00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:27,580
process it's also having a support for

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:34,960
matrix a good thing that's in the

00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:40,170
process we also are now porting the most

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:42,850
of our system settings modules so the

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,450
system settings is the application that

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:50,770
you use to configure your plasma desktop

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:54,010
it has many modules at work seems to use

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:58,590
what points to use and so on and we are

00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:02,500
working one by one of those modules to

00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:05,110
humulin kirigami but also also there are

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:09,730
more most of the business logic let's

00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:12,490
suppose that I started closing KCM

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,830
settings from KDE like two months ago it

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,560
should be like 50 lines of code but I

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:26,770
forgot to finish and that's why just we

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:28,630
can structure to improve demos there is

00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,370
two things that it what my work asked us

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:34,390
to do on your mouse KCM that here am

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,910
using that XFC has so we get so bit

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,860
better than XFC it's also one thing that

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,020
i would like to talk about on the court

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,130
in the subsurface to kirigami because

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,870
there is one thing that you need

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:47,550
subsurface that it's not parted because

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:52,750
it would be too much trouble

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:56,050
subsurface is heavily based on graphical

00:14:52,750 --> 00:15:00,220
data so we have a ton of plots in there

00:14:56,050 --> 00:15:02,860
I really did not find anything true on

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:08,649
how to draw those charts on key regard

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:09,610
there is a few and they are the

00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:13,089
successful

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:17,910
I'm sorry it's a miracle yeah probably

00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:23,560
build something nice maybe out of the

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:26,020
new shapes module you know with

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,820
that you Kate you can you can draw

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:36,690
arbitrary splines and things like that

00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:39,850
which are and as a vertical or fast

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:43,480
though I'm gonna try to part but when I

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,670
when I built there was this didn't

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:51,790
existed so ahead should do something to

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:54,070
use the graphical interface really

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:58,029
really reasons and I started this for

00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:02,770
subsurface in cute 5.5 or 5.4 so it's

00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:05,350
like really old I figured out that it

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:08,190
can basically get a QB tickets that it's

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:11,950
ready for the desktop and do a little

00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,810
wrap around it and then use it even

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,660
though WITSEC use we did it for the stop

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:20,170
you can display that in kirigami

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:22,390
interface of course you lose quite a few

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:26,260
things so if you need mouse inputs or if

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:28,990
you needs keyboard control that will be

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,060
way more hard than what I did because I

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:34,720
basically just exported the painting and

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:38,980
for that it's working like a charm so if

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,160
I took on desktop you can still try to

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,730
use the the key video gets on KML like I

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,620
did

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:49,899
yeah you can as for a supporting aid

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:54,250
there is this thing that is called a cue

00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:59,170
painted item on which you can recycle or

00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:02,860
your cue painter custom painting coat it

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:06,370
will not be such as fast if you are not

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,860
doing animations with it it's fine and

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:13,179
it's working

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:17,260
yeah and it it makes it significantly

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:21,809
helps the protein process right so is

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:25,589
there not any easy way to bring

00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:31,299
applications from other technologies

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:36,240
like gtk true kirigami without doing a

00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:39,820
very hard implementation of the deck

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,130
well that is not true because if the

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,010
application is well define it from the

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,350
beginning the interface and the core

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,470
logic will have different code paths so

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,899
you just need to create yet another

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,639
interface on top of the core so yeah you

00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:56,789
would need to rewrite everything from

00:17:54,639 --> 00:18:00,159
scratch but just for the interface and

00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:03,880
Kirika interface is really really easy

00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:08,049
to write is not a lot of lines of code

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,389
should basically not so if you want to

00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:12,130
do the should do list there is a really

00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:15,039
famous JavaScript application for

00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:17,590
demonstration purposes one written in

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,450
KML is less than 100 lines of code a

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,870
complete application you know i cuz then

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:27,159
powerball Tattaglia totally has already

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:30,250
a great user interface for desktops we

00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:33,669
started to write it to curie gammy some

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:37,510
time ago and it was really fast because

00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:41,169
has Thomas at the back end was already

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:43,419
provided by a geek or so to write the

00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:46,990
graphic user interface with Curie gammy

00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:50,200
we just need you to Harriet what already

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:53,019
exists another crafty user interface to

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:58,690
kirigami it was already fast because of

00:18:53,019 --> 00:19:01,960
the cube al abstraction and with a good

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:05,139
API with a good car season like eighty

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,490
car it was really easy to hit create the

00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:10,090
graphical user interface

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:13,630
it's a very nice is case to show people

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:16,690
and that is possible and it's not so

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:21,220
complicated if the base of the

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,480
application and was well structured so

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,690
what you're thinking it's

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,590
part you have kirigami in mind for a

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:32,530
project that I started today so if I am

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:35,560
I am a developer and I would like to

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:39,310
start a new project with cadiz

00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:42,940
technology should I start with kirigami

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:47,470
in mind developer with this this

00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:51,400
framework as the poll from my station

00:19:47,470 --> 00:20:11,530
what we know about it depends also from

00:19:51,400 --> 00:20:20,650
the application you you are getting a

00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:28,350
modern framework which feature wide can

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:33,610
can compare to other modern platforms

00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:36,040
then from from Android or from Apple

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:39,780
from like the new Microsoft you want

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:45,480
they all have that one thing in common

00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:50,950
all day all the drawing they do it's

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:54,690
it's graphically accelerated which is a

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:59,190
thing that wasn't considered back then

00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:05,910
when the first versions of killed in GDK

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:09,850
were were designed because there wasn't

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:15,280
Hardware ready for that but now that we

00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:19,390
do you can do just just simply a better

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:24,060
user experience with Kim Electric a me

00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:27,100
and you will probably want to be

00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:29,850
multiplied made across from as well you

00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,740
will probably want to have a mobile

00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:35,650
version of the application

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:39,120
on which

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:41,440
you have to use a camera at this point I

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,540
would say that even if you're not

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,170
targeting KD technology scary gum is a

00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,150
good choice

00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,280
and there is quite a few people that

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,380
believes that they don't want target

00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,870
something towards KD because there are

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,510
just so many seeded technologies

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:58,990
involved and it's heart you should do

00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:01,120
something that it's completely Katie but

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,400
you don't need to do that you can choose

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,960
kirigami and use just kirigami from the

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,360
K different works and target your

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,210
application just on top of that and I

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,020
work it with a dick in main software's

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:16,840
that are completely KML the interface is

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,940
100% KML and the application was running

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,040
everything I would say for instance

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,450
something that we mean Patrick discussed

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,970
that should either kill ground cultural

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:28,420
it does not use Kerrigan it created its

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,520
own set of confusing because it wanted

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,260
to have a complete culture of the look

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,230
and feel but if it did there are

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,260
controls that they create their code

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,000
base word sharing can have I believe

00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:43,420
because we already have a lot of things

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,020
that they are using and this one

00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:50,260
cultural thing it works anywhere and it

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,690
works fast it works even faster than a

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,270
normal application created using

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,640
jessica's plus technologies like he is

00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:01,179
with cute widgets because kids with kids

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:04,270
are not video accelerators i think it's

00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:08,950
one of the questions that he asked you

00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:12,820
because today when we do not help any

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:16,420
Linux distribution in a mobile friendly

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:21,760
way rights will I think you've been to

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:24,700
phonies it was a something year that but

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:30,280
today we do not have that and the other

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:33,370
projects maybe will come from two or

00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,320
three years from now but you do have

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:41,700
plasma bioplasma boy is already working

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:45,340
I mean this way I mean in the way that

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:48,010
plasma mobile are not is not shipped in

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,670
by default in any phone today

00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,950
right we should

00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:57,110
we have Android and iOS you don't

00:23:51,950 --> 00:24:01,570
Microsoft run away from this this market

00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:05,000
so what I mean what I mean is that

00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:09,050
kirigami is very important to write

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,960
applications that could be running in

00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:15,080
those platforms we have a problem right

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,020
because we do not have Linux in those

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:23,920
fonts and native Linux in those phones

00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:25,940
to running plasma mob or other interface

00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,620
is wrong I don't know how to enter

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,330
Luneberg because I know that Katie is

00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,620
working a few companies but I have no

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:35,030
information about that I know that

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:40,010
Edition is working with us we are

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:44,390
working on plasma mobile it's at the

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:47,750
moment not our it's not our central

00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:56,200
priority but what what we want to do is

00:24:47,750 --> 00:25:02,960
to have platform as robust support that

00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:06,770
runs on on several consumer phones on

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,590
which you can you can test your

00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:12,380
applications so if you if you write an

00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,130
application with kirigami target in

00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,630
android

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:21,590
you know that without with no changes at

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:27,350
all you can compile it and test it and

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:30,980
Plasma mobile and as as we will put more

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:34,550
and more effort in plasma mobile then we

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:38,800
will get in quite a lot quite a lot of

00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,800
applications from from day one

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:46,940
basically all all all the mobile

00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:50,270
applications done by the KD project will

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:54,590
be supported impossible anybody with

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:55,670
plasma hobby right now we want to to use

00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:03,040
it most

00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:07,420
mostly for during the performance of our

00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:13,810
space and our applications to small

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:19,270
animal platforms to see what we are

00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:26,850
still missing off on own touch enabled

00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:26,850
technologies and to fix all of that and

00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:35,380
hopefully have a product that will

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:39,160
mature more and more to the point that

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:41,980
set at some point with good plasma

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:45,930
mobile together with cara mia

00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:49,240
application we will be confident to say

00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:54,660
try it as your phone it works it's not

00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:57,940
there yet but it's getting there and if

00:26:54,660 --> 00:27:02,740
more people join the project it will get

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:05,950
there faster yeah a review I think the

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:08,770
only big big problem that we have today

00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:12,450
with phones to test the plasma mobile

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:16,030
and Quran is that the manufacturers are

00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:20,680
shipping those phones more and more with

00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:25,390
the bootloader locket so here in the zoo

00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:30,000
I do not know if we have a lot of

00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:33,640
options to change the framework and

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,500
install the plasma mobile on our phones

00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:43,480
yeah fortunately there are there are

00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:47,020
producers of phones which are really not

00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:50,860
good citizens like the recent decision

00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:54,040
of the way to completely lock down the

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:58,660
bootloader that that was a bad one

00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:03,130
there still are a manufacturer that

00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:08,320
allowed one of the bootloader there are

00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:13,230
like Sony which they are this fact as a

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,230
as as an active

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:23,860
motional material they can get some

00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:26,700
pride in the fact that their phones are

00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:32,350
kind of friendly to third parties

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:36,279
operating systems but I think I think

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:39,580
the this equation would probably prove

00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:45,190
one thing that's on all of those years

00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:50,770
on on working with armed devices that I

00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:58,120
seen improving dramatically is how much

00:28:50,770 --> 00:29:04,500
better the limits support for our

00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:08,799
masseuses as as God there are several

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:13,510
several of these like a neurological

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:18,190
chip in even some stuff Ravens are very

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:21,880
close to run a few were almost you

00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:27,330
mainline kernel without third-party

00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:31,720
patches this is happening slowly but

00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:38,039
compared to some years ago there these

00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:41,590
situations already much battles a phone

00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:47,470
using distantly supporters associates

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:52,179
associate if the bootloader can be

00:29:47,470 --> 00:30:01,270
unlocked it's probably it's probably

00:29:52,179 --> 00:30:05,080
going to run over no nice and also some

00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:10,210
on in some phones you will have to still

00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:17,590
use Android dry drivers with the Hylian

00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:22,020
project which erupts Linux your user

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:26,090
space on top of Android kernel Android

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:29,820
library and trailers

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:33,720
other model are starting to directly

00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:37,680
support real linked mainline so you have

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:42,540
an actual link of distribution sold on

00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:45,300
your own without pieces of Android basic

00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,490
and Tomas would like to say something

00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:52,350
for that I really don't know what to say

00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:54,840
because I work in a sunrise like on the

00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:57,600
Android source code and even with

00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,810
Android that it's prepared to go into

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,590
many kind of humors it was horrible to

00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:06,720
flesh so I can't imagine when what

00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:09,360
people working with the plasma boba like

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,310
in the core team are suffering and I

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,140
really appreciate that there are some

00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:17,250
companies that are mechanism and

00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,650
offering a bit of pleasantness by

00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,920
offering and what headphones for us and

00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:24,810
it's not so only a problem to flash the

00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:28,050
hardware right you purity operating

00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:31,410
system that you want in such a big the

00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:33,990
harder compatibility that you need to

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:37,770
provide for everything because this is

00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:39,780
this is a bit complicated so that if you

00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:42,180
to look in cell phones the hardware is

00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,310
completely different for each mobile

00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,320
cell phone for each company for each

00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,000
hardware and for each Enterprise that

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,840
provides the harder for this cell phone

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,510
company so different of the computers

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,200
that we know the the cell phone

00:31:54,510 --> 00:32:01,140
environments a bit complicated for

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:04,380
unified rating system I would like very

00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:08,460
much to say that there is the SOC that

00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:14,300
is one chip that has the complete system

00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:18,060
and graphics Ivor's and gsm Radeon it

00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:22,310
each one of those among chips is

00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:26,100
basically its own complete environment

00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:30,800
sometimes even different models in the

00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:33,530
same company are slightly different but

00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,420
their situation is is getting better

00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:37,670
more and more Hardware is getting

00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:45,550
support that

00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:50,510
we those which for the graphics use the

00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:53,450
Molly chips are getting closer and

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:57,530
closer to an open-source driver

00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:00,410
the limo driver is a it's still not

00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:05,780
ready for primetime but getting really

00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:09,710
close to to be actually usable or draw

00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:14,510
air for driving a whale insertion mark

00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:19,400
or for a person that wouldn't like to

00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:23,660
start developing per your with cutie and

00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:28,700
2 ml and kirigami technology what Mark

00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:31,550
would like to say for them and when they

00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:34,310
could start if they want to contribute

00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:37,330
to the project or if they want to start

00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:41,770
using this technology to write their own

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:47,740
applications oh yeah I would say first

00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:52,640
first thing come talk come talk with us

00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:55,850
we have many IRC channels we are on

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,480
telegram of well we are non matrix as

00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:03,200
well many channels are breached between

00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:07,880
one or the other for instance for

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:11,780
kirigami on IRC on freenode it's KD -

00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:16,270
chiami same channel on matrix there is

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:20,540
also the city gamma channel on telegram

00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:25,010
only KD daughter web site there are

00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:29,900
lists of telegram channels IRC channels

00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:33,110
mailing lists we are for internal

00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:37,450
development we are using a lot a lot

00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:41,720
mailing lists they are all listed in the

00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:46,850
under KD websites other channels that

00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:51,330
can be useful are ours on free on

00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:56,340
freenode 3 + kv -

00:34:51,330 --> 00:35:02,150
davell plasma devil for for the

00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:06,320
development or main desktop as I say the

00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:13,950
KD - Kagame for yani

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:16,050
KD - BBG or our group of designers on

00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:19,890
which if you are working on an

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:25,440
application you can jump there and ask

00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:30,990
for ask for suggestion ask for designs

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:34,170
and you have quite a lot of very good

00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,930
designers that then can help you to make

00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:39,240
your application absolutely beautiful

00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:42,030
perfectly Tomas would like to say

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,370
something more and I think especially

00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,200
for the Brazilian people doesn't like

00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:49,230
truly start write an application with

00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:54,000
curing ami or with the they would like

00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:57,030
to contribute to the project so the

00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,510
first time did a god QE gave me the talk

00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:03,600
on it it was really simple to run the

00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:07,770
examples I - to create alter and

00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:11,160
examples it you just need to follow the

00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:13,320
readme it's not a big deal at all and

00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:18,480
you can create the entire graphic

00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:20,790
interface in your desktop only using the

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,410
display size that you want so if you if

00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,120
you use the display size that what you

00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:29,640
know you know tablet or your cell phone

00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:31,770
you can try to simulate the the look and

00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,810
feel up to your graphic user interface

00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:39,710
with we going because Krieger we will

00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:44,190
try to to work with these small size

00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:47,730
available in your screen orally so you

00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:49,770
can resize the window - to try to take a

00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,930
look how the graphic user interface we

00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:56,850
work in desktop cell phones or tablets

00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:59,460
and to be able to do that you don't need

00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,470
to do a lot of things you just really

00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:05,280
simple the examples will do that for you

00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:08,970
you can take a look and see how it goes

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:12,480
so as Marco said there is mail Easter

00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:15,170
the RSC channel you can chocolate

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,260
everybody everybody is really accessible

00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:23,010
there is no problem with simple

00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:25,440
questions or really in Star Trek

00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:28,350
questions that start development because

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,660
the documentation need to be able to

00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:33,240
provide this kind of information if then

00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,670
if someone has this kind of question is

00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,010
because the mutation need to be proven

00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,930
and I did some improvements in the crew

00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:44,130
gamma documentation when I started so

00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:45,870
that's a really good thing about open

00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,940
source projects because unique you can

00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,800
improve not only the code you can

00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,680
improve the documentation to help others

00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,800
to restart to use QE gaming or to have

00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,560
orders to to create your small programs

00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,400
to test it and it is really simple I

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,200
think the only big issue is the to shine

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,810
to chain that you need to configure it

00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:11,880
like the Android or iOS to Chan but this

00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:13,530
is it is a problem of the two chains
