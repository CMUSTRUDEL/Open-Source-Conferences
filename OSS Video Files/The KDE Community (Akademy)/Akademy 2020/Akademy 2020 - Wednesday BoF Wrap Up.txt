all right it is 21 30

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:10,320
in utc plus two 1930

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,440
in utc it's 2020

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,080
and we've just finished the sixth day of

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,640
academy i'm adrian and i'd like to tell

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,640
you

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,640
invite you to the buff wrap up

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,800
julian is already complaining that it

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,920
might not be 2020

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,920
so hey

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,439
times and dates are an opinion and

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,160
certainly if you've ever read

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,840
the k calendar core unit tests you know

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,440
that times and dates are

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,079
very opinionated um i have

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,600
three things uh that need to go in the

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,039
announcements today

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,920
one is that there's one last escape room

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,960
one last

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,800
chance to murder your

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,000
fellow academy peoples or maybe discover

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,359
the murderer

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,680
and you can do that at 20 30 utc that's

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,320
in

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,000
one i was going to say one hour it's in

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,799
59 minutes

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,760
you'll still need to register if that's

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,560
of interest

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,080
tomorrow there's a pub quiz you don't

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,840
need to sign up for the pub quiz that's

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,720
when paul and i are going to try to be

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,320
funny to

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,960
all of you and uh i'm sure adam will

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,640
and john will be there to heckle us i'd

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,159
like to remind everyone as well

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,200
that uh we ask you not to record

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,240
the buff sessions please don't record

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,280
them

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,479
we that because that puts a lot of load

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,479
on the server and we don't like it

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,960
i'm so glad that we're also arguing

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,799
about french

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,880
abbreviations for utc um

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,479
but in the meantime i'd like to invite

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,640
the people from

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,880
this morning's buff the licensing buff

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,840
andreas cortlandtoya

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,840
was running the show

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,439
hi um yeah we had a really good boss

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,479
this morning

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,319
um we talked about how to present

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,280
how to better present the licenses of

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:15,200
our applications at libraries user

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,920
um the main outcome is that we will try

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,160
to

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,400
create one or two websites it's not

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,319
clearly decided yet

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,080
mostly inspired by what the creative

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,879
commons people are doing

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,680
with a clear message um what are the

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,560
benefits

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
and what are the expectations uh when

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,080
people are using our

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,879
apple applications and libraries

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,879
splitted by

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,239
what other target groups and that we

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,400
want to use as a central

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,599
information page used from several

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,800
locations

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,599
and there is a new licensing team on the

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,560
gitlab

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:54,480
instance very starting to organize it

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,680
okay thanks andreas

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,400
it's good to see the licensing

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,599
information stuff moving forward

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,519
lots of new information there

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,360
nikolas i would like to invite you to

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:11,040
tell us about android things

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,680
so we talked about one of our favorite

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,360
linux based mobile operating systems not

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,000
the favorite

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,120
in particular we talked about our

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
tooling

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,360
that runs the binary factory and can

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,560
also help a lot when developing apps

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,200
yourself

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,680
how we can improve it how we can improve

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,360
the

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,560
workflow of developing with it and

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,640
where we need more documentation and on

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,040
the code side we talked about

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:44,400
moving forward with some ongoing work

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,360
that is right now living in several

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,200
diff different repos and where we would

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,799
like to move them to a more

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,799
canonical place in frameworks

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
all right thanks nicholas moving on from

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,720
the second

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,599
most favorite linux based mobile

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,319
operating system to

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,560
the most favorite the plasma mobile buff

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,400
was at 11 this morning

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,400
someone from the plasma mobile team

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,560
hi again hey oh we

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,560
talked about our favorite mobile

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
operating system

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
in particular first of all we talked

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,880
about

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,199
our bi-weekly blog posts that have sadly

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,560
been anything but bi-weekly

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,280
and how we can

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,479
convince ourselves to push them more

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,479
regularly

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,360
so we agreed to do them monthly now

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,160
and we talked about some aspects of the

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
presentation

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,639
of the release and how we're going to

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,199
work on them

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,680
on the technical side we talked a bit

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,639
about performance

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,600
unfortunately on the current neon images

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,960
we have

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,199
since like two weeks ago uh

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,120
pretty severe performance regression we

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,160
talked about some aspects

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,840
of that and also some

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,919
general notes on how we could

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,400
potentially improve the performance of

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,800
the whole system

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,880
then we took a look at some of the

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,680
larger outstanding tasks

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,800
and talked about how to move forward

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,759
with them

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,840
we also took a look at the tasks on our

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,520
1.0 workboard

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,120
closed some of them because they were

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,039
actually done

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,919
and for the others yeah discussed on how

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,919
to proceed there

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,320
thanks nicholas for summing up all of

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,680
our favorite

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,759
mobile operating systems after the break

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,720
things continued in sort of a hardware

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,320
effect

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:55,199
vein with the kde hardware collaboration

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,199
buff alesh you ran that show

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:06,400
yeah he's in there so we need someone

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:08,639
else to do it

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,639
please

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,400
so yeah there was a bit of a

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
summary of what our current

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,039
collaborations are

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:27,120
basically slim book and the pine people

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,440
and then we kind of went into a tangent

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,960
from hardware to software in the fact

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,560
that to be able to

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,360
talk to hardware uh

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,600
companies you need to be able to provide

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,600
the full software stack yourself and we

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
aren't doing that for we are depending

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,800
how you consider neon to be or not a

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,919
support distribution

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,240
so we had some uh discussions about that

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,520
uh

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,560
also there was some discussions about

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,039
the how we the world's moving a bit away

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,160
from

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,280
x86 to arm and we should

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:05,039
try to figure out if and how we

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,759
support arm a bit better uh

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,680
yeah that's what i remember so that

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,800
would be

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
all right thanks albert then we had the

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,199
ocular both

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,560
which was run by albert hey welcome back

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,360
hello so yeah the ocular buff we had

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,919
discussed

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,880
so there's there have been some patches

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,599
that we introduced

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,479
in the previous previous release and

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,319
they have

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,639
some nice effects but then they also

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,720
caused some regressions

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,120
there was some discussions about what to

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,520
do with them if just revert them or not

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,199
we agreed we would come up with a list

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,680
of things we want to fix it

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,599
before saying we're gonna revert them so

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,520
we are giving ourselves

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:52,479
some time before the branching for 2012

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,000
to fix those and if not we'll have to

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,479
sadly revert the changes

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
but we're hoping we're gonna fix them so

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,160
let's

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,080
hope there we wanted to talk about the

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,240
website but then we collided with the

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,360
website both so nobody from the website

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,639
team was there so we basically did not

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,360
talk about it

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,879
uh there was some considerations about

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,560
when we're moving to

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,479
q6 and framework six uh yeah we will

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,319
need to probably drop some back ends but

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:25,039
it's not very used buttons

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:27,599
so hopefully it won't hurt us very much

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,879
ah yeah we decided to stop using the

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,919
versioning we use we

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,599
like ocular is that version one one dot

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,880
something nobody knows or something so

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,800
we're gonna go just to the

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,240
2008 one or 2012

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,159
that everybody uses and that's going to

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,560
be simpler

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,000
uh cornelius joined a bit to talk about

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,680
the blue angel

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,959
thing that it seems it's going to be

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,839
using popular as one of the main

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,560
points to test how good we are with the

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,440
environment and what not

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,160
uh yeah there's a few more things i will

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,320
send the full

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,000
report to the mailing list yeah all in

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,600
all it was a very

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,080
good vote i think all right thanks

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,360
albert

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,680
it's really good when buff uh managers

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,120
send a summary to the mailing lists

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,120
because that means that everyone who's

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,720
also not here can read up on it

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,920
afterwards

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,399
um i see caillou mentioning a dedicated

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,440
blue

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,399
angel buff on friday things have been

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,200
rescheduled

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,320
anyway ocular got cruelly cut off by

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,959
much more important things like python

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,680
so christian yeah i don't know if more

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,560
important but

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,240
yeah it's important i will say so yeah

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,800
we talked many things uh

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,399
first uh i gave a overview about what

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,160
all these things about bike youth buy

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,000
side and everything so just to clarify

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,120
some misunderstanding and then

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
we started to roll some ideas um there

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
are many cool

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,080
opportunities to maybe try to make some

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,640
of the kde applications descriptible

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,160
kind of implementing some plugin system

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,640
and so on and so forth

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,079
but we needed some action points so the

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,399
first thing that we want to try

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,959
if someone here is interested in is that

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,680
we want to provide kirigami for piquet

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,920
and pie site

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,760
users so everyone can use this

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,440
delightful qml framework

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,600
to build their own desktop applications

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,000
even and so this will be kind of the

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,399
first

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,880
step and the second and third and so on

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,120
and so forth will be to see more or less

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,240
what else would be worth doing maybe

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,600
trying to improve

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,959
pi kde 5 effort that is already

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,120
there in fabric fabricator rate and

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,519
other crazy ideas about maybe having

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,279
some binding generated things a

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,320
system-wide so other people can create

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,399
bindings for

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,399
our second favorite language python

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,959
all right thank you christian that wraps

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,560
it up for

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,959
room one today

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,240
we'll move on to room two thanks alison

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,399
background and

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,880
mamalok for doing the info desk stuff

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,519
without you the conference would be much

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,839
less

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,320
thank you in room two

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
we had some of our newest kinds of

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,760
content contributors

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,800
the season of kde and google summer of

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,839
code both

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,839
run by kyo kyo are you here

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
i don't see kyle anyone else from the g

off available to tell us about it

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:57,120
i see lots of people typing so i'm gonna

00:11:52,079 --> 00:12:00,880
give it a minute

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,959
all right it seems that the gsoc buff

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,880
doesn't have someone here right now at

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,800
the buff wrap up available to talk about

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:12,399
it so let's move on to the kde web

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,399
stuff carl schwann please tell us

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,480
yes we are the website both and

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:24,079
we talked about the task in on the

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,959
fabricator board and mainly uh the

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,839
remaining

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:32,880
website to update and

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,600
often forward with uh

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,959
for example the ocular website and a few

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,519
others

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,200
or we still need to find more

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,480
contributors

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,079
because it's still a lot of work but

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,440
yeah

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,440
and that's it all right thanks carl

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,399
moving on in room two we had two hours

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,720
worth of consistency talk

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,079
consistency is one of the three kde

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,720
goals elec

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,399
voted in by the members of kdev and

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,639
members of the kde community

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,160
so it's really good to see the goals are

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,839
the consistency

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,360
goals group sitting down together

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,360
niccolo or claudius

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,720
so we talked about many topics

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,839
such as the equal sizes in the panel the

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,160
window decoration and in some ways in

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,600
what in which we could improve them the

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,160
app style the cursor

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,839
and the file managers again regarding

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,079
this we saw a presentation by

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,440
cloud use regarding consistency from a

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,240
user point of view

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,720
and then we talked about qml and kiwi

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,839
just

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,839
starting problems

00:13:52,160 --> 00:14:00,160
all right thanks niccolo

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,160
that wraps it up for room two today

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,839
so moving on

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:11,519
not for it there we go

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,160
off room three maybe this isn't binboth

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,160
nicolas

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,160
okay um

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,720
first we before the both uh

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,050
we had a brief talk with bo with walker

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,839
about some

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,120
[Music]

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,320
new new setup where

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,600
he's planning to do for uh for vector

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,120
maps for marble

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:43,600
and for okay itinerary

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,680
um then in the actual buff

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,920
we didn't take proper notes and now that

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,880
i was checking the details we covered

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,880
quite a few topics

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,120
we talked about how people can

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,120
could contribute without having actual

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,360
access to the servers

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
which should make it easier both for

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,199
people who are

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,639
already in the community and for brand

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,760
new people to kde to

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,519
help but we would like to know

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,959
what people are interested in

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,560
contributing to

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,959
so that we prioritize uh

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,880
making it easier for those particular

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:25,760
websites to be

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,160
run locally we talk briefly about our

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,160
the the new csun documentation and

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,880
getting some feedback from

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,240
people who have maybe more experience on

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,240
documenting that kind of stuff

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,880
we discuss the how

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,000
we might do the migration from kde

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,360
identity to

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,360
the new my kde

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:53,040
[Music]

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,079
then we also discuss mirror brain which

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,560
is usually

00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:02,079
used for our download mirror network

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,120
it's currently unmaintained and

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,680
we are looking for a replacement and

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
we should probably talk to other

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,920
communities

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,560
like glam or linux distributions who

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,759
probably have similar

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,279
needs and problems as us

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,399
and finally there was some discussion

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,800
about uh

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,480
whether we should have a strict

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,320
requirement of only running

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:33,519
free software on our servers if it's

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,040
really that important and

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,440
there are some cases where there's

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,959
licenses that aren't strictly free

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,959
software but don't really have any

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,680
practical

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,680
legal issues

00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,279
[Applause]

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,079
and well after all most of us went to

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,279
carl's

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:55,199
web both

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,440
that's all i guess okay thanks nicholas

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,320
i'm sure that will be a spirited

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,360
discussion

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,600
about free software or not on our

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,280
servers

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,880
moving on we have the j comprise meeting

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,880
which was run by timothy

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,280
hi sorry my webcam again doesn't work so

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,360
i'll just do audio

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,799
so we had a great meeting project

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,120
comfrey today

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,959
we covered a lot of interesting topics

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,679
uh from the

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,319
future migration to cute critic controls

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,760
too

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,720
which we want to do but we will have

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,799
particularly

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,160
issues with the calendar module which is

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,919
missing so we

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,080
need to see how to proceed uh we

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,000
discussed about how to improve the time

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,240
to switch to activities categories

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,120
because in the latest version that

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,600
increased a bit

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,760
we need to see how to improve that we

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,960
discussed of course the release plan for

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:59,200
1.0 1.0 the string freeze next week and

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,120
how we will work with the promo team to

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,039
advertise the release

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,480
we discussed about the plans for the

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,559
future admin

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:11,840
feature we basically just

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,720
made a plan how to proceed and we

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,960
discussed

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,240
about the future localized data set

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,559
feature

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,400
which we'll actually we'll need the

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,039
first that we have the admin

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,200
part so user from around the world can

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,360
create their own data set and

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,559
share it so we can integrate some of

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,080
those

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,720
we discussed about the user manual

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,960
that we are going to generate and we

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,840
need to improve a bit

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,520
degeneration and we need more feedback

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,160
from translators

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,679
to see where strings need context and

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,720
more feedback from teachers

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,320
for activities and

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,320
other stuff that's it

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,960
all right thank you timotey that

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,880
wraps it up for room three today moving

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,679
on to room four

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:10,799
we have jose fonda

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:15,200
um jose and meven they talked about rust

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,200
rust never sleeps so here's yours

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,520
you are on mute

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,160
let me fix that yeah so we have a very

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,679
nice

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,720
uh above we started off with a poll

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,320
among the 20 participants and asked them

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,160
do you know about rust have you read

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,039
about it in a blog or have you actually

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,559
ever written some rust well most people

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,039
just heard about it and wanted to know

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,520
more

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,080
so we started off with an introduction

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,160
about

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,600
what is rust what are the advantages how

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,240
does it work

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,120
and that was very nice maven and i

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,799
switched

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,799
in introducing various parts of the

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,000
language which we live coded

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,640
in a rust playground and then we got to

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,080
talking

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,880
how can we combine cute and rust

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,640
we demoed a couple of applications such

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,000
as a mill client

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,480
that i wrote in roster and qt and in the

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,600
last part

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,880
we talked about how kde can benefit

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,360
from rust so we came to the conclusion

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,520
that

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,480
c plus plus applications libraries

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,559
frameworks

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,200
they can actually use rust inside of

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,360
them but we shouldn't try to wrap kde

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,120
inside of rust crates so rust can really

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,320
be like a strong dependable

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,559
engine inside of our software

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,640
and maybe at some point we can also

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:42,080
publish pure rust code

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,200
but we shouldn't expect to put kde code

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,039
inside of rust

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,039
but the other way around the rest can go

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,919
inside of kde

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,919
applications a couple of suggestions

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,280
were to use rust for css

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,280
svg functionality where there are some

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,760
very nice libraries at the moment

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,559
or we could use it to make baloo more

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,360
stable and secure or kaio

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,919
those are two parts of kde that are

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,039
really nicely separated which could uh

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,320
yeah which

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,400
could be swapped out or maybe slowly

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,600
moved into a different programming

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,320
language

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,880
and we ended up by opening communication

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,679
channels

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,559
and we are still there now discussing uh

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,559
how to work on this

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,440
all right thanks girls i realize now

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,520
that i should have made a mutable joke

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,000
at the start of this um

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,240
moving on we have one buff session left

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,120
before this wrap-up is wrapped up

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,000
the kdev fundraising working group sat

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,039
down

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
with alesh alice is still at dinner

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,799
so someone else from the fundraising

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,320
group

00:21:48,799 --> 00:22:00,000
wants to say something about it no one

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
is jumping at the opportunity to talk

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,679
about the

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,679
fundraising working group

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,159
hey i i thought we were going to have

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,080
someone else join so yeah

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,600
we discussed and some of the problems

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,240
we've been having over the last year

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,880
in particular and trying to unify the

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,200
way that we

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,919
just communicate together so we're

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,840
moving

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,679
our main communication channel off of a

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,440
hybrid of a mailing list in the telegram

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,159
group to a slightly more free approach

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,960
which is

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
the same mailing list but zoomingless

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,600
and matrix

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,480
and we also discussed some plans around

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,440
our technology platforms and also our

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,080
messaging

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,840
so we're going to try to spend a bit and

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,880
get a better work into our long-term

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,280
messaging

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,159
we're also trying to um work on civic

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,080
crm

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,760
and we know seven crm has been a

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,960
long-running problem for the community

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,480
for quite some time

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,000
so this year is a year that we're really

00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,080
hoping to crack it

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,080
and then as always if anyone is um

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,520
watching us live or seeing the video or

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,559
is interested in joining fundraising

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,480
working group

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,200
and you're more than welcome please just

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,320
get in touch

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,320
all right thanks kenny

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,640
