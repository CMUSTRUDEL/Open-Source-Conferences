here it is

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,080
hey there i am mycroft i want to use

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,360
plasma on my big screen tv

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,679
how about at little voice apps here

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,400
at little traditional applications there

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,480
a bunch of kcms everywhere and we have

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,520
your plasmic screen experience ready for

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,279
use

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,720
now let's see one of my voice apps in

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,070
action

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,840
hey mycroft show me what's trending on

00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,840
[Music]

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
youtube

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,120
glad that works now how about browsing

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,879
the web

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,879
let's try that with a remote instead

00:00:50,160 --> 00:01:00,480
let's check out wikipedia

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,359
[Music]

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,359
some scroll down

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,239
some scroll up

00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,239
[Music]

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,360
and back to home

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,119
that was amazing let's now learn more

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,119
about plasma big screen from my team

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,119
okay how

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:40,440
i do get back to the presentation

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:43,510
or i do have to

00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,510
[Music]

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
okay i have to upload the presentation

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:55,840
again

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,840
i think so

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,349
so so so so i do

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,349
[Music]

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
applauded

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,959
okay here we are on the presentation

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,080
again

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,200
um uh

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,800
so uh you you just seen

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,920
um uh some feature of uh

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,040
plasma big screen so as you seen

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,760
is a big media center

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,760
which is a

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,000
which is meant to run on a tv

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,319
our reference hardware is a raspberry pi

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,319
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,959
and we use it as

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,959
connected with hdmi and

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,959
hdmi and uh

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,200
to the to the tv um with

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,080
a remote control connected to the

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,400
respect by

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,640
four when

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,640
you

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,200
when you are on a tv it's

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
very different than writing an

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,040
application for

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,319
the desktop because

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,799
there you have

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,799
only

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,560
only very few inputs so the input is

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,319
very different you don't have mouse and

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,319
keyboard you don't have touch you just

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,000
have a remote control with

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:59,519
a few uh direction keys uh

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,920
media keys and not much else recently

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,760
you

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,879
have voice as well and um

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,000
and we used also also voice support with

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,480
the minecraft

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,599
voice assistant and some integration

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,640
with it

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,479
uh and also the uh the output

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,320
is is very different it's a very big

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,759
screen but it's very far

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:26,320
uh so the information uh must must be

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,320
really not dense um

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,520
uh plasma big screen is written

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:37,440
mostly uh in qt and qml

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,800
so uh qml with regards to

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,840
keyboard navigation it's very tricky

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,560
but also very powerful

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,560
if you

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,360
if you follow some rules there are some

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,919
old keyboard navigation things that

00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,479
will be were inserted and

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,639
at the at the beginnings of the camera

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,840
life cycle which is better to not use

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,199
much

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:12,000
anymore like the keys.forward to

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:16,000
attached event but there are also

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,199
new things uh newer things that are

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,320
very useful like navigation which i will

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,320
talk a bit more

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,520
in detail later uh these is

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,360
uh uh our reference

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,560
um uh remote control uh

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,240
it's a pretty standard thing uh

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,919
they are pretty cheap they are seen

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,280
as a usb keyboard it has a little usb

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,160
dongle

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,880
so the arrow keys are seen as actual

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,880
arrow keys

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:57,280
and so on um that makes uh

00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:00,319
that makes really easy uh to

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,479
implement things um

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,880
that work with it it also has an

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,919
internal microphone

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,759
it's also seen as a usb sound card for

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,360
the microphone which is very

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,600
important uh it's very important for

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,600
uh

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,240
for the minecraft integration

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,680
some of them also have a kind of wiimote

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,319
gyroscope

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,120
kind of thing for controlling the mouse

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,280
but

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,880
we chosen to not to depend from that

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,400
in plasma big screen as it's at most

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,120
a uh a nice fallback

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,520
when there is some ui that it's not

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,120
really

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,800
up to par but we want to have a good

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,759
good ui so the workflow interaction

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,120
of plasma big screen is very simple you

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,599
turn on the tv

00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:02,639
you see a big full screen of um

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:05,120
of menu items

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,120
um

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,759
and then you choose what item to to

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,759
launch

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:20,080
and then you go back uh

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,759
i don't have much time left so i will

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,160
just go uh quickly over things

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,000
so we have some settings done with

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,520
system settings and kcm

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,800
which has been uh optimized

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,599
uh a lot for uh keyboard interaction

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
uh the primary user interface is done by

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,039
a plasma

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,160
a plasma shell using plasma nano which

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,080
is

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,080
mostly a kind of framework to build

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,879
shells on it but it's not a shell in

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,160
itself all you see it's a containment

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,960
uh the last thing i want to touch on

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,800
is the camera and key navigation as i as

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,080
i said

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,680
use the key navigation attached property

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,520
uh with it you can

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,720
you can specify

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,720
where the focus goes

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,960
when you press up down left right on

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,319
each control

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:27,360
so it's it's a very verbose

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:29,919
api but if well used uh

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
you can make key navigation go pretty

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,320
well

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,599
uh also focus scope um

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,800
it's uh it's a very good thing uh

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,519
as uh memorizes with the difference

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,720
between

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,200
uh focus and active focus where the

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,480
focus was in the last focal scope

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,440
unfortunately i don't have time to talk

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,600
more about it but i will happy to answer

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,959
any question about it now i will

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:09,839
leave the microphone to aditya

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:09,839
please take it away

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,839
hello oh

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,839
hope everyone can hear me

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,760
yeah hi everyone uh i'm alex here and

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,600
today i'm going to be talking about

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,880
voice applications and what's so special

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
about voice applications

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,160
so for one voice applications

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,880
aren't your traditional desktop

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,440
applications

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,720
they are basically python skills written

00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,240
in minecraft they don't draw

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,839
their own window python

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,240
voice applications have a qml user

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,519
interface

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,920
and basically

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,440
can provide a different user interface

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,160
for different type of devices without

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,399
having to rewrite her skill

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,320
voice applications can also be served

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,040
over the network

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,560
micro voice builds on being bundled with

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
the qml user interface

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,720
and a traditional desktop entry file is

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,839
actually what turns these vanilla

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,279
micro skills into voice applications

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,360
these voice applications are then

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,440
installable from online stores and gain

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,800
the ability to become launchable

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,920
via the big screen launcher to support

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:47,839
these operations micro gui application

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,839
provides a skill launching framework

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,920
so let's talk more about what is the

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,360
micro of gui and what are micro free

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
skills

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,200
micro skills are generally developed in

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,000
python and provide all the logical

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,560
functioning

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,640
of the voice application these skills

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,360
can then take advantage of the microsoft

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,040
skill class to perform operations such

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,839
as speaking dialogues

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,760
and sending data over to an enclosure

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,800
microphone closures can be of any type

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,519
of service

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,720
they can be a video service they can be

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,160
an audio service

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,839
or they can be an actually a physical

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,600
device that can

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,320
output data from a micro skill

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,440
minecraft gui is both a framework and an

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,880
application

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,680
powered by kirigami and cute the micro

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,720
gui

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,959
framework provides a skill view in which

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,120
these awesome voice applications display

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,600
their pages

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,720
it additionally also provides provides

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,440
an api

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,040
to talk to microsoft enclosure api that

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,000
serves as a data pipe

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,120
for skill events gui event triggers that

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,839
are accessible over

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,839
micros web socket message bus

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,240
so microscopy's awesome architecture

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,320
personal architecture for displaying

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,320
skill pages and data

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,639
can take advantage of qt's file

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,720
selectors to be able to deploy

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,000
the same voice application across

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,480
multiple platforms

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
with a dedicated user interface for each

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,079
platform

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,680
for example class optic screen which is

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,279
mainly designed to work with key

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,160
navigation

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,519
and usb remotes can use the media center

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,040
file selector

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,880
to display pages and serve qml files

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,160
that support key navigation

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,760
and tile based user interfaces one could

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,560
also use the android

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,519
file selector for a touch based

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,839
interface

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,839
for something like an android mobile

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,839
platform

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,480
let's look at some of the history of

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,240
packaging voice applications

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,480
so one of the early implementation

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,839
challenges we faced while working

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,279
on the voice application concept was

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,279
packaging micro skills are

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,720
traditionally lived inside an author's

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,200
get repository

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,920
which have been generally only installed

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,959
by

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,519
the skill command line interface using

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,440
repository links provided by authors

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,440
we wanted to make this process much

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,040
simpler by providing a graphical user

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,639
interface utility

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,440
and that's how the skill installer was

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,040
born one of the concepts was to have a

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,720
central location for listing all the

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,680
voice skills and applications without

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
actually searching

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,760
for github and forum links for

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,360
posting there are voice apps or voice

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,959
skills

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,480
it was then we figured that we could

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,079
actually utilize the awesome playing

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,199
store and the ocs api

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,199
to achieve this the micro skill

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,399
installer is a graphical front end to

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,959
micros own

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,519
skill manager command line utility it

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,440
provides

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,760
support for ocs enabled api stores

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,240
that can link their data to the skill

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,240
installer

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,600
authors can add voice applications by

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,920
listing them under the minecraft apps

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,600
category on the playing store

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,040
voice applications listed in the playing

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,399
store by the authors

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,519
then provide the graphical user

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,360
interface still meta information

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,639
like which branch the installer should

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,480
use or

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,320
if the voice applications need any

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,519
specific system dependencies

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,880
installed to work correctly this creates

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,639
a much cleaner installation and

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,199
distribution experience for both the

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,880
users

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,519
and voice application voice skill

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
developers

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,160
moving on let's talk about skills with

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,079
the home page

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,920
home pages provide that traditional

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,920
application experience when using

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,920
non-voice input methods

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,600
to voice applications home pages are

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,839
like an entry point to the voice

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,560
application they provide a central

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,560
interface

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,120
for controlling the voice application

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,639
either via key integrated key navigation

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,560
or via voice navigation home pages

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,720
are also required to tell the skill

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,160
desktop entry file which skill pages

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,320
should be displayed

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,959
when opening a voice application from

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,959
the launcher

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,480
so voice applications are really easy to

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,040
get started with

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,399
with all one needs is a basic idea of

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,360
what they would like

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,880
the application to do this can be as

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,440
complex as interacting with video

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,519
service library apis online

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,480
displaying hundreds of playable movies

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
that can be made

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,759
interactive through a conversational

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,320
style voice interface

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,360
or can be a simple displaying images

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,959
gallery

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,480
or speaking quotes from some website

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,480
one can refer to the detailed

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,160
documentation with examples for plasma

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,000
big screen website

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,839
and minecraft's own documentation site

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,880
to read about developing your first gui

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,279
enable

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,040
voice application using the micro gui

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,720
framework

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,320
micro gui framework also provides a

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,959
bunch of templates to help you get

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,040
started

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,120
with making simple skills and the

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,680
freedom of qml is not only limited to

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,399
these

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,880
templates the power to explore what

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,519
works applications can be made to do

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,320
is only limited to one's own creativity

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,399
and plasma

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,120
big screen users would surely be glad to

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,199
have more of them

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,120
feel free to drop into plasma big screen

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,759
telegram channel for more updates

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,279
discussions or any help regarding voice

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,680
applications

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,680
thank you very good for questions

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:56,480
uh doesn't seems uh to be

00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
uh questions not yet um

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:04,959
so we can uh fill up a bit

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,280
the time by going a bit more in details

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,240
yeah sure you can you still have seven

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,120
minutes

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,520
yeah but but but please uh feel free to

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,559
do

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,199
any question uh about um yes

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,959
everyone if you have questions please

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,559
share it in the shared notes so i can

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,799
let them know

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,839
okay uh people attendees are asking for

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,880
some demo

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,360
is that possible at the moment uh

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,160
i don't think at the moment aditya do

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,679
you have

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,480
something set up not really not right

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,400
now

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,440
okay so today

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,799
so the the nearest uh the nearest

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,080
to a demo right now i think is the

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,360
is the video that we posted in

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:55,280
at the beginning which i

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,640
am posting a url

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,720
now in the chat um

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,160
so uh that's um uh that video has

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,120
actual um uh

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,559
actual uh screens and actual interaction

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,080
of uh

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,160
plasma big screen uh the

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,200
kind of a bit robotized voice there

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,919
there is uh

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,440
in the uh in the foreground is the

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,039
actual voice

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,720
uh of minecraft uh that has just been

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:31,200
uh modified to actually

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,160
and to to speak a description of the

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,039
video

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,679
but it is the voice that you will hear

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,799
when you

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,799
interact with it uh

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,080
in the minecraft setup there are a

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,000
couple of

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,799
three or four different voices that you

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,799
can choose from

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:55,120
so yeah in the in

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,880
in in the end we chose to do a very

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:02,400
a very simple and basic thing for now uh

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,760
partly also because uh we think

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,799
that experience of watching a tv is not

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,559
much

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,520
using the chrome that there is around

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,559
but it's actually watching the stuff so

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,559
um i'm so sorry mark would interrupt you

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,919
but we have a few questions

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,080
okay perfect uh the first question is

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,600
what's the base system and how do i

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,360
install it on a fight four

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,720
okay so we have now

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,600
an image on uh

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,600
based on neon

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,600
and uh i will post

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,120
later in the chat a link to the

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:51,200
2d image so uh installing it

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,200
on the pi4 it's quite easy

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,200
you download the image you flash it on a

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,960
microsd

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:02,159
and as it's usual with raspberry pi

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,360
uh you just you just put the

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:08,960
microsd in the raspberry pi

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,880
and boot it and it's okay a very

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,559
later version of the raspberry pi can

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,640
also boot from usb

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,480
you would have to make some manual

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,799
modification on the image for doing that

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,360
but

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,919
it's kind of supported as well

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,720
okay our next question we just have

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,600
three minutes

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,919
uh so it will be quick any idea how far

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,480
the integration on post

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:37,520
market market os is the big screen

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,640
okay so i can check that uh so uh from

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,679
what i know there are

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,960
a few packages on post market awares who

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,200
are trying to package

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,360
big screen and microsoft for post market

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,720
os

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,120
okay great uh

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,200
the other question is is there a python

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,120
wrapper for the ocs

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,120
playing store api

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,840
uh so yes uh i think there is a

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,720
python wrapper but uh we don't use the

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,679
python wrapper

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,679
we use the cute stuff directly

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,440
okay great uh so the last question

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,159
uh which applications are supported for

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,679
big screen

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,240
cute only gtk do they need to be

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,600
optimized for remote control

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,080
okay so uh basically

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,600
the the the thing is on the last

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,720
question do they need to be optimized

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,240
for remote control

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,200
is yes uh so

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,320
any application that works decently with

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,120
the remote control

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,559
and it's at the moment packaged on neon

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,880
or

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:51,840
packaged on postmaster post marketplace

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,559
that is supported but if on one end you

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,000
could you could really launch the gym

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,039
at the on on on there but you

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,320
wouldn't

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,600
do much with it in the end uh

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,480
so if an application is gtk or if it has

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,080
a

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,200
a private um

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,600
private toolkit it's it's okay as long

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,039
as they they work nicely with the remote

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,200
control

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,240
you can you can for instance you can

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,720
just

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,919
install kodi alongside and launch code

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,280
as an application that's

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,799
perfectly supported

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,840
but but yeah just just anything goes

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,600
as long as uh works well with the remote

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,159
control

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,080
okay thank you thank you so much marco

and i'm here to talk about free software

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,120
first fader

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,120
and kde

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,720
first i will introduce myself uh

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,440
i'm basically working as a full stack

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,520
web developer and i'm also a programmer

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,960
i work at a company called alpha fog

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,440
technologies

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,320
it's located in a small state of

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,320
caroline india

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,960
i'm also a member of the software

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,720
community of india

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,360
you can come there fsci to prime

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,880
software in france

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:40,960
we provide pricier setting

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,520
services so we promote free software in

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,840
india

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,399
coordinating various researcher

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,399
communities

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,480
so the main topic of my topic uh is

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,919
about a newspaper in kerala it's called

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,559
janugam we speak a language called

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,679
malayalam

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,679
in the state of kerala

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,799
it's that even paper it's owned by cpa

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:12,640
carelessly committed to

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:16,159
a political party

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:26,480
it has almost about 100k readers

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:28,320
and it is founded in 1947

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,559
so talking about the background of the

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,640
story uh

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,000
it started with the general papers

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,039
decision

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,039
to migrate to a

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,159
new rear branch technology stack

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,240
the main reason for this is because of

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,039
their increasing cost of

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,120
proprietary software they weren't able

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,440
to

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,640
continue their work so they were looking

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,640
for alternative solutions

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,240
there were also other reasons such as

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,279
friendly government policies

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,279
it was interrupting their

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:13,039
industry as you can see in 2019

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,200
reporters without borders has ranked

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,039
india 140 out of 180 countries in the

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,799
press freedom index

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,399
actually it's very pathetic situation

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,480
the newspaper and other

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,480
media trying hard to survive

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,360
so the first session of general was to

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,960
switch to adobe indesign

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,399
they already used startup page maker

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,480
before

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,080
but as i said uh the increasing cost

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,120
prevented them

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,039
so checking for alternatives

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,159
they ended up with a free software

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,159
artist called

00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:00,000
praveen admiratory who suggested them to

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,440
use scribus

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,440
and that's how they came to meet us

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,039
as you can see in the photo this is the

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:19,440
generation

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:21,519
free software project migration team

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,559
this is the old software stack they used

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,840
it consisted of microsoft windows

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,399
um an ascii 2

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,200
unicode converter tool called type it

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,880
which only works on windows

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,880
they also have other add-on tools such

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,880
as page maker and photoshop

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:51,519
um so what we decide what we

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,960
suggested them is to use free software

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,000
instead

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,720
of course including drivers

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
instead of just switching only the

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,760
typesetting software

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,600
we also suggested them to change the in

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,279
their stack including operating system

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:15,200
and the primary choice of

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:17,600
kde based ubuntu or kubundu

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,760
we said that we could develop a custom

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:24,080
distro for them

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,080
based on this kubuntu um

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,440
which was open to 19.04

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:34,320
consisting plasma desktop subscribers

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,120
and we added a software called general

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,120
made it

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
previously i mentioned type type it

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,840
right

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,840
so as an alternative for it to working

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,360
new linux we developed our own

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,600
from scratch a

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,559
ask you to unicode converter and it's

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,279
called janago made it

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,840
and we also added dim and escape to the

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,840
stack

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,399
and these are the other softwares it

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,919
includes kate

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,480
killer firefox libreoffice playing for

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,919
kuru

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,000
actually they were very happy with the

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,640
new software stack which they have been

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,640
introduced to

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,840
so let me get a little bit back more to

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,919
the story

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,399
this is kh hussein from kerala

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,640
he used to design various custom unicode

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,240
phones

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,320
so in this project his role was to

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,080
design three different

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,760
unicode phones for general

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,720
till then they only use this last key

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,240
which was in you know adult page maker

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,240
which didn't support unicode

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,600
this case hussein we call him hussein

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,120
master

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,120
along with our shogun master it was them

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,919
who

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,320
contacted us regarding this migration

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,320
project

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,200
as the adobe design wasn't affordable uh

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,159
they consulted

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,960
master first and that's okumar he's also

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,639
from kerala

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,079
who has more than four decades of

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,079
expertise in that of type setting

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,119
so they came to know about tribes from

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,800
praveen and they contacted us

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,280
like i said before we suggested them

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,879
subscribers and uh

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,879
ecuador is the software stack

00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,000
um our team also consists of

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,159
these members as you can see in the

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,760
picture right now uh

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,919
talking from left most it is kanan

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,200
right next to him with her own bag she's

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,000
called sharonya

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,040
and the one behind her is ranjit city

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,560
and next to him

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,680
is ashokan master and the one in the

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,520
center with white

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:06,240
white shatties rajaji and we have

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,760
mujeeb me and jose master on the photo

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,640
this is the core team

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,119
who worked behind this migration project

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,920
uh

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,839
khan man ranjit cg muji and embody we

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,839
were together in alpha four technologies

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,520
as i said the migration also included

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,480
migration from ascii to

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,520
unicode as well three different phones

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,599
were developed

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,599
called tnj are super then

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,359
which consists of you know

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,240
exclusive character set in malayalam

00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,079
unlike in

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,079
ascii which didn't have that option

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,440
coming to the

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,800
the main reason is to be fine it's a

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,960
familiar ui

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,400
you know windows people really find it

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,320
easy to use

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,200
kd it's very user friendly and it also

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,240
provides

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,000
a lot of customization features and

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,359
scribers the main software they use for

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,440
type setting it is in qt

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:26,480
and kde integrates well with qt

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,400
the custom ascii unicode software we

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,760
developed it also works in

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,760
reverse circuit qt

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:41,839
and kd provides plasma widgets which is

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,839
another cool feature

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,480
so what we customized a lot

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,320
is regarding around the plasma theme we

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,320
customized it to make it unique

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,160
to give the branding for generation

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,040
the boot animation from boot animation

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,119
to a wallpaper and

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,079
you know and their team reaching their

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,720
lock

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,200
to match the branding of the newcom and

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,079
they were very happy with it

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,839
the plasma splash screen sdm login team

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,960
icon team

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:19,920
custom menu item team we almost

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,920
redesigned and there

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,119
look and feel to make it look more

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,119
unique to them

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,440
and one of the cool features they like

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,760
most is

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,520
dolphin dolphin features as you know

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,440
it was entirely new to them to

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,280
experience the table browsing in a file

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,560
manager

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:52,000
on one side we showed a demo with a

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,520
firefox and they compared it to

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,839
a dolphin sharing the tab table browsing

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,599
free

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,200
feature and all with the same shortcuts

00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,440
you know ctrl t to open a new tab

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,839
control w to close it ctrl shift d open

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,000
so recently closely tab

00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:09,680
they were very happy with it and the

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,960
split view was really helpful to them

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,720
you know working with the two different

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,280
directories at a time switching is very

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,520
easy with the split view

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,839
and the file preview even text files can

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,839
be previewed

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,240
they work with the text files most so

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,880
you know the content for newspaper it is

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,240
easy to

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,880
preview before opening it as well

00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,599
and a couple of additional features we

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,960
added

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,960
is service menus

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,920
for example to edit images and pdf files

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,839
via extra service menus to make it very

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,079
easy for them

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,480
and the network options with the dolphin

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,480
to access remote files that is also very

00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:03,200
handy

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,280
this is a public announcement photo

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,040
before explaining about that let me

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,079
say a little more about this background

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,839
story of scribers

00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,280
many of many of you may have been

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,720
already

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,960
familiar with it drivers is a

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,680
cross-platform free and open source

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:23,280
software for desktop publishing

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,560
usually means

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,320
before some time it didn't support

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,760
many languages such as malayalam we use

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,520
here

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:37,839
uh there was a project called host a man

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,359
uh headed by alfajadal who introduced

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,280
non-latin language support with a you

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,280
know homeless tesla to inscribe us that

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,240
really helped us a lot

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,040
because only after that we were we were

00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,520
able to use

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,640
malayalam inscribers without that this

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,960
whole project would have

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,560
been even possible so i would like to

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,440
thank mr fire the

00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,960
father and for their valuable

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,359
contribution subscribers actually that

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:11,839
is the beauty of free software you know

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:14,720
people can add features missing

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,520
and in the project we took almost one

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,560
month to complete the training session

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,880
for about 100 staff

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:28,960
it was hands-on session

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,200
we took it in uh three batches uh

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,319
everyone went fine because they were

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
already familiar with the textual

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,040
publishing

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,520
system so it wasn't very hard to train

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,520
them the only issue is with the

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,880
changing look and feel but as i said the

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,319
kde made it

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,319
the transition very easy

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,079
apart from just giving training

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,560
regarding the

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,920
you know software stack we already we

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,359
also introduced them the philosophy of

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,800
free software

00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,599
uh and we even recommended to upload the

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,400
images and

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,599
you know contribute to wikipedia with

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,960
you media comments and

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,280
or sorry

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,720
uh staff were very friendly and they

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,720
cooperated with us

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,000
with us and they were very enthusiastic

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,760
about planning

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,359
all this you know we

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,680
talked about creative commons license

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,680
and all

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,839
we also gave some training in uh basic

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,839
you know this draw

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,599
how to interact with the desktop

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,400
environment

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,400
ending escape

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,480
there were some couple of issues

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,480
regarding hardware and all because

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,040
you know not all for we don't have free

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,480
software drivers for our

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,040
hardware out there you know so we had

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,040
some issues

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,599
some of them we solved by taking many

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,359
online forums and all

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:09,040
but some we couldn't fix and we

00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:17,839
suggested them to buy new software

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:17,839
excuse me

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,800
so after everyone got trained in using

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:34,880
scribers

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,440
we went for a pilot period of one month

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,440
where they slowly transitioned page by

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,800
page

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,319
each week so it was actually a

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,359
combination of tribes and

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,359
adobe for some time

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,880
once they were confident enough to

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,880
switch completely to crybus

00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:01,040
we run for another week and it is on

00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,040
november 1st the official announcement

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:06,640
was done and it was by

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,920
chief minister of kerala mr pinner ivy

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,440
james as you can see in the photo

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,119
he announced the migration to free

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,119
software stack and unicode event

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:28,160
and we didn't support

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,119
you know proprietary platforms whether

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,640
it be social media or even for personal

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,920
you said so what we did instead

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,920
for promoting the event

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,040
was to share the post across the free

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,240
software

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,520
based social media platforms such as

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,440
you know diaspora and mastodon

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,200
we didn't even have a twitter account

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,560
you know

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:59,920
um actually it is the master dice for a

00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,920
post that you can see here

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,079
and we also share the content in

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:12,319
mastodon so from mastertown

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,160
uh for the post really picked up by

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:17,280

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,839
very happy with it

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,839
that's how we got real exposure you know

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,880
we got also featured on hacker news and

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:37,839
what made me happy more is officially

00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,839
shared the story

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,000
this is the general stop after the first

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,280
training batch

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,720
after the training session and all

00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,000

people from different industries uh

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:09,280
first industry

00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,160
uh mainly to discuss about the future of

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,160
this project

00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:16,319
uh many were very really interested

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,839
even kerala government offered support

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,839
to continue with this project

00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,160
it is a kerala media academy for

00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:33,040
organization

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,640
who before the leader of custerman

00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,440
project and

00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,040
one of the core developers of hosterman

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,720
support needed

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,960
for the development inscribers and this

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,960
um

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,160
there was also another subscribers

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,480
developer whom i should mention here his

00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,000
name is hilary moldy

00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,520
one experience i would like to share is

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:06,000
as soon as we filed a bug report

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:08,000
we got a patch to fix it

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,200
overnight you know all night patch we

00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
were

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:16,640
able to fix the victor bug

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,040
uh the summit also became the venue for

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,760
the formation of a

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,760
consortium

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,480
with the above mentioned

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,040
representatives and their i.t experts to

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,359
promote self-reliance in publishing

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,720
the consortium also promised to raise

00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,720
funds for further developments

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,560
and we really wish we can implement this

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,560
in various other

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,520
newspaper and so that you know free

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,560
software

00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,560
we can expect many

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,520
any free software based in newspapers

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:11,040
so that's the story of geneva

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,599
we hope this inspired many newspaper to

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,079
come from

00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,720
come forward to switch to free software

00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:24,480
and

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:26,720
we will be always happy to help

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,720
so

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:38,160
the one receiving the presentation in

00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:41,280
this photo this is mr fahad

00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:44,240
so i hope my time is over

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,800
the remaining session is left for

00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,760
personal answer

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,400
hi everybody that was a great firing

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,640
talk

00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,800
i would really like to mention this to

00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,680
the audience that he was so not well but

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,079
he still gave

00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,839
a great job so applause for that great

00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,520
work

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:03,440
we have a few questions which i'll be

00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,559
reading out

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,000
sure the first question is does stocks

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:12,240
seem to be focusing more on dtp aspect

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,079
do you have online service integration

00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:18,160
such as google amp

00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:20,559
or news aggregator services

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,480
sorry no currently there is no online

00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,400
integration but

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,240
we are also we are also working on a

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,800
project called a new flow

00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,720
management software it will have this

00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,119
cloud integration feature and all but uh

00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,319
we are not planning to integrate google

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,400
imp

00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,920
we won't you would like to keep it uh

00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,760
free software

00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,599
only okay another question

00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,839
would you mind sharing the action

00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,960
scripts they could be handy even for

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,720
blogging

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,880
uh actually we haven't developed any

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,920
action scripts yet

00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,599
we host our and there uh you know we

00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,800
haven't

00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,800
even tried the full

00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:07,040
you know the software and as i said uh

00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,359
the distro was based on kubundu

00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,559
uh but we haven't uh shared the rapport

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:14,079
with uh

00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:18,480
you know virtual uh

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:22,160
code to build the display instead uh

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,280
we shared the uh whatever we customized

00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,880
in airport so that

00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:30,480
one can follow it and customize it as

00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,319
they like because even if you share

00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,160
you know it contains the branding of

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,599
general mandal there is no issue with

00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,440
sharing

00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,960
the only issues you will have to remove

00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,839
branding from it so

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,839
we just said the

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,960
tutorial to build the cust custom distro

00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,720
as they like with all the customizations

00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,599
which have made it is documented it is

00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,119
available in

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:56,079
git dot for community without a a custom

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,720
github sorry custom git lab instance

00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,839
hosted by

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,640
free software community of india back to

00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,400
the question

00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,599
sorry that we don't have any action

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,599
scripts to share now

00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,000
okay fine the last question any hard

00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,920
challenges you faced during this

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,119
project uh yes actually

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,119
the first challenge was to

00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,119
make the staff confident that they can

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,440
switch to a new software a new software

00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,680
stack because everyone was

00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,440
you know familiar with the software

00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,800
which they have been using for almost

00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,240
uh 10 to 15 years you know it is really

00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,920
hard for them to sustain your

00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:40,640
software stack one day so

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,839
so preparing the staff to work with the

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,559
new software psych was the main

00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:46,319
challenge

00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,559
and after we were able to show a demo

00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:51,520
they were really

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,280
you know started to gain confidence and

00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,559
it was

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,280
relatively easy for them to

00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,119
migrate and some other challenges we

00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,160
faced was regarding

00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,000
the hardware support for you know

00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,800
many hardware doesn't support free

00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,800
software drivers and all

00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:15,200
so some printers gave us some

00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,200
issues

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:23,440
and apart from that

00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,440
everything went find uh

00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,880
and there is also issue with uh you know

00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,240
scribers is not yet

00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:33,200
fully uh you know we can compare it with

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,200
our dog in design

00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:37,440
it still needs a lot of development and

00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,559
we are working on that we

00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,240
have a matrix room with the scribus

00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,079
developers we are discussing the changes

00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:49,200
we need and they are very friendly

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,200
and i hope it will become

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:19,839
and then our next speaker will be there

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:19,839

01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:30,240

hi everyone thank you for joining the

01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,920
talk

01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,799
so this year we're still celebrating the

01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,480
20 years of

01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:40,799
g-compre so i will

01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,720
explain you what we've been working on

01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:46,480
and what to expect this year

01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,480
and what so let's start

01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,200
for those who don't know gcm3 is a

01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,400
educational

01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,839
sweet for children from two to ten with

01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,119
it you can

01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:02,000
well children can learn not everything

01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,440
but almost

01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,160
like from learning how to use a keyboard

01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,000
and miles

01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:13,359
but also reading writing

01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,760
mathematics physics all kinds of science

01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:16,960
and

01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:20,000
discover a lot of different things

01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:23,839
and it's used in primary schools all

01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:26,960
over the world we've seen it used in

01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:30,400
schools in france in germany spain

01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:33,760
india brazil and so on

01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,760
we also saw it deployed by associations

01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,880
in

01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:42,240
poor remote villages in africa

01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:47,039
in asia and other places

01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:51,200
so it i we don't do anything to track

01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:53,280
the user so i cannot tell exactly the

01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,200
number of users we have but from the few

01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,000
metrics i have i

01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:00,319
can say for sure we can count it as

01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,799
million a few million users

01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:09,039
for sure

01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:12,240
this year started the change started in

01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:14,240
february february

01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,039
i decided to make the full version

01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:20,640
binaries of the company completely

01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:23,680
free of cost for all platforms it was a

01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:26,799
change i had in mind for a lot of time i

01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:32,799
wanted to do that change but

01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:35,520
it was a big jump to do so

01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:36,480
in the beginning of the year i as i saw

01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,039
the

01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,520
situation starting to get bad with the

01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:44,880
coronavirus i

01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,200
so anticipated that it would be very

01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,319
good

01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:51,359
time to give this tool for

01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:54,640
every child in the world who

01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:54,640
can learn at home so

01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:01,520
yeah this was

01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:03,359
one day i wake up and say okay today

01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:06,000
let's do the switch and i discussed with

01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:14,880
johnny the other co-maintainer and

01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:19,039
within one two days it was done

01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:22,720
so but then the question was

01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:25,920
by making it at no cost how could i keep

01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:29,839
working and found my work on it so i

01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,839
decided to go back on patreon

01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,520
i already had a patreon page that i

01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,520
started when i

01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,839
started to work on the graphics project

01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,400
country in 2015 but

01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:43,039
because it didn't work good i left it

01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,000
alone and

01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:47,200
abandoned it a bit but it was good time

01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:52,160
to try again

01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:54,880
and hopefully it does work

01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:56,480
good enough for now we don't have i

01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,520
don't have yet that many

01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,839
patrons but hopefully

01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,119
there's a one company who deploys

01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:05,920
jcomphree on

01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,799
pre-installed on hardware and they

01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:12,000
agreed to

01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:16,319
support me on patreon so it helps to

01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,480
for now keep the same amount of work

01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:24,799
the same amount of time i can dedicate

01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:27,679
for that work

01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:28,880
and then there was the lockdown effect

01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,560
in march when

01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,080
the lockdown was starting to be

01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,679
effective everywhere

01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:37,839
almost in the world we could see a

01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,400
lot of blog posts from teachers all

01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:43,120
around recommending

01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:45,679
to parents to use decompre at home for

01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:48,480
homeschooling for the kids

01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:50,400
we even have some mails from teachers

01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,719
who previously bought the full version

01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,520
and

01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:55,199
they were asking if they didn't see the

01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,279
news that we made it free and they were

01:08:55,199 --> 01:09:00,560
asking if we could

01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:03,920
allow somehow the their

01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,600
pupils to use it at home and we say yeah

01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,600
that's already done they can download

01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,799
the full version now and

01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,920
yeah let them enjoy it we also

01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:18,319
saw lots of youtube videos posted

01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:21,040
uh by different random people who

01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:24,400
wanted to show gcompre as a good

01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:26,880
alternative for homeschooling

01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,480
you can just searching on youtube and

01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:32,159
you will find lots of

01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:32,159
funny and interesting results

01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:41,279
yeah so what to expect

01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:42,880
uh very soon next release will finally

01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:47,839
be the 1.0

01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:51,920
release that was weighted by many people

01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:54,640
1.0 because we restarted as you know the

01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:57,199
rewrote the project from scratch which

01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:00,840
started in 2014 and since then

01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:02,000
it took some time to import all the

01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,400
activities

01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
we don't have yet all the activities

01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,719
from the

01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,840
old version but we actually have more

01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,159
activities

01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,679
in number and we have the most important

01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:16,560
ones

01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:18,080
we had we wanted to achieve a few

01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:22,000
milestones before

01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,000
doing that 1.0 release but

01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:26,719
we don't have all of them yet but we

01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:29,920
have enough changes

01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:31,679
significant changes to decide to make it

01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,640
this year and well

01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,120
for the 20 years it was also a good time

01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:39,760
to celebrate

01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:42,719
so far the improvement that we'll have

01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,719
in the next release

01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,440
i will say after but the release

01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:51,360
planning

01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,360
we want to do string freeze in

01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,159
about a week so for september 14th we

01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,800
plan to do the string freeze

01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,440
and i will provide better packages for

01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,000
the

01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,520
translators to test their or to check

01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,840
the context

01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:10,719
and we will do string freeze for

01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,480
we think two months which is a bit big

01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:15,440
but

01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:17,040
we have a lot of new strings to work on

01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:21,440
and we also

01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:24,880
i did review all the existing strings

01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,560
recently so a lot of

01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:30,480
translators will find lots of fuzzy

01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,480
strings they will have to adapt or

01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,800
that time retransl also it would be also

01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,120
a good time for

01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,640
everyone who want to provide the missing

01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,880
voices for the

01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:52,719
language so if you

01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,239
your language is me still missing some

01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:57,360
voices and

01:11:54,239 --> 01:12:01,440
and you feel like recording your voice

01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,440
you're welcome to contribute please do

01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:12,320
also just before the string freeze if

01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:15,760
some native english speakers

01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,880
want to make a another round of review

01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,800
on the strings

01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,480
you're welcome there's still one week

01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:26,080
for that

01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:28,080
so the main big big feature for

01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,080
next release will be the multiple data

01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:33,360
sets i already talked about it in

01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:35,679
uh previous talk it's been a long

01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,719
ongoing effort we started more than a

01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:40,480
year ago

01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:44,159
almost two years ago and the feature

01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,960
is to allow to split the content of an

01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:48,560
activity

01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:50,960
into several parts of different

01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,480
difficulty levels to make the activities

01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:56,640
more modular

01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:59,760
and more accessible for different ages

01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:01,520
i will explain how it works so here's

01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,040
the main menu of gcom3

01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,719
before we had just this tool icon for

01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,760
the main configuration

01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:12,719
and we had the same icon in

01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,560
some activities for their activity

01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,520
configuration

01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,320
now we have this new icon purple with

01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,360
three lines

01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,719
which is for the activity settings it

01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:26,159
contains both

01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:33,840
the activity options but also the

01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:33,840
multiple dataset options for

01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,840
oh

01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:17,360
is it better now worse is better

01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:20,640
good yeah so good i'll

01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:23,760
continue so in the main menu

01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:26,560
what i was saying the we have a

01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,080
star icons on each activity to represent

01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,159
its difficulty level

01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,679
but now with multiple data sets some

01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:35,120
activities can have

01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,840
two icons one the first one showing the

01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,040
minimum

01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,480
difficulty of the activated data set

01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,640
and the second one the maximum

01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,880
difficulty so you can have an idea of

01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:49,760
the range

01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,760
so when clicking on an activity settings

01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:56,800
you will find this menu

01:14:53,280 --> 01:15:00,159
with the dataset panel option

01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:03,199
open by default showing the

01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:06,320
available data set that you can enable

01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:08,640
or disable by clicking on the respective

01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,640
icon

01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,520
and there's a

01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,640
second tab with the options if there are

01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,920
some options

01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,960
and you can click cancel to just

01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,800
close without saving your changes save

01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,600
to save your changes and go back to the

01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,679
menu

01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,800
or save and start to save your changes

01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,800
and start the activity

01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,040
here you started the activity and you

01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,440
find again the same

01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,800
activity settings icon inside the

01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,360
activity

01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,280
if you click on it from the activity

01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,159
then it will open

01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,280
directly in the options tab not the data

01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:48,239
set one

01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,199
because usually we expect users to want

01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:51,440
to

01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:52,800
set up the data set before starting the

01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,640
activity

01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,400
and changing the options is more

01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,840
something they would change

01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:01,840
while using the activity typically

01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,840
so here you can just close without

01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:07,600
saving or save and return to the

01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:09,840
activity

01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,679
another change that was needed to

01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,880
implement the multiple data set

01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:16,400
feature in the main configuration of the

01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:20,000
software there's this

01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:23,760
difficulty filter option

01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:27,040
it was used to filter activities

01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:30,080
according to the level of difficulty but

01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:32,840
now it also filters that asset so

01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:34,400
if for example i select one and two star

01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:37,520
difficulty

01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:42,480
it will filter activities which has no

01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:42,480
content for this level

01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:47,760
and it will also automatically filter

01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:50,320
the data sets

01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,000
and enable the corresponding ones so now

01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,000
you see numbers with dice that's only

01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,640
one and two stars well before it has

01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,320
it has one and three and if you go in

01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,840
the menu

01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:03,840
you see all those other datasets are

01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,840
hidden

01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,040
we also have new activities for the next

01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:13,679
release the first one is

01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,320
gravity this one i decided to work on

01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,280
because

01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:20,159
i wanted to replace an existing activity

01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:23,360
we had called intro gravity

01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:26,400
which had several issues which was

01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,719
not really fixable the main issue is

01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,719
that

01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,159
the concept of the activity was to

01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:33,520
change the size of the planet

01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:36,400
to move a spaceship which

01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,880
by itself is a bit weird concept and it

01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,560
was

01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:44,320
very hard to use and it did not

01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:46,640
scale at all to phone screens so

01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:48,719
i scrapped it and restarted the

01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:51,040
different one from scratch

01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:53,520
for gravity in this one it's more simple

01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:56,640
and easy to use without just

01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,280
random planets in both sides of the

01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,480
screen

01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:03,120
going up down and you have to move the

01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:05,440
spaceship and it will be attracted to

01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,719
the planet according to gravity force

01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,280
and the arrows

01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:11,199
on the top the lengths change depending

01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,440
on the gravity

01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:14,400
so it's more easy and fun to use than

01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:17,360
the previous one

01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:19,280
and it gives good sense of gravity for

01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:21,679
the kids

01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,960
the next new activity is baby keyboard

01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,840
this one was

01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,920
requested by a user who wanted something

01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:31,440
very simple for his baby to

01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,440
get started using a keyboard

01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:38,400
now it's the simplest activity possible

01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,120
just type any key on the keyboard and it

01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,640
will

01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:44,000
type the corresponding character and

01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,000
play the voice if there's one

01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:50,560
the next activity is learn digits this

01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:55,440
one was requested by

01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:58,560
emmanuel one of our contributors he

01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:00,000
it's based on an exercise this

01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,400
contributor is a teacher

01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,719
for primary school so it's based on an

01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:07,840
exercise he's using

01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,480
in his school to teach digits so we

01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,840
display

01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,880
a number here we play the voice and the

01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,320
kid has to

01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:20,480
just keep the number of dots and

01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:22,400
press ok to validate the answer and

01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:24,239
there's also options to instead of

01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:28,000
display digit display some

01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:30,880
dots or display hand to count

01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,080
to learn the value of each number and

01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,080
associate it with the voice

01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,560
next new activities are learn addition

01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:41,679
and learn subscription which are

01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,159
derivative of learner digits it's the

01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,800
same

01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:47,199
but just we show a simple addition of

01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,760
subtraction to

01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:51,840
just to learn the concept of those

01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:54,960
operations

01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,440
and i kept the best for the end the new

01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,480
last new activity is analog electricity

01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:02,400
which was the most

01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:04,239
uh missing one we had from the old

01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,560
version of j-concrete that was not

01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:08,719
ported yet and now we have it thanks to

01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,040
my wife aishwarya who

01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,239
decided to work on it this summer since

01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:15,520
she has a

01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:16,400
electronics degree electronics engineer

01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,520
degree and she

01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:21,520
wants to work on software development

01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,239
now it was a good exercise to practice

01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:25,440
our skills

01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:27,280
so we have a feature parity

01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,199
exact picture priority with the old

01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:31,679
activity with first level

01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:33,520
with those three components battery

01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,320
build and switch

01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,639
a second level with a bit more

01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:41,120
components like real start

01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,000
another kind of switch three point

01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:46,320
switch

01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:49,600
and the connection point and

01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:52,800
third level with again more components

01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:55,440
like resistor red lead

01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,440
and yeah we have same features but we

01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,400
also have a few improvements compared to

01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:02,159
the old version

01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:04,560
like you can see all the wires

01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:06,000
share the same color if they share the

01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,639
same connection point

01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:15,679
which helps to understand the circuit

01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:18,960
how it works

01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:22,239
now another improvement

01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:25,679
is that we have

01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:27,520
we can rotate components we can

01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:28,960
zoom in zoom out and turn the canvas

01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:32,000
these features we

01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:35,520
come from the digital electricity

01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,719
activity we had which we can we could

01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,560
copy some of the code but

01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:42,960
it was not modular enough we can reuse

01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:45,120
it we have to have copy

01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,840
another good improvement is we have the

01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,840
information

01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,239
of each component if you click on the

01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:55,520
component and click on the information

01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:57,360
icon you will have text explaining

01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,120
what this component does and how it's

01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,760
used

01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,880
and another improvement is if you do a

01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:06,000
very weird circuit

01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,840
which should not work or is called

01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,920
illegal as it's called in the

01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,760
engine we're using well then we will

01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,800
display a warning message

01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,679
explaining that it has a voltage loop or

01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,400
source shorted by wire and then that you

01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,719
should

01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:24,880
fix your circuit to make the simulation

01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:27,520
work good

01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:29,280
and of course the belt will break if

01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:33,040
there's too much current in it

01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:34,960
and same for the red lead

01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:38,080
if you use it without a resistor you

01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:40,080
have that surprise

01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:42,080
the next improvement is keyboard support

01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:45,360
we fixed all the focus issues

01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:48,639
and we added the

01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,639
new keyboard controls

01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,719
and i added new videos for several

01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:56,159
activities

01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:57,440
and made layout improvements again for

01:22:56,159 --> 01:23:00,800
several activities

01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:04,000
and made countless bug faces

01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:06,000
bug fixes and usability improvements all

01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,199
around so

01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
that's it thank you i want to thank

01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:12,159
everyone

01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,520
all the contributors all my patrons

01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:16,400
supporting my work

01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:18,800
and yeah if you have any questions i'm

01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:22,239
not sure we'll have time but

01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:24,719
let's see yeah i'm so sorry about that

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:26,080
we are out of time so you're quite

01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,800
deniers at the moment

01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,400
if you have any questions please contact

01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:33,280
miloti directly

01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,600
thank you to multi that was a great talk

01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,560
yeah

01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:38,719
thank you too and yeah don't hesitate to

01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:42,480
give questions

01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:49,840
directly yeah and we take a five minutes

01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:49,840
break now see you after five minutes

01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,600
hello everyone welcome back so now

01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:30,840
our next speaker is martha who's going

01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:33,840
to get talk on an ear in kitty from

01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,840
outside

01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:51,280
hello baby thank you thank you everyone

01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:51,280
for coming

01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:59,199
what is happening katie it looks like a

01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:02,320
very simple question

01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:04,320
but try to ask five different people

01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:07,679
and i'm wondering uh what kind of

01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,679
answers you are going to get

01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,719
doing a small experiment you are going

01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:16,159
to find

01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,159
very very different answers

01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,040
much depending on which kind of social

01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:24,400
idea of

01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:28,320
or new sites those people are using

01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:32,800
an idea for this talk came to me um

01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:36,080
as i started to read

01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:38,400
a little less of kde

01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,360
developers blog and a little more of

01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,159
general

01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:44,159
news because of lack of time to read all

01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:47,760
that is happening

01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:49,440
for the developers in kde and then i

01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:53,280
realized

01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:58,159
that depending on the new source

01:28:53,280 --> 01:29:00,480
i get a completely different view of kde

01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,480
so

01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:09,600
as of someone with a research

01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:13,600
background let's do some research

01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:17,280
when we start research we define the

01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,280
observation time period

01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:22,400
from academy to academy from september

01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:26,560
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:29,760
to august 2020 so

01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,719
what were the important kde events

01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:34,159
during that time

01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,480
please use the chat and write down what

01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:37,520
you

01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:39,920
think was important

01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:44,000
what do you find important what you've

01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:44,000
read on the different news sites

01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:50,639
from the academy the academy the academy

01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,639
of 2019

01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,840
included

01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,560
of course there were a lot of things

01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,679
happening

01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:04,800
and if we just go to the

01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:04,800
official kde news sites we'll find

01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:10,400
the release posts will find developers

01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:15,280
blogs

01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:15,280
enormous amount of information

01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:23,600
so in the analysis i did

01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:27,040
i assume that you are reading

01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:30,639
or listening a single news source

01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:32,880
reading a website listening to a podcast

01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:35,520
my discovery of the last year are linux

01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:38,800
related podcast so i had to cover

01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:41,840
a little bit of that and

01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,960
the new sites i have analyzed it's my

01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:46,639
personal choice

01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:49,920
the things i read all the things i found

01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:52,000
interesting to tell you about there were

01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:55,600
more i investigated

01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:59,040
but i think that

01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:04,239
we can cover just a little bit

01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:04,239
and then you will see what

01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:08,320
what shows up from it

01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:17,600
i decided not to use

01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:20,320
a social media so only new sites

01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,320
podcasts

01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:27,760
uh and no social media for

01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:28,719
very practical reasons social media is

01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,760
pretty hard

01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:33,280
to grab and analyze and there's a lot of

01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,679
buzz

01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,120
so it's complicated to work with this

01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:40,159
data

01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:40,159
and the other

01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:44,320
the other point was that you are

01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:47,360
probably aware

01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:49,920
depending on on who you are

01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,800
social media gives you different content

01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,000
depending of

01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,639
all the things you are reading other

01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,719
things you

01:31:54,639 --> 01:32:01,199
like for me and from every one of you

01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:02,639
facebook other social media gifts

01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:07,440
completely different things

01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:12,320
so i found that it's not very reliable

01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:14,880
to look into yes instagram also

01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:15,840
as jonathan suggests it also gives

01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,040
different things

01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,679
that can be an idea for some further

01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:24,000
research

01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:24,000
in the future but

01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:27,280
but for the next one so i can see that

01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,560
there is

01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:33,760
already um there are some ideas

01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:36,880
in the chat we have kd working more in

01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:39,520
on wayland monthly app updates

01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,719

01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:45,120
plasma 5 18 lts

01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:49,280
and the kt instagram is probably very

01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:52,239
influential

01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,360
i guess so haven't checked out i guess

01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:56,880
so

01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,880
with the nice screenshots

01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,400
how i organized the results i present to

01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:05,360
you

01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:06,800
i start from the sites where i found

01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:09,920
less

01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:12,719
reference to kde and then

01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:15,440
i'm going forward with more and more

01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:15,440
references

01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:25,920
so let's get started

01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:29,040
if the only thing you were reading

01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,040
was tech republic

01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:34,639
you will learn foreign

01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:39,920
in november last year there was an

01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:42,880
interview with fedora project leader

01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:45,520
who was mentioning the kde spin as one

01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:48,400
of the project

01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,400
that there is

01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:55,520
then in the middle of here we have had

01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:58,239
an article about which

01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:58,719
linux user interface is best for which

01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:02,159
kind

01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:04,800
of um what type of audience

01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:06,800
and they decided that the plasma is the

01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,480
best for admins

01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,960
and there was one article about

01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:14,000
distribution-specific

01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:17,199
laptops and in featured slim book

01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:21,120
um for example and then

01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:23,600
quite recently there was one article

01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:25,920
with the title i'm still not switching

01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:29,840
for no

01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:33,440
um talking about new features of the kd

01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:37,760
still but with a conclusion as you can

01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:40,960
as you can probably imagine so

01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:44,080
not very much nothing probably from the

01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:48,719
list i have written in the chat

01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:48,719
let's go forward to another site

01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:56,639
linux weekly news that's

01:34:52,960 --> 01:35:01,040
a little bit more complex it's a more

01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:04,639
linux a lot of kernel in-depth articles

01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:08,159
and what do we find here

01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:08,159
not to 2019

01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:15,600
but in 2020 it starts

01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:18,560
to appear more we have a point about the

01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,560
plasma big string

01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:26,880
we have a point about the

01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:29,440
cute licensing uh linking to the

01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,639
famous post on the kd community mailing

01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:33,119
list

01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:35,040
about the issues between the cute

01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:37,280
foundation and kd

01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:39,920
i guess that probably everyone is a

01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:43,840
little bit aware of that story

01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,840
and we also do have

01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:51,600
a pretty big covering of caden life

01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:54,719
and two versions so we have 2004

01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:58,159
and we have 2008

01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:58,960
uh later in the year we have the release

01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:02,719
of plasma

01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:06,000
5 19 but not 5 18

01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:06,000
and we have the digicam

01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,880
release also so you can probably see

01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:16,159
that we have

01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:20,639
the big the big releases

01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:20,639
we have some preferred applications here

01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:29,440
for some for some a little bit

01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:33,119
surprising finally

01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:36,400
and the very

01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:41,199
big important open source

01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:46,159
facing issue of the sensing of of cute

01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:49,360
now we are moving forward

01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:49,360
and we'll change

01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:57,920
the place and the way of

01:36:53,679 --> 01:37:00,719
accessing the media linux unblocked

01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:01,440
it's a one of very popular linux plug

01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:04,560
linux

01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:08,400
podcasts um

01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,880
getting out every week from my point of

01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,600
view

01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,000
very much distribution oriented and very

01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:15,119
much

01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,840
user oriented they invite

01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:21,679
developers but they they are very much

01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:24,000
oriented to the end user

01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:26,400
how the sysadmins and advanced linux

01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,400
user

01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:30,239
can configure and work with their

01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:33,040
systems

01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:33,040
and we have

01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:40,320
even more kde stuff

01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:44,159
um i would probably

01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:46,880
start with the plus

01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:48,800
going a little bit mixed uh in the time

01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:51,360
because the chronologica

01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,480
that coming in time here may be a little

01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:55,760
bit complicated

01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:59,920
we have the plasma releases 5 17

01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:01,340
15 we have

01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,040
the

01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:08,000
[Music]

01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:08,000
mangiaro with plasma that gets reviewed

01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:14,400
we have um the review

01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:14,880
in general of plasma different points of

01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:20,800
view

01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:20,800
on plasma in the distribu review episode

01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:28,000
and we do have

01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,520
a little bit of hardware we have the

01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:33,119
kubuntu focus

01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:36,080
we have the manjaro kde on pinbuck

01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:37,199
and what's interesting we do have the

01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:42,560
them covering

01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:42,560
the neon based on the latest ubuntu

01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,840
2004.

01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:51,280
from the things that are less known

01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,239
on the other sides um i would like to

01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:55,440
know

01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:57,679
to point out that they have

01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:59,520
mentioned the fact that kd was looking

01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:01,920
for a project manager

01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,040
that's one of the episodes when the

01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:08,000
search was

01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:08,000
in progress they were talking about it

01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:13,840
and now

01:39:15,119 --> 01:39:18,800
something that i couldn't put on the

01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:21,760
timeline because there was a little bit

01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,760
too much of it

01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:28,239
from on a phoronix you

01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:30,239
basically have an article every three to

01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:33,520
four days

01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:38,000
when i look at just the kd summaries

01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:41,840
page there were four pages for the

01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,840
uh for the year

01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:49,360
what we do have being covered

01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:52,719
every time he shows up is the nate's

01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:56,000
blog post uh the week in kde

01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:58,880
which is summarized on the site

01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,880
every single week

01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:04,639
and we do have the plasma mobile weekly

01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:05,840
when it was published it was also

01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:09,199
summarized

01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:12,080
on the site

01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:13,920
now they are covering also a lot of kde

01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:17,360
releases

01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:20,159
quite obviously

01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:21,600
there are all of the plasma releases the

01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:25,920
framework releases

01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,920
and the kde applications

01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:34,320
as as a blog but they also cover

01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:38,800
the big the big applications like

01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:41,920
digicam can develop canon live krita

01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:44,960
but surprisingly also

01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:45,520
some of those that are a bit a bit i

01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:48,880
think

01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:51,920
less popular like the 20 desktop

01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:55,040
kml online that went

01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:59,119
and they

01:40:55,040 --> 01:41:02,800
also covered the keween ft

01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:05,520
fork for those who missed it

01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,000
because they were reading all the sites

01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:09,199
uh

01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:12,239
that is the first work um to make

01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:15,280
key win better on weyland

01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:18,719
and that got covered multiple times

01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:21,760
you probably noticed it also on the awn

01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:24,800
net that was also mentioned but

01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:27,280
only once first

01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,280
part

01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:33,440
and the second word they are also

01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:36,880
covering the developer's blog posts

01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:40,080
i listed a few names

01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:43,840
that got covered

01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:47,199
and there were some various posts

01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:51,040
about the conference presentations about

01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:51,920
hardware i found a point about kubuntu

01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:54,320
focus

01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:56,719
a few of them but i didn't find anything

01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:59,760
about slim book

01:41:56,719 --> 01:42:02,560
they covered the gitlab immigration

01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:04,159
they covered the big screen initiative

01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,920
and they had an article

01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:15,840
about the kde events in december

01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:15,840
summarizing the whole year 2019

01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:29,280
and now a few takeaways

01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:32,239
from the whole from the whole thing

01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:34,719
i was looking what the news sites do

01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,719
pick up

01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,560
and i found out that there is a

01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,440
different

01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,560
kb year on each of those and there's no

01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:45,520
covet

01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:46,239
if you look at kde there's absolutely no

01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,400
covet

01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:54,239
in there the releases

01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:57,280
they matter maybe not all of them

01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:59,600
but they get covered good release

01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:03,520
documentation

01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:06,719
materials related to the risk they

01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:09,760
do happen they do

01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:10,639
make difference and they will get get

01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,280
taken

01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:13,920
by the new site plasma definitely is a

01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:16,960
thing

01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:19,600
but also the big applications the big

01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,600
application

01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:25,360
in this year what got covered on the

01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:28,800
hardware side

01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:31,840
were laptops no phones what's

01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:35,360
whatsoever didn't find anything

01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:39,119
about kdeon phones this year

01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:42,239
and that's probably

01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:45,280
understandable for most of you

01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:46,239
the big changes happening the project be

01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:50,719
them

01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:53,760
good or bad like licensing

01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:55,600
changes or licensing issues

01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,440
like the conflicts happening in the

01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:00,880
project

01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,880
like fox

01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:11,679
if they happen they have a big chance

01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,679
to be taken by the news sites

01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:19,280
my suggestions for people working on

01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:23,280
projects

01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:26,159
if you want to get covered

01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,159
what you can do

01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:34,000
weekly news from projects communities

01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:38,159
and applications

01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:40,239
that's something that gets read and

01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:42,639
maybe not every single time but from

01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:46,639
from time to time the information

01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:49,280
goes out and is covered

01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:50,000
detailed blog posts for example about

01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:54,320
the design

01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:58,000
decisions big behind the big changes

01:44:54,320 --> 01:45:01,360
and the modifications that are very much

01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,719
visible to the user that's something

01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:06,239
that

01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:10,000
if you write a blog post about it it

01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:14,400
can become become popular

01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:19,760
and transmitted by the by the innocence

01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:23,440
i also think i can even bet to that

01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:24,320
if someone starts writing what is new in

01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:29,199
plasma

01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:32,880
or nkd in a given distribution

01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:35,280
in the new version that is likely to get

01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:39,040
covered

01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:39,840
definitely the changes in kde happen at

01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,400
some point

01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,760
but the moment when it shows up in the

01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:46,320
distribution

01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,199
it's a different moment of time many

01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:50,480
people will be

01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:52,960
interested in knowing that

01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:53,760
some of those changes did come to their

01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:56,960
distribution

01:45:53,760 --> 01:46:00,000
right now hardware running kd

01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:03,679
last point that is

01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:06,960
definitely interesting to people

01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:08,080
and if you write about hardware running

01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:11,360
on kde

01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:15,360
playing laptops paid phones beats

01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:15,360
watches or whatever you can find

01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:21,679
i would say it's going to be covered

01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,880
before we wrap up and we go to the

01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:25,280
questions

01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:27,679
a little bit a footnote about the data

01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:29,840
analysis

01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:31,840
as a developer i wanted to automate

01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:35,360
things so

01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:37,679
i will grab the error recession

01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,679
but

01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:43,920
the number of keywords related to kde

01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:50,159
is big because we have to cover

01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,880
kd we have to cover plasma we have to

01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:54,239
cover

01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,840
all of the biggest applications

01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:57,520
and the feeds do not cover the whole

01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,040
year but that's probably i can work

01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:01,840
around

01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:02,639
on the other hand there's the abstract

01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:06,000
of the news

01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:09,040
and there is the news itself

01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:11,360
for some sites the kde is not

01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:13,600
even in the abstract it is in the

01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:16,400
content of the article so you

01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,760
have to look for desktop review for

01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:21,280
distribution review

01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:24,400
and then look into the article itself

01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:25,440
to find out if the kde is covered in

01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:28,560
there

01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:32,000
so finally most of the analysis was done

01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:33,760
manually not all of it

01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,639
if you know about the truth i'm

01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:39,840
interested and i'm also wondering that

01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:43,040
with all of those keywords maybe i can

01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,440
do some artificial intelligence next

01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,239
time

01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:47,840
for the next analysis that may be

01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:51,119
interesting

01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:55,920
interesting experience and now

01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:55,920
we'll go to the questions

01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:09,360
it was a great talk martha thank you

01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:11,600
so uh yeah we have a question

01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:13,199
the monthly app updates don't tend to

01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:18,320
get many pointers

01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:21,360
isn't that a problem in the format

01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:25,600
a good question um

01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:28,090
i'm not sure why it gets no

01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,600
uh no updates um

01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:32,920
[Music]

01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:34,719
no uh no news um

01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:38,000
[Music]

01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:40,400
i can i can look into that maybe there

01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,719
is some uh some issue with their

01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:44,880
referencing

01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:47,600
i would say that it's definitely

01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:50,800
something that has a potential

01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:54,880
to be heavily linked and

01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:58,560
i can i can look into that and

01:48:54,880 --> 01:49:01,840
try to suggest what what you can do to

01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,840
to make it more popular

01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:08,480
okay great one more question

01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:09,119
can you come to promo and help us out

01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,440
there

01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:12,840
we collect a lot of data but could us

01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:16,239
could use your

01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:19,199
advice yeah yeah definitely

01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:21,520
that's something i would i will do soon

01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:23,679
um

01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,880
coming back a little bit more in the

01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:26,960
development and

01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:30,719
in the in the data analysis definitely i

01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:33,760
can help the promo team with with that

01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:35,840
okay we have another question

01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:37,679
there is a link which you will be able

01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:40,560
to see in the shared notes

01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:43,280
uh if you're interested in hard data

01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:44,320
regarding coverage of kde news blogs and

01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:47,440
so on

01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:50,320
i think it's not a question yeah

01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:51,520
but very interesting i take i take a

01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:53,920
note of the link

01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,800
i wasn't aware so i'm taking it

01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:58,320
differently

01:49:54,800 --> 01:50:00,480
something to look into for me yeah and

01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:04,159
one person is asking

01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:04,159
any good podcast you looked at

01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:13,199
depending what we are searching for

01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:14,800
um there are a lot of linux podcasts out

01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:18,320
there

01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:20,719
and depending on what kind of content

01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:24,800
you're looking for

01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:28,639
if it's more of an admin user

01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:30,880
linux unplugged for that it's very good

01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:31,840
there are podcasts about new people

01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:36,960
coming to

01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:40,400
linux about more beginner stuff

01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,800
um i can probably come with some names

01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:44,000
but

01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:47,119
but i they do not come just right now

01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:50,639
uh you search in your favorite

01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:53,199
uh search engine for linux

01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:55,679
linux podcasts this also for example the

01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:58,960
ubuntu podcast that is pretty good

01:50:55,679 --> 01:51:02,400
um on

01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:04,239
my suggestion is go look for for those

01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:07,440
podcasts there are a lot of them

01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:09,040
listen to an episode or two and you and

01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:10,800
you will make your mind

01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:13,040
finding out if it's interesting for you

01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:15,199
or not that's uh that's the way i'm

01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:18,159
doing it

01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:19,199
okay great so that's it thank you so

01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:22,320
much martha

01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:24,480
yeah thank you thank you thank you we

01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:25,920
take a short five minutes break and then

01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:35,840
our next speakers will be there

01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:35,840
thank you

01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:24,800
hello everyone five minute break i'm

01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:27,199
looking forward to the next talk

01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,960
then i guess you're getting set up i

01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:32,880
don't know if you

01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,880
you have a co-speaker andrew

01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:42,880
i hope everything is working well there

01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,280
you can test the audio briefly just to

01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,320
know

01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:46,320
oh hi andrew

01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:51,599
i don't hear you um so the trick is to

01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:55,119
click leave audio and then join audio

01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:55,119
again it has this little headphone

01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,840
symbol

01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,520
so then i hear you perfect uh andrew if

01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:15,760
you

01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:19,760
click rejoining the audio um

01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,760
then hopefully we get it up and running

01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:29,599
we still can't hear you sadly

01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:31,280
yeah now you have joined with uh audio

01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:33,440
and now you're muted so if you click the

01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:37,599
mute button one more time we're probably

01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:41,280
yeah that sounds good to me yay

01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:43,199
excellent welcome academy 2020 the very

01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:44,639
special edition

01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:46,239
the one everybody has been looking

01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:49,280
forward to and

01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:52,480
i love how we have some slightly

01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:54,639
off the standard kde development

01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:57,760
talks this year this is going to be one

01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:59,679
of them i think it's just so exciting

01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:01,360
yesterday it was interesting to learn

01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:05,040
about open source and dentists

01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:05,520
today we have tale wiggling that is just

01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:09,040
so

01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:09,760
cool uh yes we need to wait three more

01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:11,679
minutes

01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:12,880
uh in the meantime everybody gets

01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:16,000
excited uh

01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:19,040
you can show that in the chat yeah

01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:22,239
we are getting uh all filed up uh

01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:25,760
dan i don't know uh if you have a

01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:27,520
video for us um

01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:30,239
i'm seeing a button that says webcam

01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:30,239
sharing locked

01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:34,480
um let's try

01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:42,480
oh you no you should be

01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:42,880
uh i don't quite know i can't try and

01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:45,520
make

01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,119
you the presenter which uh i don't know

01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:50,320
if that helps

01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:52,239
nope uh can you try

01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:55,280
no you do have audio that makes no sense

01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:55,280
to me okay

01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,119
in the worst case you can quickly leave

01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:01,360
the room and rejoin and

01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:02,800
we can try to give you rights again i'm

01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:05,199
actually yeah i think

01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:06,239
i'll give that a quick shot it normally

01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:08,239
works

01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:10,000
i'll do that yeah sorry for that the ui

01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:11,280
of big blue button generally it works

01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,639
really nicely i think and

01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:18,480
uh awesome team but sometimes it's a bit

01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:20,080
clumsy so we'll just try to get all the

01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:23,440
technical

01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:26,800
bits figured out uh before i didn't know

01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:30,239
about uh the tail company before

01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:33,840
uh reading the program so great to learn

01:55:30,239 --> 01:55:33,840
new stuff

01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:41,119
i'm still seeing a locked

01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:41,119
webcam what in the world

01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:46,719
i was just testing it in the uh

01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:49,679
oh i have i think i've done something

01:55:46,719 --> 01:55:49,679
stupid moment

01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:52,880
uh see

01:55:53,440 --> 01:56:01,679
no no no no yeah so

01:55:57,440 --> 01:56:03,920
a really dumb thing you must not do

01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:03,920
is

01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:15,840
is turn on the options for

01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:21,440
yeah really dumb thing you must not do

01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:24,480
is turn on the options to not

01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:24,800
have webcams in a room if you want to

01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:28,159
share

01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:31,280
your webcam yeah oops okay

01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:34,880

do you have a presentation here yeah i

01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:42,400
think you can update one

01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:42,400
converting

01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:49,119
that's awesome i think uh you both seem

01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:51,520
technically set up

01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:54,080
to get the presentation running in the

01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:58,080
meantime let's warm up the chat

01:56:54,080 --> 01:57:01,679
is anyone else excited i am excited

01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:04,880
very good the highlight of today's

01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:05,280
uh presentations i'm sure the highlight

01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,480
of the

01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:11,520
enemy are we

officially really start

01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:20,719
so you can take one last deep breath uh

01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:22,400

what's that i don't know uh

01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:25,679
some animal i guess at least for me the

01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:29,920
mic

01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:32,710

oh now that's a skunk i think yeah it

01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:43,760
looks very skunk-like yeah

01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:45,280
excellent though at least jonathan is

01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:49,040
happy to see you guys

01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:50,719

not entirely sure

01:57:54,719 --> 01:58:00,080
give it up for andrew and then looking

01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:03,760
forward to learn about the tail company

01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:05,599
go people excellent do you

01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:07,119
uh linear do you want to kick off and

01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:08,320
say a few words or should i just take

01:58:07,119 --> 01:58:11,760
presenter and start

01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:13,119
rolling go for it okay let me click this

01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:16,480
button here

01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:17,199
okay so um we haven't got very long in

01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:18,639
fact uh

01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:20,639
we've got five minutes less than we

01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:22,000
thought so i'm going to

01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:24,159
compress what i was going to talk about

01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:27,040
really into sort of two parts

01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:28,080
um i'm a i'm an artist i'm a sculptor

01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,520
and

01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:31,119
i was part of a group of artists still

01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:33,440
have in fact called grey world and we

01:58:31,119 --> 01:58:34,880
make public art usually in urban spaces

01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,920
and we've been doing this for a very

01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:39,280
long time

01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:40,719
about 25 years um it's

01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,880
i'm going to whiz through that a little

01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:44,239
bit because it's important just very

01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:46,880
quickly to understand

01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:48,080
why we ended up creating tails and

01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:50,400
animatronic ears

01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:52,000
why that might be something uh where it

01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:53,440
comes from actually the journey very

01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,119
very briefly the journey that we've just

01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,679
got in discovery really because it turns

01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:57,280
out

01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:58,960
that there are lots and lots of reasons

01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,560
why people want to wear tails and ears

01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:02,480
and i i my set of reasons

01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,920
are are mine and unique to me but there

01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:07,360
are many people with very different

01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:08,880
other kinds of uh you know interests so

01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:11,920
very very briefly let me skip this

01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:11,920
forward um

01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:17,840
i'm professor of public art at

01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:19,440
goldsmiths university of london

01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,080
what that really entails is ways in

01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:23,599
which we investigate and play with

01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:25,920
different ways of interacting in public

01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:28,080
space so i'm really interested in the

01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:30,400
methodology the ways in which

01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:31,840
simple interaction can create something

01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:34,000
fantastic or fabulous

01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,960
memorable um something fleeting

01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,639
something ephemeral

01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:38,080
and these are the kinds of things that

01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:39,760
that uh we research

01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:41,280
um if you think about it grey world

01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:42,719
really is the is the thing that i've

01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:43,679
been spending most of my time with for a

01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:45,199
long time and

01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:46,560
the professorship was an interesting way

01:59:45,199 --> 01:59:47,440
of actually sort of going a little bit

01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:50,719
deeper

01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:52,159
and i set up grey order in 93 the first

01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:53,920
interactive artwork that i did and this

01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:55,199
will give you a start start to give you

01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:56,320
a flavor of the kind of things that i'm

01:59:55,199 --> 01:59:58,000
personally interested in

01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:59,920
you know when you're a child and you

01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,560
pick up a stick and you run it along

01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,679
railings

02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:05,360
and get that lovely sound we took a set

02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:06,719
of railings and we tuned them

02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:08,639
so when you ran a stick along it it

02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:11,599
played the girl from iponema

02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:12,400
now from my point of view what that is

02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:13,760
as a public

02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:15,599
work of art is important but it's just

02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:17,440
as important as what it isn't you know

02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:18,080
isn't some big bronze statue with a you

02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:20,480
know

02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:21,440
uh traffic cone on his head it's a

02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:24,480
method of creating

02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:25,840
interaction so um over the years we've

02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,040
made lots of different projects and i'm

02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:28,320
going to gloss through these very

02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:30,880
quickly if you're interested

02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:32,960
please go to greyworld.org you can see

02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:35,360
hundreds of hundreds of projects but

02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:36,080
let me start by showing you some uh some

02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:38,080
quick videos

02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:39,520
of some projects that we've done let's

02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:42,560
see if this works

02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:43,920
of course it's going to work i'm going

02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:44,960
to show a video by clicking on this

02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:48,159
little thing down here

02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:49,520
actions is that right there we are

02:00:48,159 --> 02:00:55,119
sharing external video

02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:56,880
paste it in there and hit go

02:00:55,119 --> 02:00:58,560
after two centuries of trading at the

02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:00,320
same site in the city of london

02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:02,719
the stock exchange is moving to a

02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:04,800
striking new home

02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:06,560
after two of each other two centuries of

02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:07,119
trading at the same site in the city of

02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,880
london

02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:10,159
the stock exchange is moving to a

02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:12,080
striking new home

02:01:10,159 --> 02:01:13,280
next to st paul's cathedral the queen

02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:15,520
opened the building today

02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:17,679
with all eyes on the rather beguiling

02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:19,920
work of art which forms the centerpiece

02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:22,639
of the new stock exchange as june kelly

02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:23,920
now explains so this is an eight-story

02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:27,199
home

02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:27,199
please don't worry terrified

02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,480
it was perhaps one of the most unusual

02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,960
invitations the queen has ever received

02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:37,199
she pressed one electronic ball and more

02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:39,040
than 700 others suspended on metal

02:01:37,199 --> 02:01:40,960
cables began to move

02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:42,960
the balls are the centerpiece and

02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:44,159
talking point of the new stock exchange

02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:45,360
building

02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:47,280
what we've tried to do with this

02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:48,239
sculpture is create something which

02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:50,400
makes physical

02:01:48,239 --> 02:01:51,760
the ephemeral nature of the stock market

02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:53,360
for many it's a very

02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:55,199
what i'm trying to do there is to make

02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:56,480
physical what is to many people a

02:01:55,199 --> 02:01:58,400
completely mysterious thing i mean the

02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:00,880
stock markets trades go up and down

02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:02,400
we try to make a 3d sculpture sculpture

02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:04,000
which you can model almost anything

02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,280
by sending those fears to different

02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,480
parts of the atrium i'm going to

02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:07,679
withdraw i could talk about just that

02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:09,840
one for about a month but

02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:10,960
i think you might you might all just uh

02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:12,560
want to kill yourself so i'm going to

02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:17,280
show you something else really quickly

02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:20,800
um uh i proceed click on here down here

02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:21,599
stop sharing external video sharing some

02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:24,960
video here we go

paste it in there this is another

02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:29,440
kind of interactive work uh this is a

02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:32,180
project called paint

02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:34,560
um let's see if it will start playing

02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:38,980

i've always wanted to make a rainbow and

02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:02,320
i wanted to make the biggest

02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:04,400
brightest gayest rainbow i could

02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:07,040
possibly make to celebrate

02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,480
and so we decided to create something

02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:10,630
over the house of parliament in the

02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:13,770
center of london

02:04:10,630 --> 02:04:13,770
[Music]

02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:17,920
we put the water from

02:04:19,890 --> 02:04:25,840
[Music]

02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:25,840
here

02:04:26,550 --> 02:04:32,740
[Music]

02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:44,159
[Music]

02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:45,679
okay sorry there's so many things that i

02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:48,560
could show but really what i wanted to

02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:49,679
get across is the idea that our work is

02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:53,199
about play

02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:54,400
it's about uh often gentle methods of

02:04:53,199 --> 02:04:56,639
interaction

02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:57,599
and creating situations which are

02:04:56,639 --> 02:04:58,960
playful

02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:00,639
but also give you a sense of being

02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:02,960
creative in some way

02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:04,480
um you've seen the the things that are

02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:05,280
actually not going to show gravity after

02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:08,480
all but

02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:11,920
um and that leads leads me to

02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:14,079
to tales you know um

02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,520
it's been amazing i just wanted to have

02:05:14,079 --> 02:05:15,920
a tale i've always wanted to have a tale

02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:17,760
i think

02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:19,280
evolution has been particularly cruel in

02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:22,159
that regard you know

02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:23,840
um when i look at my cat and i wonder

02:05:22,159 --> 02:05:25,119
what's going on in his mind it's often

02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:26,719
his tail

02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:29,040
which really gives me the sense of his

02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:31,760
mood and for me

02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:34,320
the experiments with tails really

02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:37,679
started off as a gray world installation

02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:38,320
they were opportunities to create really

02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:41,520
interesting

02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:42,639
and exciting little creative moments in

02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:45,840
a city

02:05:42,639 --> 02:05:47,440
so you can imagine for example uh

02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:49,360
being well dressed and going into the

02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:50,960
bank but having your tail not the

02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:52,159
pencils off when you're applying for an

02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:54,560
overdraft

02:05:52,159 --> 02:05:56,400
or you can imagine sitting next to

02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:58,320
somebody that you you're attracted to

02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:59,440
and whilst you're unable to actually

02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:01,920
express yourself

02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:03,440
your tail is making it very clear that

02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:05,040
you're particularly interested in the

02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:08,239
person who you're sitting next to

02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:10,960
for me it was a wonderful extension of

02:06:08,239 --> 02:06:12,480
humanity really but also it was an

02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:13,920
opportunity to create little

02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,760
special moments that perhaps you

02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:17,840
wouldn't be able to create without one

02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:19,599
and so the tail company was born it

02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:22,000
started off as an installation for

02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:24,239
with great as i say um let me just show

02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,920
you our first prototype

02:06:24,239 --> 02:06:30,960
let's see if this works um

02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:32,480
click the button and paste the link like

02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:33,760
that

02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:36,560
so this is our first prototype this is

02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:36,560
2006.

02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:42,639
and you might have noticed i'm i'm not

02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:45,840
shy

02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:59,840
the original outfit idea was top hat

02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:29,679
i've just watched this guy walking apart

02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:41,840
that's how cool

02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:55,840
is

02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:09,520
we were very interested in that that

02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:12,400
opportunity that creative opportunity

02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:13,040
every time i showed the tale every time

02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:16,960
i did

02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:19,199
a talk or a speech wearing a tail

02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,079
or in an urban space people kept saying

02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:22,400
i want a tail

02:08:20,079 --> 02:08:24,239
i i've always wanted a tale i had to

02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:26,480
tell when i was a kid i made one out of

02:08:24,239 --> 02:08:28,320
some material and i suddenly realized it

02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:29,280
was a kind of universal feeling that for

02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:32,079
many people

02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:34,159
it was a childhood thing and for some

02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:36,719
far more than we can probably imagine

02:08:34,159 --> 02:08:38,480
it's something that that is still there

02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:39,360
into into adulthood and i was delighted

02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:41,520
to hear this

02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:42,960
we set up the chat the tower company and

02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:46,079
um yeah we ended up with

02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:48,719
with um with with a business um

02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:49,440
and so let me just show you this let's

02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:51,679
see

02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:54,079
which one i've chosen okay so this is

02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:55,840
just a a selection of tails

02:08:54,079 --> 02:08:57,599
um not not that many either i just kind

02:08:55,840 --> 02:09:00,320
of edited it together

02:08:57,599 --> 02:09:01,679
uh the original tails were remote

02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:04,000
controlled

02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:05,440
uh they have nine moves and you can call

02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:08,719
them up on a remote

02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:11,440
um and i was absolutely blessed

02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:12,079
to to to meet linear who allowed us

02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:14,880
really to

02:09:12,079 --> 02:09:16,159
take that into a new direction and open

02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:18,560
up all the possibilities that the

02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:21,920
software would give us um

02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:25,040
let me just show you what i mean by that

02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:26,719
by copying this one there's uh

02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:28,480
you know we can basically our tails the

02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:32,000
digitals which are are the app

02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:33,840
control towers which linear wrote um

02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,440
can learn new tricks that at the moment

02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:36,239
we're just adding the feature so that as

02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:39,040
you walk

02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:41,199
the tail can work out your speed and

02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:41,520
your motion and create moves based on

02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:44,239
that

02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:46,400
on the fly um recently we've added move

02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:48,159
alarms and we've added all kinds of

02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:49,760
uh new things and that's the wonderful

02:09:48,159 --> 02:09:52,880
thing about breaking out of

02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:54,800
of the hardware there and allowing big

02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:55,760
brains to to come along and solve some

02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:58,079
other problems

02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:59,199
and most recently of all coming of time

02:09:58,079 --> 02:10:01,760
two minutes over

02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:02,560
um most recent of all we've started

02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:05,119
playing

02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:06,480
with ears which i'm just going to show

02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:15,190
you this

02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:27,249
beautifully they sync with the tails

02:10:15,190 --> 02:10:27,249
[Music]

02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:31,040
great guitar player too so the point is

02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:33,040
um

02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:34,480
it's an ecosystem to use that cheesy

02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:36,400
word but it really is if you've got

02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:37,920
digital and you've got the ears they can

02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:41,360
now sync together

02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:43,440
um they are something that that is being

02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:44,960
actively developed i mean they're out

02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:46,320
now people are getting them getting them

02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:48,000
and there's things that we'll we'll keep

02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:50,880
adding and adding and adding changing

02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,199
things to them as as life goes on but

02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:55,920
it's been a real um

02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:56,639
a really exciting little journey so far

02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:59,679
and um

02:10:56,639 --> 02:11:00,639
as i say thanks to linear and uh their

02:10:59,679 --> 02:11:02,880
skills

02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:03,760
um and uh their understanding of kde

02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:06,239
which i'm sure

02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:07,520
and the blockchain this system line of

02:11:06,239 --> 02:11:09,119
software i think we're going to

02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:11,119
uh have a very interesting kind of

02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:13,040
future if anybody is interested

02:11:11,119 --> 02:11:14,560
in getting hold of them please put the

02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:17,040
word kde talk

02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,760
in the box on the checkout if you are

02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,520
interested

02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:21,280
if you do i will put some special

02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:22,480
presents in there only for people who've

02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:25,040
sat ahead and

02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:26,239
handled me for 12 minutes okay so i'm

02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:29,679
gonna i'm gonna

02:11:26,239 --> 02:11:29,679
hand over to labia right now

02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:36,840
all yours mate all right let me just uh

02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:39,679
see if i can do this take presenter all

02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:43,119
right there we go

02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:44,480
right so um uh

02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:46,719
some of you will already know me but

02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:49,679
i'll quickly run through uh who i am

02:11:46,719 --> 02:11:51,679
um i have been a member of the kd

02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:53,679
community since

02:11:51,679 --> 02:11:55,440
about as long as i can really remember

02:11:53,679 --> 02:12:00,400
doing computery things but

02:11:55,440 --> 02:12:03,360
since 2002 my first academy was in 2007

02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:04,079
which was in glasgow of all places i

02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:07,760
have tales

02:12:04,079 --> 02:12:11,599
come and talk um

02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:14,639
and sort of my main work

02:12:11,599 --> 02:12:14,960
has been through uh the unfortunately

02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:18,159
now

02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:20,960
defunct gluon but

02:12:18,159 --> 02:12:23,040
many things came out of that and so

02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:26,320
there's a whole lot of stuff

02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:26,639
uh which yeah grew out of gluon which is

02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:29,679
now

02:12:26,639 --> 02:12:35,840
in all sorts of places throughout

02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:35,840
um used throughout kd's software stack

02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:46,400
and yeah

02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:49,760
my main interaction

02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:52,079
all my my day job right now is with

02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:53,360
uh blue systems and effectively i'm

02:12:52,079 --> 02:12:56,639
sponsored to work

02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:59,440
on various bits of the kde

02:12:56,639 --> 02:12:59,920
uh software stack uh most notably that

02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:03,199
would be

02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:06,400
kirigami which we use for the

02:13:03,199 --> 02:13:10,000
app that controls these things uh i'm

02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:13,199
also the maintainer of peruse

02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:15,199
which is a comic book reader and i have

02:13:13,199 --> 02:13:18,880
just been told that i should take over

02:13:15,199 --> 02:13:22,320
a ship of k new stuff um which is

02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:26,719
uh the the software that lets

02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:30,079
us interact directly with the kde store

02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:32,480
and occasionally i look like that which

02:13:30,079 --> 02:13:36,320
is kind of how i ended up

02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:41,199
uh in contact with the uh with andrew

02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:41,199
and um and his entire thing

02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:48,800
so uh

02:13:44,719 --> 02:13:51,840
the way i found my way into this was

02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:54,719
you know you look through

02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:55,280
kickstarter and go oh that looks kind of

02:13:54,719 --> 02:13:58,560
cool

02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:59,119
is it a thing i don't know oh wait it is

02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:00,880
a thing

02:13:59,119 --> 02:14:02,880
it's an actual thing that someone has

02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:06,320
made and that it actually

02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:10,159
works so that's neat

02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:12,960
this thing um and

02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:13,360
wait the people that run it are pretty

02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:15,199
cool

02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:17,119
you know you've just seen all of the

02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:19,119
stuff uh

02:14:17,119 --> 02:14:20,639
yeah that that andrew has been involved

02:14:19,119 --> 02:14:22,639
with before and all of

02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:24,000
you know you you know present yourself

02:14:22,639 --> 02:14:24,880
on kickstarter that's the sort of thing

02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,599
you find so

02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:28,400
you know people with you know will and

02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:30,639
skill

02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:31,920
and intention and all of that so you

02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:35,040
know perfect storm of good

02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:37,119
good ideas um and then so i joined the

02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:38,560
telegram chat and we got to talking

02:14:37,119 --> 02:14:40,079
about so what are you going to do with

02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:41,440
the software and oh we don't really know

02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:42,000
yet we've you know we've heard of this

02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:45,599
thing called

02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:47,679
electron which if anybody here has

02:14:45,599 --> 02:14:49,119
worked with that it's basically a

02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:52,159
browser

02:14:49,119 --> 02:14:52,880
um that you use to you know you you

02:14:52,159 --> 02:14:56,320
stick it

02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:57,760
you clone chromium and then you stick

02:14:56,320 --> 02:15:00,159
that in and

02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:01,520
uh in a container and you use that to

02:15:00,159 --> 02:15:04,480
write your apps

02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:06,239
and it can be fine for many things but

02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:09,280
the problem is

02:15:06,239 --> 02:15:09,840
the or the biggest functional problem

02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:12,800
with that

02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:14,159
is if you've got a phone and you put it

02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:16,880
to sleep

02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:19,199
um any electron app will also go to

02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:20,719
sleep so there's no real way

02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:23,360
of having that sort of thing run in the

02:15:20,719 --> 02:15:24,960
background so

02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:26,639
there would have been quite a lot of

02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:29,840
work involved in getting

02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:31,599
that to work in any reasonable way

02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:33,280
an electron would not have helped there

02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:37,199
and so i suggested

02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:39,760
um well we've kind of got a software

02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:43,199
stack that can do a lot of this stuff so

02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:45,760
do you want some help um and then

02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:46,880
uh well i guess i could help out with it

02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:49,040
a bit

02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:50,639
and so you know that thing where you're

02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:53,119
building hardware

02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:55,760
uh you're not really building software

02:15:53,119 --> 02:15:58,480
so how about we make it a gpl

02:15:55,760 --> 02:16:00,159
project and that took like i don't know

02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:02,800
was it five minutes it took you to

02:16:00,159 --> 02:16:02,800
realize that

02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:07,040
um something like that it was pretty

02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:10,239
fast anyway yeah i mean obviously

02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:13,280
uh free software being this kind of

02:16:10,239 --> 02:16:17,440
um liberal arts sort of

02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:20,719
thing to start with it you know it makes

02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:24,560
perfect sense it sort of just

02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:27,119
fits together really well um

02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:29,119
and so that's how you know we ended up

02:16:27,119 --> 02:16:32,160
doing that whole thing

02:16:29,119 --> 02:16:33,599
and so that's a couple of screenshots of

02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:35,840
what the app looks like

02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:37,200
um if you want a closer look i'll give

02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:38,800
you one but

02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:40,800
um we're running through a little bit

02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:45,280
quick here so

02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:49,120
yeah exactly

02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:50,800
um so just a quick list of the things

02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:52,960
that we are already using

02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:55,120
if you want to know more about how to

02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:58,319
work with kde software on

02:16:55,120 --> 02:17:01,920
android and how kde

02:16:58,319 --> 02:17:04,080
stack helps that um there is a talk

02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:05,359
in this room immediately after hours

02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:06,960
except you know a few

02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:08,719
hours down the line i think it's at five

02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:12,080
o'clock uh oh wait

02:17:08,719 --> 02:17:13,280
yeah whatever the next talk uh in this

02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:16,319
room

02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:20,719
is is specifically about that so

02:17:16,319 --> 02:17:24,000
drop by there it's really good um

02:17:20,719 --> 02:17:26,080
and so a couple of specifics for the

02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,519
actual things we use obviously we use

02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:31,359
the um

02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:33,200
the android build docker because

02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:35,439
working with android studio is

02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:38,800
occasionally something of a nightmare

02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:42,880
um so we're using that one to build

02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:44,240
all of our things the android services

02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:47,679
are the things that

02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:51,519
make it possible for this to be off

02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:54,880
and still control the ears and the tail

02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:56,719
um and that's the way you do that is

02:17:54,880 --> 02:18:00,639
using remote objects

02:17:56,719 --> 02:18:03,679
or the easiest way to do it anyway um

02:18:00,639 --> 02:18:05,439
and then obviously for the ui and the

02:18:03,679 --> 02:18:06,639
workflow and all of the pretty things we

02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:09,519
use kirigami

02:18:06,639 --> 02:18:10,160
and the breeze icon set and it's one of

02:18:09,519 --> 02:18:13,519
those

02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:16,960
things where i am unsure

02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:20,000
whether people realize just how much

02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:23,120
power is in having a gigantic

02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:26,399
set of icons like breeze

02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:27,200
um when you're building software it

02:18:26,399 --> 02:18:29,439
makes

02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:31,120
an enormous difference when you don't

02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:33,359
have to go out and

02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:34,319
get you know icons drawn and all of that

02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:36,319
so yeah

02:18:34,319 --> 02:18:38,160
definitely something people will need to

02:18:36,319 --> 02:18:40,960
look at um

02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:41,519
and it's something that we can market to

02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:45,200
people

02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:48,800
out there so yeah very helpful

02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:50,800
um and then there's a couple of future

02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:54,000
bits of work here

02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:55,439
and one of the so i'm just going to

02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:57,040
leave that on there and

02:18:55,439 --> 02:18:58,559
mention gay new stuff because of course

02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:00,559
i am i'm not going to go through a talk

02:18:58,559 --> 02:19:03,679
but i'm not mentioning k new stuff

02:19:00,559 --> 02:19:06,960
so one thing that we did when we came up

02:19:03,679 --> 02:19:09,040
with uh how to make the ears do their

02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:10,559
thing was that we created a small domain

02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:15,200
specific language to

02:19:10,559 --> 02:19:18,240
describe the ways these things wiggle

02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:21,359
and that's just a text file

02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:21,840
which is json and can be put anywhere uh

02:19:21,359 --> 02:19:25,080
really

02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:26,240
and the sort of i the sort of

02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:28,800
semi-midterm

02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:30,639
kind of idea for that is that we would

02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:34,319
like to eventually

02:19:30,639 --> 02:19:37,359
uh make that make it possible to stick

02:19:34,319 --> 02:19:38,880
to share the moves and things that these

02:19:37,359 --> 02:19:41,599
things do

02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:42,479
um and so okay new stuff is the obvious

02:19:41,599 --> 02:19:45,040
choice for that we

02:19:42,479 --> 02:19:46,800
already have all of uh all of the

02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:48,800
functionality there so we've got

02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:51,120
the store for it we've you know we've

02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:54,240
got all the server-side stuff we've got

02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:54,800
uh the um yeah yeah we've got all the

02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:58,720
bits

02:19:54,800 --> 02:20:02,720
that make that work so yeah

02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:04,240
um and then it was very short

02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:06,160
i think we might want to skip that

02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:10,479
because we're now 22 minutes

02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:13,439
yeah and and you're doing it ably anyway

02:20:10,479 --> 02:20:16,160
for sure oh yeah i'm just holding i'm

02:20:13,439 --> 02:20:17,680
holding this little thing here

02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:20,319
what i'd really like to do as well is

02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:22,080
just for one ten seconds just to say

02:20:20,319 --> 02:20:23,600
uh thank you to the people who've

02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:26,479
supported us especially

02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:28,240
dark grew tatsui seki tigris kaldar

02:20:26,479 --> 02:20:30,399
double wagga derpy jen and

02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:31,520
wolfie and not forgetting the grumpiest

02:20:30,399 --> 02:20:35,120
catwall talent

02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:38,240
um we need it because

02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:40,560
a lot of this is is made reflected back

02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:42,399
altered changed and and put back out

02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:43,520
there so we can't really do this at all

02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:46,960
in a bubble

02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:51,040
this is the nature of open source yeah

02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:54,160
yeah there's a lot of interaction all

02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:56,880
various different directions

02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:58,560
awesome stuff uh i think we have now two

02:20:56,880 --> 02:21:00,720
minutes for questions and you

02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:01,760
uh do feel free to demo in the meantime

02:21:00,720 --> 02:21:04,399
i mean just

02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:04,399
entertain them

02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:10,560
yeah well i have i have effectively been

02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:11,200
demoing the whole time i have nothing to

02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:13,760
go

02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:14,880
i haven't touched the phone since we

02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:18,160
started

02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:18,160
um but

02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:23,200
so one of the things that you'll notice

02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:27,840
on this

02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:27,840
is where it says

02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:34,800
digital connected to uh

02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:37,359
yeah that's a thing that we'll need to

02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:40,479
fix it says i'm connected to a tail

02:21:37,359 --> 02:21:42,319
this is not a tail so obviously

02:21:40,479 --> 02:21:44,080
bugs and people notice these things so

02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:46,479
that's you know getting fixed the

02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:47,760
next version but one of the things that

02:21:46,479 --> 02:21:50,399
means is that's how

02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:51,280
android allows you to run stuff in the

02:21:50,399 --> 02:21:54,479
background

02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:56,160
that's right

02:21:54,479 --> 02:21:57,680
fantastic mode called casual mode which

02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:59,840
means you're not sitting there with a

02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:01,840
phone in your hand making it do stuff

02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:03,120
you know i'm feeling in this particular

02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:05,120
kind of emotion

02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:06,720
you can collect a set of moves stick it

02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:09,200
in your pocket and go about your life

02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:10,560
and that was very that's casual mode all

02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:12,960
right the question you guys

02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:14,000
have is actually how do you teach them

02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:17,600
new movements

02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:19,680
mlai new additions in the code data

02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:21,920
well linear is actually just as a

02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:22,640
language now which you can use to create

02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:24,319
moves

02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:26,319
and that was a bit of a mind blower i

02:22:24,319 --> 02:22:28,240
mean for us it was more hardware how you

02:22:26,319 --> 02:22:30,160
move the servos how they use

02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:31,760
so they have now developed that into a

02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:33,920
into a kind of a scripting language

02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:36,960
which allows you to describe them

02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:39,520
and let those moves live so it's very

02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:40,399
the future technically speaking it's a

02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:44,399
json file

02:22:40,399 --> 02:22:47,200
uh but yeah it's a very small list of

02:22:44,399 --> 02:22:48,080
commands that you send over bluetooth

02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:51,280
that makes

02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:53,920
them do things awesome

02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:55,760
i hope many people will uh get one try

02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:56,960
it so good luck you guys that's so

02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:59,520
awesome uh thanks for

02:22:56,960 --> 02:23:00,160

which

02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:49,280
is quite a long break since we want to

02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:51,520
accommodate different time zones a bit

02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:52,560
um we will have another round of halfway

02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:56,720
