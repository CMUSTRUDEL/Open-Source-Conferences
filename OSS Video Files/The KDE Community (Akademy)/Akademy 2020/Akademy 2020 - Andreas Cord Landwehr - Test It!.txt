Publication date: 2020-11-24
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	In this talk, Andreas want to discuss why automated tests are important for your project and how they will help you to develop faster and with less bugs.
On the one hand, Andreas will talk about strategies and how to design (unit and integration) tests. For example, what distinguishes a white box test from a black box test and why are both important? Moreover, Andreas will look into which software architecture patterns exists that make your code better testable. A special concern will be, how this integrates best with Qt and QtQuick based code and the QTest framework.
On the other hand, Andreas will cover the integration into build system tooling and KDE CI infrastructure: What is CTest doing? Which helper macros do exist in Extra-CMake-Modules? And what important information can be see on build.kde.org?
