um it was a short day for boss today

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,600
because we had the talks in the

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,520
afternoon

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,200
um so let's start off with room one

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120
which started with a party

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,600
and celebration because we had the

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,760
gitlab migration celebration

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,719
buchan dragged us through some of the

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,480
history and

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,480
lydia let us sing a song

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
if lydia hi

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,119
hi yes um we celebrated the migration to

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,439
gitlab

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,840
with the amazing team that's been

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,680
working on it

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,280
um like ben bushan

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,960
and nicolas and a ton of other people

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,280
and it was really cool to hear from

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,880
people um what they

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
thought about immigration and what they

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,159
had learned

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,119
and one of the things that we want to

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
highlight um from that is that with

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,360
gitlab

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,119
um in the future it will become much

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,840
easier for more people

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,119
to contribute to kde not just code and

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,159
it also will become

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,000
much easier for different types of

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,280
contributors to work together so for

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,360
example the primo team

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,280
is already really happy about github and

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,079
make it making it easier for them to

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,640
work on

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,640
websites

00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,799
and we danced and we danced

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,799
always important thanks lydia

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,880
moving on in room one there was a bit of

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,799
a break

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,119
and then we had the kde network

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,160
supporting local communities so that's

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,840
building out kde into

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
all the places in the world that are

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,840
coming to us virtually

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:25,040
anika hi

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,040
hi let me just turn on my camera

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,959
okay so we started off by briefly

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,800
explaining about what kde network is so

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,560
i will explain it again over here for

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,319
those who don't know about it

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,000
so it's basically a group of kde

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,200
representatives in their respective

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,040
cities and countries

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,560
who are going to promote kde in their

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,160
local community

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
and initially we are going to start a

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,360
pilot study in india to see if it works

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
out

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,840
and if it doesn't then we'll see what

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,400
are the other things which we can do

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,879
so the purpose of it is to basically

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,319
create

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,000
brand awareness of kde in that community

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,080
increase increase and engage new

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,959
contributors and increase the number of

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,400
end users in that community so we also

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,959
just uh discussed that

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,760
is it possible to have a legal entity or

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,280
not so

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,120
we discuss that it's going to just be a

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
supporting role if they want to do that

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,000
they can

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
go to board of members for that because

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,879
we are just going to support the local

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,840
communities

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,680
also uh we have uh financial plan and

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
the main plan ready so i'm going to

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,319
share

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,040
the links over here in the chat so if

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,879
anybody wants to go through it they can

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,120
also we have um telegram and metrics set

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,879
up

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,879
so if they want to join us because we're

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,080
going to have our next meeting

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,760
on 17 september so anybody who is

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
willing to support this idea should join

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,200
us

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
thanks anika and also thank you for all

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
of the

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,920
links in chat there we should remember

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,360
to save them

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,360
before clearing chat again

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:06,080
do that too okay moving on to room two

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,400
we started out with blue angel

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,720
sustainable computing in kde that was

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,280
run by cornelius so if cornelius

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:20,000
if you step in and explain to us

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,000
i don't see a cornelius in channel

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,840
but that's because i'm not looking well

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,560
is typing in the chat

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,840
well give him a minute

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,800
you should be able to rejoin the audio

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,800
by clicking the headphone button

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:02,240
okay so he's he's briefly stuck in

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,240
echo chamber hell

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,919
or at least in the you are now muted

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,120
stage

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,479
hi there we go hi

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,080
all right thank you again we had the

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,919
session about the blue angel

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,479
um which is this german

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,639
echo label so it's a label for

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,639
environmentally friendly products

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,639
they introduce the software label so we

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,400
talked about how to get

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,199
something from kde into that and get kde

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,560
certified

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,000
certified as the most sustainable

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,199
and energy efficient application

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,320
set um there's working on

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,800
on that it would be wonderful if some

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,440
people

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,919
join that measuring energy consumptions

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,960
or

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,080
of kde applications and also figuring

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,919
out how to

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,840
make sure that kd software is available

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,440
on computers which are old for a long

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,800
time so people don't have to buy new

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,160
hardware

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,880
and kd is in a great position

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,840
for getting this from a technical point

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080
of view but

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,560
and that's a very important point

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,479
because the label matches color wise

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,520
perfectly to kde

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,039
so i would love to get more of that i'm

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,639
working on that

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,720
other people are interested in that and

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,520
are working on that so

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,960
join us stay tuned we will announce more

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,440
on kde core devil

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,319
when there is more things in place to

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,319
join and collaborate

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,560
all right thank you cornelius that's

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,400
cool

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,400
um moving on

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,319
after blue angel we went to the kd

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
developer

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,840
platform developer documentation that

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,840
was run by carl

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,840
carl schwann

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,400
who has his hardware mute switch enabled

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,680
oh

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,880
okay yeah no no no it works

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,039
so we talked about the

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
developer platform what i'm currently

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,319
developing

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:12,479
i just said a link in the chat it's uh

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,800
um this i want to centralize

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,000
everything regarding the third party

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,840
usage of

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,800
kdp tools and frameworks

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,400
and we talked ab talking about the scope

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,440
of

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,199
his website and

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,840
how to organize it a bit and

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:39,360
what you want to apply to archive

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,720
uh yeah and let me

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,520
see in the notes we also talked

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,759
about the cremate documentation and or

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,199
we can move a bit forward to improve it

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,160
a bit

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:57,199
by for example moving the toxic qml

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,280
package in upstream in in

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:05,520
kde instead of it's enough github

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,520
okay that's it thanks

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:14,000
thank you carl moving on in room to

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,800

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,039
plenty of backup davids

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,560
