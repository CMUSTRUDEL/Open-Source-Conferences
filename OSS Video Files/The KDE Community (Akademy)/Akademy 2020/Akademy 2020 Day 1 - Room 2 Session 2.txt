	00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,160
c plus plus which was the thing back

00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,640
then also still on those

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,759
websites are appearing outside of cern

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,800
the first ones

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,719
and the gpl v2 is just released

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,400
so free software is something which is

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,279
actually still quite new

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,400
and then on the park bench in trondheim

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,480
norway

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,840
that's a story to a norwegian

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,000
programmers

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,840
who are working together on a database

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,840
and they need a ui for that

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,960
so they decide that maybe it would be

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,440
great to create

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,719
something like an object-oriented

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,559
display system

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,000
and they come up with the idea to create

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,200
a cross-platform

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,719
gui toolkit in c plus plus they call

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,000
that cute

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,920
they found a company

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,480
which then is named troy tech and in

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,760
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,480
they released the first version of qt q

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,160
0.9 and it looks like this beautiful

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,600
thing you know this example from the

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,920
documentation i think it probably is

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,559
still there somewhere

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,360
so this is 1995 and that's the story of

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,479
cute and one

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,320
one of the really innovative things um

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,040
um iraq and howard did is decided on

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,600
a dual licensing business model so they

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,680
had the acute profession which was their

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,880
commercial offering for all platforms

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
and all projects

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,520
including proprietary so that's where

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,159
they made money from

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,759
and innovative thing they did is they

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
decided on

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,000
releasing acute free edition as well and

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,560
their free edition license

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,840
for software projects which were free

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,079
software

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:47,360
so free projects using free square

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,360
on x11 i've got this edition for free

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,040
the other part of the story we have to

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,560
tell is the story of kde

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,280
so one year later in 1996 pcs are still

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
a thing

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,439
windows has actually grown is there unix

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,360
has something

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,640
called the common desktop environment

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,520
cde

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,800
quite an enterprise thing and linux is

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,520
also coming along

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
kernel 2.0 was just released and there

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
are a

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,480
number of linux distributions so the big

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,239
ones debian and red tattoos they are

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,319
already around at the time

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,080
and they are starting to becoming more

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,080
and more successful

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,480
but if you look at the state of the

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,560
graphical uses on linux

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:34,400
it's still quite sad this is how and

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,040
looked like not very convenient

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,920
very consistent uh quite difficult to

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,080
con

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,160
and certainly not made for ordinary

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,160
people but

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,440
who were using their command line tools

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,879
in this

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,000
window manager so this situation

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,400
obviously was something

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,840
would change and in 1996 in october i

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,360
met here

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,239
a german student mr

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,280
newsnet post and he asked for

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,080
programmers

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,400
wanted to join a project to crack create

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,040
an

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,440
actual user interface a graphical user

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,840
interface for users which was

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,159
for normal people not only the

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,360
developers

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,640
and in his first email he had actually

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,400
two firm decisions one was the stuff

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,200
will be distributed under the terms of

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
the gpl

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,280
so this was the start of the free

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,560
software project this was meant to be

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,000
to use the power of the many people who

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,720
are around

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
and the other decision is that this

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,480
should be based on

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,840
cute because he's acute as a very strong

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,319
technical foundation

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,640
to actually implement this somewhat

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,720
cleaner desktop how he calls it

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,239
and he also recognized georgetech's

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,000
business model and said yeah this kind

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
of marketing free source code for free

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,239
software that's something what i like

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,680
and this was actually the base which

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,720
actually made it possible to

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,959
develop kde on cute

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,959
so he asked for 20 30 programmers

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,280
to join and that happened and in 1997

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,519
there was the first kde presentation at

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
the linux congress in wurzburg

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,799
that was an actually quite high profile

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,639
event back then

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,560
so quite a number of prominent people

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,720
joined there ted so was there eric

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,720
raymond was there there conor was there

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,000
john maddock hall they all talked about

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,360
linux all kinds of things

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,479
alter kind of things free software and

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,360
also you had a strong present

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,919
so hobart was there talking about cute

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,919
um

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,240
caledonheimer who was one of the first

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,840
people joining matthias call and one of

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
the core developers

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,520
back then he had to talk about

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,639
programming on linux

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,520
and mathias himself he talked about kde

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,759
and showed the first screenshot of kde

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,320
at this stage so this is a screenshot on

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,720
of the

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,000
original proceedings of the congress

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,440
showing kde

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
a pre-release the current state back

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,840
then

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,440
and this also already looks quite

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,160
amazing

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
that was a huge success so the story

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
goes that this and uh there was another

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,639
project

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,639
um desktop project which had a

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
talk planned for after the kde

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
presentation and after they had seen

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,759
what kde presented there

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,680
they canceled the talk and left the

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,120
conference so okay

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
he had quite an impact there

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,479
proceedings what matthias wrote there so

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,199
sorry this is in german but that's the

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,720
original

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,680
and he basically said three things in

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,560
then this section so the first one is

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,400
cute is the only possible solution from

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,160
a technical point of view to actually be

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,800
able to implement that

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
so they checked different things and on

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,720
all these different widgets

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
around there lots of different things

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,039
but not very

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,840
well developed and quite different

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,160
so he saw the chance to some unification

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,280
there

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,400
and using cute as the technically

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,919
and he also hinted at a problem

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,759
kde had and that was cute's license

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,319
so critics said cute is not free

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,319
and what's interesting is to see how

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,360
matthias framed it so he put a

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,120
sentence there tonkin cheek um yeah we

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,080
created a mailing list for discussing

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,840
cute license

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,280
so the people who are doing the actual

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,479
work are not disturbed by these

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,880
discussions

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,520
but it was a big discussion and it

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,000
followed for a couple of time after that

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,639
and the big question there was how free

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,160
is free

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,880
so is k is cute actually free software

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,280
or not

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,319
and a lot of quite influential people

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,880
from the fsf

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,360
from red from the game team they argued

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
that

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,840
the acute free edition license doesn't

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,639
fulfill the requirements of free

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,400
software

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,680
so it wasn't the gpl but it was a

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,599
homegrown license

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,840
um and it had some conditions in there

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,319
which were not compatible with what the

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,120
gpl was doing so people argued qt is not

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,800
free enough

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,639
the intention of course was to make it

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,599
as free as as it's needed for free

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,240
software

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,240
but this was not accepted by everybody

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160
and the other big question was

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,199
what what happens if trial tech stops

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,680
developing huge what happens if

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,000
the toolkit is discontinued if the

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,479
company goes away what happens with that

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and the license didn't really allow

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,240
changing it and

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
further developing it so this was one of

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
the open questions the community had to

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,240
answer

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,240
and which led to quite a debate

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,240
and there was another threat um cali

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,479
dalhammer said that

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,000
you have to understand that in in the in

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,840
this time it was actually common that

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,440
companies would buy other companies just

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,360
to shut down projects

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,800
and one of the fears there was that

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,120
microsoft would

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,680
come and actually shut down cute in some

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,199
way so microsoft was in a situation back

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,720
then when it was really actively

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,160
fighting linux

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,039
so this was quite real and you can see

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,199
it um

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,800
this is a famous advertisement from a

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,560
german computer magazine

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,879
where microsoft actually said yeah if

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,840
you use linux you will get mutations you

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,840
don't have it under control

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,680
then later in 1997 um there was a

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,319
pivotal meeting in the history of kde

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,560
kde won the developer meeting in unspark

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,240
this was the first time all the kde

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
developers got together

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,199
and handbag is a small german town um

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,479
there is a manufacturer of wave makers

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,800
actually who was

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,919
using linux they had some linux fans and

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,399
they set up some

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,120
exterminators for the kdu developers to

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,440
work on

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,360
they invited them to onsbach so they had

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,839
the meeting there

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,959
and it came at a pretty delicate time

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,080
because two weeks

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,839
before this meeting gnome was founded as

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
an answer or reaction to the license

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,880
question

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,440
and so there was competition out there

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,720
and

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,080
trolltech sent iraq and aunt to germany

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,480
to join the meeting

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,760
and to work together with the kde people

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,120
and obviously also

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,720
to discuss the question of the license

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,360
and you have to realize that at that

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,880
time trolltech was just six employees

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,640
okay he had something like 200

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
developers working in kde

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,720
so the strategy of cute worked so they

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,320
they got this huge community adoption

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,200
they got this many people who actually

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,959
use cute

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,720
and on the other hand it also worked for

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,279
kde strong

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,480
uh tool kitting sheet so they had the

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,839
discussions about how

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,240
how do they deal with the license

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,320
question and uh trolltech

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,240
made a pretty bold offer there so they

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,240
said okay we want to have a contract

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,640
between the community and the company

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,399
which makes sure that cute stays free

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,640
for ever

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,440
so the kd people were a bit shocked by

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,839
that um

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,640
they didn't expect that much from from

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,480
that but

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,680
in in the end of course that was a

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,279
pretty good solution

00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,959
and they went ahead with that and then

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:03,600
later um in 1998 beginning of 1998

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,880
the statement of intent was signed by

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,760
the kde side

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,959
colored matthias and the acute side with

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,399
erika top

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,240
and they they laid down the two

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,760
main things there which the agreement

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,079
should

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,800
have and the one was to have this

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,200
foundation

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,000
which makes sure that the q3 edition is

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,959
available and

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,480
updated for free software development

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,800
and the second part that

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,959
if this is not happening if the company

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,120
is stopping the qt free edition

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,320
that it shall be released under the bsd

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
license

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,640
which would allow um a lot more liberal

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,079
things to do with the toolkit to

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,680
actually keep up things and we'll talk

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,760
about that later

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,720
so this was the agreement they had and

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,320
then

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,959
trolltech hired a prestigious norwegian

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
lawyer

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,959
and had to explain to them that they

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,560
actually wanted to give away something

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,320
for free and want to make sure that the

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
company doesn't have a chance to change

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,519
that

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,040
it was an interesting challenge but once

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,519
the lawyer understood that

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,320
they were ready to go and they wrote the

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,320
actual agreement

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:16,480
so how does it work the thing is that

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,959
at this time there wasn't a legal entity

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
on behalf of kve so the first thing

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,160
which

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,120
was happening was that kdev was founded

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,120
this happened at the end of 1997

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,120
and uh trojan we created together this

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,560
foundation which is called the kde for

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,160
cube foundation

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,560
the reason to do that in a separate

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,760
foundation was that

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,920
in the case trial tech would go bankrupt

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,959
then it would get hard to get access to

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,680
the assets of

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,839
trolltech and of course the the software

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,920
queue the licenses would be an asset

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,680
so they said okay we put that into an

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
independent foundation so that is

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,040
something which

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,600
can't be taken away and the license

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,600
agreement which strategic gives to the

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,880
kde frequent foundation gives the

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,639
guarantee that the

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,639
kde frequent foundation can then

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,600
actually do what is necessary to keep

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,519
cube free and the foundation is actually

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,120
a very small thing it only consists of

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,920
two representatives of

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,120
both sides and they built the board of

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,079
the foundation which

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,440
takes the decision and there's a twist

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,560
there because kde

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,600
has a majority in case of ties so

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,600
if there is a two to two voting

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,920
then kde decides about the result which

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,040
gives kde the leverage to actually

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,880
keep the license free

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,880
of qt in case something happens

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,560
and the primary uh tool to do that

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,120
is that um the license agreement says

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,959
if no major updates of qt of the q3

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,120
edition happen

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
five months then the foundation can

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,880
release

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,320
the acute free edition under the bsd

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,720
license

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,040
and the consequences of that are it

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
protects qt against bankruptcy takeover

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,560
and change of plans

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,079
because under the bsd license you

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,560
actually have

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,320
the permission to use it for all kind of

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,440
projects open source as well as

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,639
proprietary

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,839
so that's a very liberal license and it

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,200
also allows

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,639
to build again a new company with a

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,399
similar dual licensing

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,480
business model that's something which

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,079
you can do with a bsd license you

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,000
can incorporate into proprietary

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:34,160
offerings but

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:37,200
this wouldn't be possible with the gpa

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,480
so then in 1998 the agreement finally is

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
signed in june

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,560
um there's an announcement and this has

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,480
a nice statement in it it says

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,760
we believe the founding of the kde

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,079
frequent foundation

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,480
to be an unprecedented groundbreaking

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,519
step ushering in a new era of software

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,440
development

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,800
allowing the kde project the free

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,040
software community

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,959
all three software developers as well as

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,040
commercial software developers

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,000
to prosper in a mutually supportive

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,839
fashion

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
quite a bold statement i think it

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,040
reflects the mindset of kde and cute at

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,560
that time

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,480
but it's actually quite powerful and has

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,760
carried on the project and the

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,760
foundation over the years

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,320
this is the actual agreement which was

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,320
science three pages

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,279
and then a few weeks later kde 1.0 was

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,040
released

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,399
based on queued 1.2 and it looked like

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,399
this

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,399
this is still not the beautiful desktop

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,839
it's a great start and the project

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,839
really a lot of momentum

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,839
and it evolved and over the time also

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,160
the license of qt evolved

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,079
traject added the qpl after some time

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,240
which then was actually accepted as an

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,320
open source license

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,760
later they changed it to the gpl and

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639
this was the point in time which

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,320
actually ended

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,440
all the discussions about if cute is

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,839
free software or not kde also involved

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,639
evolved had major updates and the

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,160
agreement in 2004 was updated as well to

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,360
reflect the change

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,399
licensing also in the in the releases of

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,839
qt and how

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,680
kde used it

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,079
also added under the gpl

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,880
in qt4 but at that time it wasn't

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,880
covered by the agreement yet

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,240
one of the challenges there with the

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,959
okay with the agreement

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,160
is that the question what is the q3

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,240
edition actually is

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,279
the crucial question of of the whole

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,680
agreement so

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,199
what actually means this continued what

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,680
means major update

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,560
what is part of cued what do you do with

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,240
duplicated modules and stuff like that

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,160
also what platforms are covered by the

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,680
agreement um at the

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,199
writing of the agreement for example

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,959
embedded platforms

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,720
weren't around so nobody thought about

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,880
that what about windows what about

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,399
mobile phones and stuff like that also

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,880
what licenses are acceptable

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,440
what happens with with the gpa version 3

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,399
which

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,160
was relevant at some point so this is

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,800
the crucial thing which

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,720
always needed some discussion and debate

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,120
and continues working on the agreement

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,320
to adapt it to the current

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,279
state and then

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,360
uh with the discussions which are what

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,920
were happening in the kdp foundation

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,680
this actually was quite helpful to

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,199
create this balance to balance the

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,759
interest between the community and the

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,240
company

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,360
the foundation gave this platform to

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,880
actually have these discussions

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,240
then in 2008 there was

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,600
an email to kdev by the troll tech

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,399
management

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,000
and it said yeah trolltech is acquired

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,519
by nokia

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,360
so this was the moment where the

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,759
agreement was put to test

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,880
this was what the agreement was designed

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,160
for

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,160
and people were actually

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,759
interested what was happening there um

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,759
we were quite aware that

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,759
this would be an interesting situation

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
but in this case nokia actually went

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,959
with that in a very

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,679
responsive way so they contacted us very

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,959
early

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,480
um kde was at the table um

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,039
we had meetings with the nokia

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,720
management in frankfurt um that wasn't

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,439
fun with where the nokia managers

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,959
visited us in our then very small office

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,520
with half an employee

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,000
shared with the wikimedia foundation um

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,240
and

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,120
we had about qt and kde there

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,520
and then we had the invitation back to

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,520
the nokia headquarter in helsinki

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,640
which was of course quite a contrast but

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,320
the great thing was

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,000
we discussed these things on eye level

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,799
because it was clear that

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the agreement was in place and it would

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,240
stay in place

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,679
and that we would have to talk about how

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,880
we do the best

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,280
with that for the communities

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,520
nokia also added the lgpl and there was

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,400
a third agreement to reflect the changes

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,880
and qt5 then was developed under open

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,000
governance when nokia opened queued to

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,880
actually contributions of more people

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,559
they were quite ambitious um sebastian

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,760
nusram who was running

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,559
the cute part of nokia at that time he

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,840
said in the keynote on the q dev days in

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,520
2009 that

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,520
they wanted to increase the reach of you

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,520
tenfold and that's something clearly you

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,520
can't do without the community outreach

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,760
so over the years more evolution um

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,240
nokia of course changed plans

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,200
um that's a different story digi

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,840
acquired cued

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,000
um q5 was released and there was a

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,280
fourth agreement reflecting the changes

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,160
then the q company was informed and

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,400
eventually

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,679
went public another agreement reflected

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,280
the changes there

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,360
that's basically the state where we are

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,880
today um

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,640
we have this agreement in place we are

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,120
in constructive discussions with the q

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,120
company

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,160
there's one twist in the story which is

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,200
interesting um the agreement also was

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,480
built to prevent

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,559
selling qt to microsoft microsoft

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,600
actually acquired most part of nokia

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,720
in 2013 and

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,440
this this is uh where acute already was

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,480
in the handhelds of digia so also there

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,120
the agreement

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,919
worked what's the end of the story

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,400
well uh we can say mission accomplished

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,000
cute

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,799
state free acute state free

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,400
across multiple acquisitions um and

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,280
that's what the agreement was

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880
was meant to do so this worked but of

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,559
course this is not the end of the story

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,880
because cute are still there and kde is

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,600
still there and they have a

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,039
hopeful glory for the future um so the

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,760
agreement will

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,280
be there and serve this purpose but

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,799
there are a couple of things

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,799
which can be learned from it and

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,120
one is that this was really a solid

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,760
thing um it

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,880
served for more than 20 years he was

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,320
state-free

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,840
and kde and cube both had quite

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,480
quite good success and impact so

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,240
this certainly was a good foundation and

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,760
it worked in two ways

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,600
one was that the license guaranteed

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,120
the present freedom so once you had the

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,799
code under the gpl

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,320
of qt and kd of course you could do

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,320
whatever you want with that under the

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,960
conditions of the license

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,760
but only with the q the code you already

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,919
had

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,080
the foundation guaranteed also something

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,400
about the future of freedom

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,559
so that the code would be developed in

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,360
an open and free way in the future as

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,880
well

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,120
and through the foundation you had this

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,559
mechanism to foster a dialogue and this

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,960
balancing between community and

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,840
commercial interests

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,559
so quite quite a strong setup which

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,320
actually

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,400
keeps things free one question is

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,240
sometimes asked what about the fork um

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,159
if i have the code under the gpa

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,280
i can just just fork it why do i need

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,840
the agreement

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,200
that's true but it would split the

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,880
community

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,120
and it also wouldn't allow that your

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,520
license business model on the fork

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,919
so the most sustainable version is to

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,840
not fork but work under the agreement

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,840
and work under the current situation

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,080
the other question which was asked

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,080
sometimes is is this a model for other

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,840
projects as well so could you use that

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,000
in other projects

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,039
and the answer is there is a certain

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,200
type of projects

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,799
where this might actually be a good fit

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,480
so the typical use case would be

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,919
something like a single vendor project

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,440
where you have one company controlling

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,760
an open source project

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,640
and they are following some new business

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,039
model

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,000
and for that to work they need a cla

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,919
which gives them the

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,080
rights to also release a proprietary

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,520
version and the problem there is that

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,919
this is an asymmetric

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,760
setup so the company has more rights

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,840
than the community has

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,440
and that of course can be a demotivation

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,600
for people to actually participate in

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,480
this project

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,080
the kd3q foundation style setup is a way

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,840
to balance this

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,679
so that there you add something on the

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,679
other side where the community gets a

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,840
say in the future of the project

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,919
and gives some security about the

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,840
freedom of the project for the future

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,760
and this is a way to motivate actually

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,840
people to contribute because they know

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,600
it's not only the company profiting from

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,320
from that but they also give something

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,400
back and they

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,159
are obliged to actually do that that's

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,400
what the kd frequent foundation

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,400
does

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,080
one thing to be aware of is that this is

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,440
a complex thing um the agreement is now

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,600
14 pages not three pages any most of

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
that is about the question what actually

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,320
forms

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,080
cute how's how has less developed what

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,720
what do we have to take into account for

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,640
that

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
but that's actually the thing you need

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,720
to do and that's the result of these

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,520
fruitful discussions about

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,200
how free do we do it how is the balance

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,159
between that and how can we balance the

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,280
interest in a

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,200
mutually beneficial way

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,799
and the other thing which also is i

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,120
think quite important

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,520
it takes courage to do that so it takes

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,640
this courage of the original founders of

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,120
trolltech

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,360
which said we give it away for free and

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,600
this is an important thing because

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,159
i didn't know if it would work but it

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,159
actually did

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,880
so the kde frequent foundation what's

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,280
the art of it

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,720
it's the freedom it's a freedom which is

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,600
also a strong value

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,799
we have in kde which is driving our work

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,600
and we do that

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,520
because freedom is good for business

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,720
freedom is good for community

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,240
and freedom is good for the world and i

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,279
want to close with

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,400

[Music]

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,120
all right so this is going to be a bit

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,480
of

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,880
a weird presentation for me because

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,919
it's kind of a bit outside of my comfort

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,360
zone but on the other hand it's

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,480
something that i've

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,880
uh missed in what we do for a while

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,080
so what i want you to get from this

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,360
presentation is a little bit of

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,240
ideas or inspiration

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,440
on how you could uh focus your work into

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,200
making sure

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,399
that we are um caring and

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,120
doing the most for out of our work

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,600
overall uh first of all let me present

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,600
myself

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:58,080
anything you see something

00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:02,000
well i guess that my presentation slide

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:05,600
is gone uh so let me just explain it

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,720
um my name is alesh i

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,039
am a kpo developer i have been for over

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,080
a decade right now i'm also the kdp

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,480
president uh as i was introduced as well

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,120
uh i'm employed by blue systems doing

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,640
software

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,720
uh work uh on kd and i am based in

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,919
barcelona in the lovely mediterranean

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,480
coast

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:32,480
now um what i wanted to reflect on today

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,120
is that we're all consumer of things we

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,080
are all very used to by using consumer

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,720
products it's

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,919
what economy has been about in over the

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,760
last century

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,880
and well it has its upsides and

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,360
they are kind of all

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,799
geared towards of being able to use

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,039
things and use them easily

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,799
and i think that this is something very

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,440
directly related to what we do

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,080
what we do as kde which is create things

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,000
so that

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,840
uh specifically software pieces of

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,720
software so that people can

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,519
can enjoy them and and use them as tools

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,840
right

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,559
not unlike other software products not

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,159
unlike

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:16,480
um i don't know a bag of chips right

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:18,880
uh when you need uh to be able to

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,240
get emails you will get k-mail when you

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,360
need to get

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,760
uh carbohydrates you will

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,840
buy pasta right so

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,360
we all familiarize with the concept of

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,360
product and

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,279
in the end it's a lot of what we create

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,880
we create products for people to

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,440
well check their emails and a bunch of

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,840
stuff now

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,440
i think that it would be interesting for

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:48,399
for a second to

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,399
take a step back and think about how

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,559
a consumer somebody who's used to buying

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,919
bag of chips and someone who's

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,240
used to buying cars and tvs

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,200
well they're gonna consume our software

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,640
right

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:06,320
because uh while many

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,960
people use it uh thousands and

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,840
some people say millions uh use our

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,919
software

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:17,679
um well we we have all wonder why

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:20,960
it isn't billions and in the end

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,519
part of our task is to make it easy

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,640
not just to have our products used but

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,080
to make sure that

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,799
uh everybody can reach uh

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,320
technology hardware computation internet

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,519
etc right

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:38,880
so that's what

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,640
uh i would like to discuss and

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
since i didn't really know how to have

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,279
this conversation i reached

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,720
out to my university uh notes

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,399
where they talked about something that

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,919
is called the marketing mix

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:54,399
uh something that uh economists like

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,399
allowed to do is to

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,960
have acronyms for things so these are

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,720
the four ps of the marketing mix

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,399
which i'm gonna talk about and then i

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,799
would like to see how they match

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,399
what what we're doing in in kde and

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,919
actually i think that a lot of

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,480
it would uh also apply to any influence

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,519
of our project it's not like we're doing

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,600
all that worse than the rest it's uh i

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,480
really care about kde

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,399
now first of all we need to we have the

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,519
product we need to define it

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,000
when we talk about um

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,039
a bag of chips it's not only like the

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,880
potatoes right

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,880
it's the potatoes processed in a very

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,679
specific way so that it's easy for you

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,480
to consume

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,039
not unlike our our software products

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,840
right

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,840
when we talk about why is um

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,440
gig important for example kig is a

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,240
geometry application for educational

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,440
students

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,720
well it is important not because people

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,919
don't have other ways to draw circles

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,039
and lines right

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,000
it's because we create a product that

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,480
has been thought

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,600
from the start so that people can can

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,799
learn can

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,799
uh do their geometry work over

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,440
over that piece of software much like

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,119
plasma for example as well

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,119
right plasmas

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,480
idea is to acknowledge that people will

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,240
want to have a computer some software

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,679
and they will want to make the the best

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,000
out of it and

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,839
what we try to simplify it by providing

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,839
a graphical user interface but a lot

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,200
more stuff right we have all of the

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,000
services around it

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,040
everything is geared towards creating

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,240
this one product

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,240
that should satisfy whoever consumes it

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,480
and while we all know that plasma feeds

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,359
in the whole community

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,240
in a well much more complex light we are

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,520
all

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,320
aware about how all of uh while linux

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,599
works

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,920
we're still something that people are

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,800
perceived directly right

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,680
while we are part of the big thing

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,240
people expect

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,680
us to be delivering it as a product and

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,880
actually be as good

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,640
as it is uh

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,320
from when they buy it from something

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,599
more commercial that

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,040
would be like i said a pack of chips if

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,240
a pack of chips when you're eating

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,280
explodes on your face

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,520
you'll be angry and you will start

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,520
well

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,400
insulting people something similar

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,440
happens

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,599
when the software explodes now

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,760
second aspects the second p would be

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,079
price so

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,000
we're used that when we buy something we

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,240
get uh

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,359
we have to pay some money in exchange

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,040
price goes much

00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,720
beyond that actually something that we

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,680
have seen on the internet yeah something

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,200
uh worth

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,440
noting is that this marketing makes is

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,440
something from the 70s or 80s

00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,160
well from before the internet um

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,000
but while they still apply it might be a

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,599
bit outdated in this regard

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,359
uh google without going much further

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,200
have shown us how

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,119
uh money is not the only price that you

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,520
can pay when you're using

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,240
a product you can pay with your data for

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,079
example

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,880
facebook actually it's been what the

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,640
internet has been about over the last

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:25,920
10 to 20 years at least right

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,400
but there are other prices as well uh

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,680
there is

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,720
uh money there is security there is uh

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,960
privacy uh it can also be

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,839
that you have to go through hoops

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,960
installing

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,640
arch linux and then

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,040
all of that right and i think that at

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,040
the moment the price of using

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,880
well what what we create is going

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,480
a bit along these lines that's my

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,760
opinion for sure

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,480
um we have uh a place

00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,280
now when we buy the pack of chips the

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,920
place would be the supermarket right

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,680
when we talk about google services it's

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,200
probably google.com or

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,760
gmail or whatever i don't really know

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,760
for us what is it and actually uh if you

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,040
saw the kitty all about the apps talk if

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,920
you saw the weyland talk

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,320
i think that um there is a lot of effort

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,240
that we're putting not just kde but

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,079
overall in the linux community and free

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,599
software community

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,760
to make this

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,760
place more defined and actually much

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,240
easier to reach because it has been

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,839
like i said earlier and also in my

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,359
opinion a bit complex

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,320
um especially given uh

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,280
the the premise has been in a lot of

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,560
cases

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,880
downloading weird things from websites

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,560
buying a com a computer with an

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,800
operating system and swapping it for

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,599
another one that is not really supported

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,880
this is a weird place to go to right

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,240
nevertheless it's there

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,520
it's working i am sure that out of the

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,800
70 many people who are in this room

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,520
a lot of us have done it

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,320
so it's not that bad and many of us

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,040
we're still

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,880
also uh we're working on the

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,520
alternatives right for example the

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,320
kd slim book is also another way of

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,160
looking at that problem

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,200
the app stores are as well etc

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,720
and the last p is promotion now

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,320
we have a place we need to make sure

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,880
that people go into this place how to

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,079
make sure that this happens

00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,800
for example we have uh the dots we have

00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,119
uh planet we have the talks that we go

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,960
to conferences and talk about what we do

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,960
uh we have the community the linux user

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,079
groups that are in every city and they

00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,520
talk to their peers

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,200
and explain when our software would be

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,200
good for them

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,680
all of these are small pieces into this

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,680
promotion

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,640
machine that

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,839
that we are part of in the end podcasts

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,079
uh you we've all seen also like

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,760
these street signs for some projects i

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,760
remember seeing one from firefox uh

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,800
10 years ago or so and i felt like it

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,960
was weird like

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,839
these logos are supposed to be only in

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,200
my laptop

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:24,320
but it wasn't the case anymore um

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,560
there's many ways of doing this

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,599
writing books documentation can be also

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,040
part of promotion

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,960
it's also part of the product as well

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,320
everything is kind of connected and

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,320
works with with each other

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,359
now

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,240
i've presented these four things i'm

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,280
gonna try i'm gonna do the

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,400
my best effort into uh analyzing how

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,280
uh some of our software feeds in this

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,720
consumer

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,680
consumer-centric centric world and

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,839
and maybe we can see like not today i'm

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,880
not gonna tell you what to do right now

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,520
but we can see new ways where we can

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,200
work further like i said not like we're

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,000
doing something

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,640
terrible but we need to look into the

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,640
future right

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:19,040
something that uh brings

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,079
like writes my red light every time that

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,599
i see

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,079
is when i see maintainers developers

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,720
that don't

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,359
really take response responsibility of

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,960
the

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,520
delivery process this has admittedly not

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,720
been

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,200
um very easy to do

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,480
up until recently but technology has

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,720
evolved a lot

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,720
and

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,440
our infrastructure is also so much

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,280
better uh so that we can

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,520
start thinking about those things um

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,680
and someone who clearly has done this

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,040
very well is krita for example

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,640
now what do i mean by taking

00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,319
responsibility of the creative to

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,960
deliver a process

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,560
well we have some people thinking about

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,520
how to create software what it's going

00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,720
to look like

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,760
what it's going to feel like to the to

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,359
the user

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,480
um we need these people to be involved

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,960
into the well for one the

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,880
feedback that comes back from the user

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,400
uh to make sure that they can

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,319
um react when

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,079
something doesn't work like it should we

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,839
don't have to we cannot assume that

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,680
we're going to do everything perfect

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:36,079
because in in this life nothing is

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,079
and so is in our software so

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,880
as part of of this iteration uh process

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,560
we need to make sure that

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,400
the the people who are responsible in

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,880
the beginning can also be responsible in

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,880
the end

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,319
something that has frustrated me and i'm

00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,319
gonna give you an example

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:56,480
it was uh i think it was maybe

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:59,520
10 years ago when we were part of the

00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,520
brazilian education

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,240
deployment we had a lot of people using

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,280
kde software over there

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,319
um some

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,040
were still scary edu apps some others

00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,160
were

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,640
plasma but in the end what really

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,160
shocked me is that while we were having

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,400
like hundreds of millions of people

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:24,000
using the the software

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,280
the amount of feedback we got was still

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,920
quite minimal right uh and how was this

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,200
possible

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,240
well uh when talking to the organizers

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,240
of the deployment

00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,079
they started to tell me about all of

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,800
these infrastructure that they had

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,079
to to get the feedback from the teachers

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,319
because

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,760
good reasons actually right like their

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,040
english wasn't that good

00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,000
or they didn't feel like they were

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,319
technically

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,079
capable of of communicating with us

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,480
these are all things that we should make

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,880
sure

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,800
that stops being a problem over time if

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,880
we want to make sure

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,400
that if you want to be able to continue

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,520
saying that we care about users that we

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,640
care about

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,839
what people are doing and that we can

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,839
offer solutions for that

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,079
and the another very good example about

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,920
that

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,800
is kdconnect where uh it has two sides

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,520
it has the

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,400
linux cute side and then it has the

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,560
android side

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,520
and when discussing the development

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,319
feature

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,760
the linux site always needs to be super

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,800
backwards compatible because

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:38,720
people who use deviant will stay on an

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:42,480
old unmaintained version for many years

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,560
when android people will get an update

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,079
automatically from android or google

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,720
play with the last version

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,480
which is the thing that has been curated

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,480
by the maintainers

00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,560
at any point so

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,880
it's really awkward that we have a

00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:03,119
better uh

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,599
communication with our users on on on

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,760
on android and especially on google play

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,280
than it is on actually the platforms

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,760
that we're comfortable with using and

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,240
actually we're telling people to use

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,800
i know that there's uh ways to improve

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,839
that

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,839
and many of us are working towards that

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,200
but i think that it would be very

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,480
important to make sure

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,280
that we keep these as

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,720
as an angle rather than that thing that

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,839
is happening

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,720
in parallel with my daily life because

00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,640
in the end

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,640
if somebody has a problem they tell you

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,680
and you cannot well you can solve the

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,800
problem

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,280
but uh that person won't ever get the

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,200
the the fix or they will get the fix

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,839
eventually

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,599
there is a lot of uh frustration that

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,359
gets unresolved we need to make sure

00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,280
that

00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,440
frustration is not part of our daily

00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,520
lives now

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,119
uh we need to make sure that we get to

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,359
do this as a team

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:08,720
you have a lot of people you can rely on

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:11,680
and but use them

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,480
talk to us talk to everyone and let's

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,480
make sure that

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,200
the issues get resolved and that you can

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:24,240
do what you

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,000
that you want now when thinking about

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,079
the kind of products we have we have

00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,079
uh apps we have systems much like plasma

00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,760
actually mostly plasma

00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,680
and we have frameworks

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,040
which are kind of a weird product in

00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,680
itself but actually it's a good

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,160
explanation of what we're talking about

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,200
uh an example of an app k2 building i

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,240
was talking about gig

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:52,240
earlier but uh

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,319
what is our our price the first pay

00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,920
well the price of your tuber link is

00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:00,480
mostly zero

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,119
euros and possibly or you could do in a

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,200
donation

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,280
that's kind of part of it you could hire

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,680
somebody if it's not doing somebody

00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,640
something that you would like it to do

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,760
uh

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:15,200
that's kind of it uh oh sorry

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,520
i was not the first piece still

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,520
uh

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,040
oh sorry i forgot the first p was this

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,680
product what is the product

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,119
product is the app itself with the

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,760
whatever features it has

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,920
at the right moment the place well the

00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,119
place actually it will depend a lot on

00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,800
the platform you're on

00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:39,680
if you're in android

00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,040
it will be either android or google play

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,440
i actually think that

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,880
ktuberling is in google play or at least

00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,880
it was some sometime in the past

00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,200
if you're on windows it should be the

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,680
windows store probably or downloading

00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,000
msi files i don't know i don't really

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,240
use windows at all but if i was

00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,839
uh okay turbulent maintainer i would

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,119
have to get involved in that if i want

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,359
my windows users to be to be happy

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,720
and that's a good if right you you can

00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,599
decide that you don't care about

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,040
something

00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,280
but then you need to be conscious about

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,720
that you cannot say

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,319
i'm gonna hope that somebody packages my

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,599
application and hope for the best

00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,880
because it should work and actually

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,920
probably will just work

00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,920
but you need to know where your

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,359
application is being used that and then

00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,559
on linux at the moment

00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:29,520
but the answer is very very

00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,760
diverse on debian will be apt or

00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,640
probably also flat packs like snap

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,119
but snap should work somewhat on

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,119
everywhere

00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,319
well it depends also it's important to

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,119
remember that we need to

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,599
to focus on those because we cannot have

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,240
every

00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,680
maintainer supporting everything ever

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,440
right

00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,880
and then last would be promotion which

00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,480
would be all the planet

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,359
everyone remember the planet is super

00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,280
important whatever you say there

00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:04,480
which is a lot of people use it

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,119
now i hear i have just one minute

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,000
i'm gonna go through plasma very quickly

00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,720
or

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,119
actually i'm not i am going to leave you

00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,440
uh

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,800
the the task of of doing it yourself you

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,280
can do the process i think that it's

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,400
it's an

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,680
interesting um

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:25,200
thought uh process to to do and

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,200
you will learn from it

00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,040
use the team you don't need to work

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,720
alone actually if you're working

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,440
alone it's probably because you're doing

00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,359
something wrong don't do it

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,520
spread your work there's people who will

00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,880
be interested in some parts specifically

00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,960
use that for for your uh

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,559
in your advantage do not blame if

00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,119
something is not working especially

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,720
since you control the process

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,400
it's something that you can fix we are

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,240
relying only on free software

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,680
and as a team we should be able to solve

00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,280
any of the problems if something is not

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,280
working on cute it's not

00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,960
acceptable to tell a user this is not

00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,400
working on cute if something is not

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,119
working on cube you send the parts to

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,200
cute

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,119
and enjoy your life and when i'm talking

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,240
about cube it can be any part of our

00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,960
stack frameworks

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,680
it can be linux it can be whatever all

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,720
right

00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,960
and thank you sorry for being a bit over

00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,960
time

00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,079
thank you alesh you're almost perfectly

00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,400
in time we still have four minutes left

00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,680
or for questions

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,000
and if we look into the shared notes

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,520
there's

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,359
actually four questions so uh we have

00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,160
one minute each

00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,720
um the first one is uh what do you think

00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,559
about

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,880
lenovo or dell selling linux laptops

00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,400
i think it's great it's something

00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,599
actually i think that it should be the

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,200
right place for

00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,040
for plasma um at the moment though

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,480
plasma is not available over there

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,359
something that

00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,720
should be worked on i guess and actually

00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,960
the whole conversation about

00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,960
how that should happen would be really

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,480
interesting it's not straightforward but

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,480
i think that we should strive

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,240
to go in this direction doesn't need to

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,559
be the big manufacturers either

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,760
i think that the important thing is to

00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,079
have something

00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:18,480
that we can tell people to use right um

00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,119
slim book has been a good first uh case

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,880
for that

00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:26,240
there might be others there are others

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,880
um the second question

00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,079
is uh what do you think about the teddy

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,720
bears

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:36,800
uh something like getting uh normal

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,800
users from twitter to mastodon

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,160
i don't really have a strong opinion i

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,680
have to i try to be part of

00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,440
of every of these networks because i

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,400
think that it's the right place to be on

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,599
they admittedly cannot really put all of

00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,280
my effort over there

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,839
because what i care about is actually

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,720
people using free software people about

00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:00,559
using our software enjoying our software

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,079
and i am not going to put myself in the

00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,599
position of going somewhere

00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:08,800
where people are not around um

00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,599
ask kdu though if we if

00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,520
you care about the federals i would

00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,839
encourage you to join the kitty promo

00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,640
group

00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,280
i am sure that they will embrace you

00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,160
with a

00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:24,079
smile and let you do what you care about

00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,359
okay then the next question is a bit

00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,960
longer um

00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:28,720
something that has worked for other

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,839
communities to improve their product

00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,880
focus

00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:35,520
um is to get their is to get

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,559
to know their users by survey surveying

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,000
them

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,160
with simple questions to guide

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,640
prioritization

00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,720
as a free software community we can ask

00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,079
of our users input better than

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:51,520
a bug tracker already those tools fail

00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:53,760
to quantify the tendencies i feel asking

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,720
what is working for you where is your

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,280
software

00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,240
letting you down et cetera could guide

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,040
us

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,800
do you think that could help us i think

00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,839
that it's it's super important actually

00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,800
earlier this year we worked actually

00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,280
with volker

00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,000
who's uh sharing key user feedback which

00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,119
is actually

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,400
all about that we haven't really used

00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,440
all of the potential

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,760
and actually the polling uh

00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,559
thing you're asking about is actually

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,520
part of it

00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,000
when when we do it we will do our best

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,160
to

00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,599
ask the right questions i think that

00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,119
it's it's very important especially

00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,720
because we don't want to

00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,920
only work for the people who are having

00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,839
problems i think that it's very

00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,319
important to know what

00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:38,319
makes people happy about what we do and

00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:42,079
not have this bias of

00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:45,280
whatever is not working is what

00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,559
is important because it's not always the

00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,160
case and we might be losing

00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,640
opportunities over there

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:53,040
but also again if you're interested in

00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,240
working on that

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,880
join us and say this is gonna be my my

00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,880
turf right

00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,960
okay then the last question still fits

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,359
in um

00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,079
how do you see neon fitting into the

00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,640
idea of

00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,839
kde taking more responsibility for

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,319
connecting directly with users

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,359
i think that a neon has already done a

00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,160
lot in this

00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:20,079
in this direction i remember telling

00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:23,200
years ago

00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,040
jonathan and harold about how

00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,040
i was getting a lot more feedback on

00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,240
discover which is some software that i

00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,559
have been working on since long time uh

00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,079
from from neon that i was getting from

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,760
any of the other distros

00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,160
and actually at that moment neon was

00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,599
just starting right so people

00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,880
were not uh well there weren't that many

00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:47,760
people back then

00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,760
as they are right now using neon um

00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,319
there could be more i guess the linux

00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,119
ecosystem is a very complex i am not

00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,960
going to

00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,319
be telling people what it should look

00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,400
like i know what i want

00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,079
and i think that if you've listened to

00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,480
me you will

00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,160
kind of get an idea i don't think that

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,960
actually neon is

00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,880
the end goal uh but i think that it's

00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,359
definitely a very interesting tool

00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,440
right now if i want to tell people i

00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,000
need you to test this feature on

00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,640
on on plasma i think that it's probably

00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,040
one of the

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,200
best ways to do so but there are others

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:28,880
there's uh open source tumbleweed

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:32,160
it's also an interesting uh way to do it

00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,000
and i'm sure there are many others as

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:38,240
well

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,520
um i think uh uh our time is up um

00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,799
thank you again alesh for that

00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:45,440
presentation um we'll now have a

00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,720
four minute break um and then we'll

00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:53,839
continue with uh

00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:53,839
with yuan

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:37,040
okay then let's welcome johan

00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:40,880
for the next presentation um john is

00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:43,040
going to tell us about linux and cars

00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,040
yeah so hi everyone thanks for having me

00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:47,520
i'm i'm actually joining from a car

00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:51,680
so i just want to double check is the is

00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:54,079
the audio okay volker

00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,119
yeah your audio is perfect ah sounds

00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,079
great yeah

00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:00,000
so last weekend in the summer house a

00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,880
slight change of location really late

00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,319
before so praying to the lte gods but uh

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,280
yeah it will be fine so hi

00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,880
uh i'm yuwan uh i actually work for for

00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,640
ambition one of our sponsors

00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,160
uh i also run a company on the side

00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,040
called code rice

00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,319
i run a conference called foss north in

00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:21,280
sweden that

00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:23,119
some people might recognize free from

00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,920
i've been doing lots of cute embedded

00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,599
linux and

00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,240
and with the focus on automotive in the

00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,000
past decade uh i also tinkered with

00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:33,359
licensing and so on

00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,280
so um yeah

00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:37,520
uh i just want to say before starting

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,559
here that all opinions are my own

00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,599
uh i i agreed to do talking here before

00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,960
my uh my

00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:48,960
employer decided to sponsor so

00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,960
so these are my own personal views

00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,880
uh but yeah look before we dive into the

00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,760
whole

00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,599
uh problem space let's have a look at

00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,200
how does an infotainment system look

00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,480
today

00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:05,440
um and this is a blurred picture

01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,160
of the uh of the architecture from

01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,079
genevieve

01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,079
which is a standardization organization

01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:14,079
that works with open source solutions

01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,640
around this and and i can just overlaid

01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,680
it

01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,599
with these boxes where we see that we at

01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,160
the very top we have apps

01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,079
and these are of course vendor specific

01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,559
to a large extent to to sort of make it

01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:29,200
car specific and get that

01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:31,200
brand feeling and then you have a huge

01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,680
number of services this might be

01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,640
anything from workshop production

01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,400
telephony

01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,319
media playback whatnot everything that

01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,839
goes into your car

01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:41,599
all the services that you need and then

01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,319
you have a base platform at the very

01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,559
base

01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,240
bottom which is a classical embedded

01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,240
linux system

01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,680
and and if we look at this and see where

01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,599
do we have open source

01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,400
we we do have open source in in the base

01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:58,079
platform we do have linux

01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,760
some of these services are largely based

01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,640
around open source

01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,160
two various degrees and some at the very

01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,359
top the the brighter

01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,200
colored ones there is actually no

01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,000
intention to make them open source

01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,839
because that's where

01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,920
sort of the brand differentiation comes

01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:15,839
in so so then it's more up to the

01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,240
automaker too to make that open source

01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:20,880
rather than to to the community

01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,760
um i actually like to color this picture

01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,079
this way

01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,240
so what is not open source we we have

01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,440
lots and lots of red boxes in here

01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,440
that would be good to address

01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:36,799
and and why is this um so my

01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,319
takeaway from this is that you you have

01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:40,720
requirements that are only

01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:42,400
piled on project from project you copy

01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,240
the last requirement setting you add

01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,040
some more you copy the last

01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,559
project again and add some more and

01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,920
sometimes you can really tell that this

01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,200
requirement is actually a functional

01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,119
requirement and this one

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,720
is a supplier that cocked up so they

01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,720
need to clarify something because last

01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,520
time they had a fight over it

01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,440
and and when you start like this from a

01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,359
very strict requirement set

01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,799
of course open source components doesn't

01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,400
fit one to one

01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,240
you need someone who steps in between

01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,319
and make adaptations or

01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,000
let's call it integration work that

01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,680
leverages the open source components

01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,039
into building something that fulfills

01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,720
the requirements

01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:20,160
and and that's one of the the parts that

01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,160
is really hard

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,520
because then somebody needs to pick up

01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,599
the open source component and then

01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,119
really drive it in that direction and

01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,440
sort of invest in it

01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:31,119
and do that together with the community

01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,720
so so even when you do that you don't

01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,000
just take the component and put

01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,480
something proprietary on top

01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,359
of it so we really need to invert the

01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,039
direction here

01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:40,880
you need to start from what's out there

01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:43,280
that could help

01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,799
and and car maker to to get the

01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,599
experience they want

01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:48,079
and and then to specify what has to go

01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,520
on top

01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,359
of the open source components of the

01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,079
shared platform rather than the other

01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,319
way around

01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,680
that that's the industrial problem i'd

01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:59,039
say

01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:01,599
um let's see and

01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,079
i mean why is this a problem it's it's

01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,400
it

01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,079
it could be one way to one thing is to

01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,599
say that we want open source and

01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:09,520
and it's a good thing and there are

01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,160
ethical aspects with it but even if you

01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,160
look at it

01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,839
from from the business side of an

01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,599
automotive maker

01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:17,039
it's not invented here driven

01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,880
development where you start from your

01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,680
own requirement set and sort of

01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,680
everything has to be custom-made to your

01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,000
needs is a very expensive way of

01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,680
building anything

01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,599
you also end up in very strong vendor

01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:32,640
lock-ins historically

01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:35,760
i've been to numerous oems

01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:38,640
in asia u.s and europe and then

01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,559
it's a situation throughout the industry

01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,000
the maintenance costs are huge

01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:45,200
because you maintain your own software

01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,799
stack rather than using what's upstream

01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,799
that's also one of the risk of falling

01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:50,559
behind so so it's quite common to sort

01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:52,000
of adjust an open source component and

01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,000
not follow along

01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,839
which means that at the end of the day

01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,200
you're maintaining your old

01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:00,799
fork by yourself anyway and and really

01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,799
the biggest one is that you you can get

01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:04,000
access to smart people outside of the

01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,960
automotive industry

01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,480
which is a huge boost because soft train

01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,880
automotive

01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,000
is not where all software people work

01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,319
it's a rather small

01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,319
niche

01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,400
but what are the open source actors here

01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,880
so so this is just

01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,920
a very quick recap from from what i've

01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,599
seen so

01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,400
2009 genevieve was started formed expert

01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,480
groups had

01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,000
had industry meetings discussed on how

01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,200
to do this and i mean genevieve

01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,760
to me is a big driver in making sure

01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,520
that

01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,200
we actually have a linux foundation for

01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,880
these systems these days even though the

01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:44,079
services on top aren't

01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,440
aren't open source they build components

01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,839
that they then build

01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,680
create the development platform to

01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,880
demonstrate how the components can be

01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,760
integrated but compute

01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,480
components are generally reusable

01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,920
outside of genevieve

01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:02,720
since a few years back genevieve sort of

01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:05,039
focused on the on the co-existing with

01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,920
other systems on on how to integrate the

01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:10,880
linux based system into hyperbase

01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,400
hypervised system with other systems in

01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,119
parallel and so on

01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,119
so so the component development has in

01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:20,319
my opinion slowed down a bit

01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:24,079
um there is also another

01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:26,079
organization joining the market so 2016

01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,720
the automotive grade linux project was

01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,680
started

01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,720
this is run within the linux foundation

01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,039
it has a

01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,319
similar structure so expert groups of

01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,720
the various topics

01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,079
meeting writing requirements trying to

01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:41,839
find someone to implement it

01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:44,319
and and build things um but i'd say that

01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:45,280
agl in general builds their development

01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,440
platform

01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,559
first and the components are built for

01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,319
that platform

01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,400
which in my experience means that some

01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:55,119
of the components are harder

01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:58,240
to use if you don't buy it all they are

01:05:55,119 --> 01:06:00,559
time more tightly integrated

01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,319
both these organizations come from from

01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,079
this classical direction that we have an

01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:06,319
expert group we write the requirements

01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,480
and and then the intention is to fix an

01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:10,640
open source component to to suit those

01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,760
requirements but they still come from

01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,400
that perspective

01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,559
the top down this is what the car needs

01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,720
and and then we build it

01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,760
so so it's kind of interesting when we

01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,200
had this third one

01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:25,760
entering um it was announced in 2017

01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,200
the the pole star cars are starting to

01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,280
reach market now

01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,640
so i'd say 2020 is the year when they're

01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,680
active

01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,680
the same goes for the other

01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,640
organizations i mean geneva was formed

01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,920
in 2009

01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,559
there weren't genevieve based

01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,720
infotainment systems back in 2009.

01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,400
this is basically google and the oems

01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,359
they have a very strong infotainment

01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,400
focus

01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:46,880
they have a fixed offering this is what

01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,880
it is

01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,559
and and then it's up to the oem to

01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,920
integrate it so they've been able to

01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:56,880
to turn this requirements

01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,359
situation around which is good but at

01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,079
the same time i'd i'd argue strongly

01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:02,799
that this is

01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:04,720
not an open source solution per se i

01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:06,559
mean the the google automotive services

01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:09,039
are definitely not open source

01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,839
so it's um it's something that creates a

01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,079
bit of

01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:14,000
movement in the market but it's i'd say

01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:17,200
it's not a big open source platform i

01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,240
i wouldn't be satisfied as an

01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,760
open source proponent if uh if google

01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:25,119
dominated the market

01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,119
that wouldn't have solved my problem

01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,280
so why is this i mean we have we have a

01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,400
set of oems

01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,160
uh they act with uh with suppliers that

01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,480
are usually called tier ones tier twos

01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,319
to

01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,839
trees depending on how close they are to

01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:41,039
the oem

01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:42,000
those you have an infotainment device

01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,760
manufacturer that

01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,839
produces a silver box so the actual

01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,640
electronic device that you put in the

01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,079
cart

01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,599
with the software but of course they

01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,520
source a lot of the software from

01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:53,200
outside like speech engines

01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,839
navigation systems and all of that and

01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,280
they do a lot of the software

01:07:54,839 --> 01:08:00,000
integration

01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,640
there are quite complex relationships in

01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,799
here

01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,920
um and and the tier ones supply

01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:07,760
different oems in different

01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,480
organizations and sometimes a tier two

01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,559
to one

01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,880
oem could be a tier one to another and

01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,720
so on

01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,159
the interesting thing is really what

01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:19,440
what's holding us back

01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:20,239
and and my conclusion after more than a

01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,520
decade in this

01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:25,279
is uh is this you need to scratch your

01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,000
own edge

01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:29,520
who who are the members who are the ones

01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,920
contributing and driving

01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,560
the software development in these open

01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,920
source

01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,839
organizations um

01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,080
and to to a large extent it's not the

01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:43,440
oem to solve their own problems

01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:46,080
it's the oems paying someone to maintain

01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:49,040
a component and as soon as that

01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:51,279
stream of money goes away the

01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:54,159
maintenance goes away as well

01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,400
so you need to really bring the software

01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:58,319
closer to the om and then we clearly see

01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,640
this in many many cases i mean

01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:03,120
ambition is one case where that happens

01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:06,080
but it happens with other oems as well

01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,560
um but this i i think is one of the the

01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,799
real

01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,839
factors that needs to go in to change

01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:11,440
the industry

01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:13,359
unless you scratch your own age you're

01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,600
not driven to fix

01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,120
the complex problems behind which are

01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,040
really more

01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:22,159
of a business structure or managerial

01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,159
than a technical issue

01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,560
so what can be done what challenges do

01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,400
we have there are there are tons and

01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,520
tons of challenges

01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:33,440
one of the things that i try to to tell

01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,759
people when doing interviews or trying

01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:39,040
to get them to work within infotainment

01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:42,880
is that this today is primarily not an

01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:45,359
algorithm or or doing cool maths

01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,120
kind of problem area then you can go to

01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,600
to autonomous driving or do

01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,600
voice recognition engines and and smart

01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,800
navigation algorithms

01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,760
but for infotainment it's more about

01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,040
the integration of lots and lots of uh

01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,040
features

01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,640
and and this is where you basically have

01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,400
to pick and choose good

01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,360
infrastructure for various problems and

01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:10,000
put them together into a complete system

01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,120
and and then i want to relate this then

01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,280
to to what happens

01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:15,040
in in the open source space and and

01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,400
primarily what happens within kde

01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:20,640
so i mean where are we close together

01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,679
where can we touch base and actually

01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,520
help each other

01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,719
so i picked out some areas there are

01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,520
many many more

01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:29,040
um i've worked for for more than two

01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,120
years in the same project and

01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,960
and we've sold more than six projects

01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,920
it's basically weekly projects so

01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,719
so if you're if you want to hit problems

01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,199
or challenges

01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:40,080
just just reach out and i can give you

01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:43,440
one

01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:45,040
um but the very first one i'd like to to

01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,080
bring up is screen dimensions and

01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,960
orientation

01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,679
um you have extremely wide screens in in

01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,920
some cars

01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,719
where it fits into the dash on on the

01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,480
width

01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,640
but you also have setups like the the

01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:58,719
volvo and the recent release new vs

01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,960
class where you have a standing screen

01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,400
um you also want a single user interface

01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,400
to to work in the front where you might

01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:07,120
have an extremely wide or

01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,640
a4 sized portrait screen with the rear

01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,320
seat where you generally have a smaller

01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,719
screen integrated into the

01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,440
into the headrest of the front screen

01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,239
and a good

01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,159
framework for that um is needed so

01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:21,600
kirikami and and really

01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:23,679
emphasizing the ability to to move

01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:27,120
between screens and to provide

01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:28,320
patterns to to do that is a really good

01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,159
starting point to

01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,560
to get closer here and and to get

01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:36,080
contribution

01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,840
um another thing is collaboration

01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,719
between screens and users and i mean

01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,000
this is

01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:43,760
where everyone's going now so and i mean

01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,840
if you buy a high-end car this is

01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,600
probably where you are to some extent

01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,920
but you want to share

01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,520
information you want to be able to view

01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,239
the same media contents on various

01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,480
screens you want to be able to pass

01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:58,320
let's call it video streams or or links

01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,280
to video or whatever however you do it

01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,159
technically

01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,840
between the different screens um and

01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:05,360
this is where technologies like kde

01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,239
connect comes into the picture i

01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,880
i love kd connected the game changes to

01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,560
me is used

01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,320
the simple use case of audio docking

01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,719
when my phone rings

01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,360
but to take that further to to allow to

01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,920
to sort of

01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,600
share cast and move things in between

01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,640
screens and devices

01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:24,000
that's exactly where where we want to go

01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,679
and then that's exactly what the whole

01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,560
industry is looking for a solution and

01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,920
if kd connect could be part of that that

01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,600
would be awesome and i mean

01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:34,000
having plasma big screen in there as

01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,239
well excites me because that's very

01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
close to rear seat infotainment system

01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:40,000
is it possible to connect that to kde

01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,320
connect how can we make that generic

01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,159
can we can we allow kdconnect to sort of

01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,400
be the base

01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,600
or a wider casting sharing moving

01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:52,159
framework

01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:52,159
there are big opportunities here and

01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:55,760
even more when it comes to this casting

01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,440
and routing and zone the the audio and

01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,199
media routing is is one of the things

01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:01,840
that makes

01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:04,480
car systems very complex because in a

01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,640
high-end car you have many many cameras

01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:08,400
for surround views you have cameras they

01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,960
can create a projection of the car from

01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,640
the

01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,320
from above multiple cameras inside

01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,719
multiple microphones so that you can

01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:20,159
actually do

01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:22,320
video calls and uh and text recognitions

01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:24,239
from the various seats and then locate

01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,640
where the sound comes from

01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:28,880
so so really building these advanced

01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,920
media routing and audio frameworks is is

01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,280
important

01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:36,800
to validate linux but also to to linux

01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:38,320
with the the community services on top

01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,520
of it like pipe wire

01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:43,199
and pulse audio and so on on top of it

01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,280
and if this thing can be connected to

01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:46,480
the whole collaboration between screen

01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,600
story

01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:52,480
that makes it even stronger

01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,280
um we have another one that i'd like to

01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,640
bring up

01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:58,320
uh i like kde kd boots quickly i run a

01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,679
pine book and i'm impressed over how

01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,040
fast it runs

01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:03,520
on actual low-end hardware let me call

01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,560
it that

01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,800
and then pine64 can say what they'd like

01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,679
uh but one of the big engineering

01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,880
challenges for

01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:15,280
that i face is really that we have a

01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,640
legal time limit for two seconds

01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,400
to have the rear view camera up and

01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,920
running um and

01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,520
generally you want to have warning

01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,560
sounds before that

01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,760
and traditionally you have a requirement

01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,600
to have a full

01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,360
let's call it desktop experience but the

01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,239
full infotainment experience and an

01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,320
interactive system up by four five six

01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:36,560
seconds depending on the brand

01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,719
uh me being sweden it's still summer but

01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:41,280
it i i would hate to have to wait for

01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:43,120
15-20 seconds to be able to turn on the

01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,800
the heat in the seat and then start

01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,520
defrosting the windows

01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,080
you need these things quickly so keep it

01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,480
light

01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:53,360
keep keep additional features optional

01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:56,239
make it possible to load things

01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:57,360
after afterwards to to load things on

01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:59,199
demand so to speak

01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,920
that these are important things to make

01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:03,600
the components reusable to be able to

01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,600
to actually integrate them in this type

01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,080
of of system

01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,760
um and then i just decided to add two

01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,159
more challenges that are good to be

01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,679
aware

01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:16,480
of but are hard to solve in a

01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,840
generic enough way and also in in an

01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,480
open source way because they they

01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,280
involve

01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,480
non-open source technology uh so so one

01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,640
of the trends is that you have a

01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:27,760
hypervised system in in these

01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:29,120
setups and and to some extent you you

01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,600
have another system

01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,320
be it for instance qnx or integrity to

01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,600
to drive

01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:38,000
functional safety subsystems or or even

01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,640
full android systems sitting next to you

01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,560
and again

01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,159
here the sharing of video and audio and

01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,560
compositing of graphics and

01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:46,239
resource sharing is important factors to

01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,400
to take into account

01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:49,360
but also sharing state how do you share

01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,000
your contacts

01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,760
is it do you have a centralized service

01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,840
for contacts and so on

01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,320
um and that then leads us over to the

01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,320
functional safety area

01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,080
where you have things like the telltales

01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,320
in the instrument cluster

01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,480
it might be if you have an augmented

01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:09,120
reality system that you actually drive

01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,600
according to all these things that are

01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,000
sort of

01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,840
puts you in the in the risk of hurting

01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,719
something damaging equipment or even

01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,080
killing people

01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:19,600
if they fail and here you

01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:23,679
generally don't build the systems on

01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:25,679
linux but you need to be able to

01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,760
coordinate the graphics between the

01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:29,920
different systems

01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,280
the cute safe renderer is out there as

01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,600
one example of how to do it

01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,040
it's basically a glorified bit but it's

01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,440
written according to

01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,520
all the process rules that needed to to

01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,520
get a tif approval and

01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,640
and to be a part of a functional safe

01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,920
system

01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,920
um so it's it

01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:51,120
you need to have these flexibilities in

01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:53,520
and now council is counting down quickly

01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,280
i'm talking too slowly so yeah there are

01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,159
many many more challenges and i love to

01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,760
speak about

01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:59,600
more challenges than the ones i talked

01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,840
about but

01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,920
why am i even here i want to tell you

01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,880
all keep on being awesome

01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,440
um and keep on building infrastructure i

01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,800
mean

01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:13,170
many years ago in a rainy summer i did

01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,040
this metric kf5

01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:17,120
[Music]

01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:19,040
let's call it embryo that were later

01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,239
picked up by uh by the community in

01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,000
folker which is great

01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:24,960
because i did not have time to maintain

01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,520
it uh but but building kde frameworks

01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,600
providing kirigami providing great

01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:32,719
documentation and being helpful that

01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,080
i mean these are great great things that

01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:37,120
that makes kde

01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:39,280
technology attractive um

01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:42,800
and even though you you probably will

01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:45,840
not see a plasma interface in an actual

01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:48,000
car produced by an oem the techno the

01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,800
underlying technology is so close by

01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,440
so you probably already share more than

01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,199
you think

01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,040
between your desktop between what you

01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:56,239
actually work on between what you

01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,159
actually improve

01:17:56,239 --> 01:18:00,000
with the car industry and having the car

01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:01,040
industry use it would mean more use

01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,239
cases

01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:06,560
more resources to to fix issues to to

01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,440
sand off the rough corners and and to

01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,000
contribute back

01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,679
so so i really hope for this to to move

01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,520
closer

01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:18,239
and that means i made it on time i think

01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:20,000
it says one minute left on the on the

01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:21,920
private chat from volca

01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,679
so thank you very much for listening uh

01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,719
i hope i made some sense even though i

01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,840
had to run part

01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,840
through parts of the slides

01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:33,600
and thank you for sticking perfectly to

01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:36,719
the

01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,440
to the schedule uh we indeed have a few

01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,800
questions

01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:42,800
um the the one

01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,520
most on people's mind seems to be what

01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,239
kind of car are you in there

01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,719
i'm i actually tweeted about this so as

01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,719
i

01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,719
made some fun of it a few years ago i

01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:55,120
saw an ad for a bmw

01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:56,159
7 series and they call the back seat the

01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:59,199
executive

01:18:56,159 --> 01:19:02,239
lounge i'm in the back seat

01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:04,320
of a 12 year old bmw 5 series where my

01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,120
eight-year-old son usually sits so i had

01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,719
to move over

01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:10,159
like old food stuff and to to actually

01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,360
be able to sit there so it's very far

01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:13,040
from the

01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,840
from the executive lounge but it's it's

01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,840
an old bmw

01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,640
okay um next question is uh

01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:26,640
what form form factor kde is used to

01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:29,920
our cars most uh most similar to

01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:33,040
uh desktop tablet phone um and

01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:36,239
start changing it depends on the brand a

01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:37,920
lot i mean the the

01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,600
the difference between a sheep car and

01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:43,360
an expensive car is a much

01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,440
bigger than you think hardware wise um

01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,480
so the high-end car basically has a

01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,880
high-power laptop

01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,800
integrated into it or multiple laptops

01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,560
while a low end car has something like a

01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,400
cheap android tablet

01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,320
in there and then i mean that's where

01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:58,560
you've seen android early on

01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,719
where where the oems or their suppliers

01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,480
actually did the porting

01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,000
but there's a there's a really big

01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,000
difference in in how much money

01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,520
you're willing to throw on the hardware

01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,840
uh depending on the car

01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,199
but i'd say in in general it's it's arm

01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:15,199
systems

01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:15,679
um with some sort of opengl capable gpu

01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:17,360
at least

01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,880
and and then it's just a matter of do

01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,440
you have half a gig of ram or do you

01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,080
have

01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:24,480
16 32 gigs of ram and then how many cars

01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,480
and so on

01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:32,360
okay um and the next question is

01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:34,719
uh will cars allow site loading of apps

01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:37,520
[Laughter]

01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:38,480
this was actually discussion in in an

01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:41,440
architectural

01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:43,840
whatsapp group that i uh i'm a part of

01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,840
at work

01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:49,520
they will be app-oriented i think where

01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,280
basically because you can't have these

01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,120
big projects where you build a single

01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,639
release for each line you need to go

01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:57,280
towards an

01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,679
a rolling release model and you need to

01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,360
let

01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,760
different parts of the software develop

01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:04,560
at different cadences

01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,280
if it would be presented as have to the

01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,760
end user

01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,199
is one question the other one is is the

01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,040
end user even allowed

01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:13,280
to install something or do you get like

01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,800
an options package that

01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,320
simply defines your applications and

01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,600
site loading is

01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:21,120
even one step further um i don't know

01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,480
it's a it's a management question i

01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:24,800
would love to be able to

01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:27,280
uh i would even like to be able to even

01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,960
though it would void my warranty

01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,159
because you have a slightly older car

01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,679
that would mean that you can really

01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:34,000
bring it forward

01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:36,719
and warranty for for the infotainment

01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,239
system might not even be

01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:41,520
be something that you worry too much

01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:45,120
about because it's already void

01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:48,400
great um then the next question we have

01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,920
is how much do you usually upstream when

01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,480
developing at an oem

01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,960
um is there a tendency or effort to

01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:57,520
upstream more

01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,159
i would say that historically it's been

01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,760
very low

01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:01,360
i i've been in projects where you

01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,960
actually pick the version of all the

01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:06,400
components at the start of

01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:08,560
a three four five year project uh

01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:12,000
in order to be able to stabilize them as

01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:13,440
as you put it um

01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,120
and that basically means that even

01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,719
though you you upstream something you're

01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,400
you're probably three or two five years

01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:20,159
too late in doing so so nobody's

01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:23,520
interested in it

01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:25,679
um and there's also the

01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,600
the issue that the suppliers are paid to

01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,880
to deliver the function and not to work

01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,719
well with upstream

01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,239
um this is one of the reasons for me

01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:34,560
joining ambition because this is an

01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:36,480
oem stepping in and taking the

01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,800
integration responsibility

01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,719
and i mean i brought up some of the

01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,880
advantages of moving closer to open

01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,719
source and maintainability is one

01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,639
um and there we're actually fighting

01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,400
very very hard to find a good way to

01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:51,520
upstream and i i do know that we

01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,080
we have open sourced part of our

01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,480
solution

01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:56,239
and and we're working on i mean it's

01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:58,719
it's almost a political work to to

01:22:56,239 --> 01:23:00,639
enable it within the company

01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:02,080
how do we do this how can we allow

01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,440
people to do it but would

01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,159
i know that we are moving in this

01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,760
direction and i would assume that other

01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:09,520
engineers are moving in this direction

01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,840
but i don't know where other oems stand

01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,840
on this

01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,239
okay um i think you have uh already

01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,800
mentioned

01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:20,320
uh the already answered the next

01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,199
question on how closely you are

01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:26,000
following up stream

01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:28,000
that leaves the last question on how

01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
complicated is all this with the

01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
conservative software life cycle in the

01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,679
automotive industry

01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,360
and that's that's the whole complication

01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:38,239
the the problem is that you're building

01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:40,400
a piece of software for a specific car

01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:42,639
specific specific hardware device that

01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:44,800
you upgrade maybe every three years

01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:47,520
and the whole industry needs to move to

01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,280
to rolling release model somehow or

01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,639
to decouple the software development

01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:53,920
from from the uh

01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:56,159
from the car but of course that that

01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:59,120
clashes a bit in how you traditionally

01:23:56,159 --> 01:24:00,880
sell and run these companies because

01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,480
if you get the newest software even in

01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,120
the in the cheapest model and the

01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:07,199
high-end one at the same time

01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,719
it might confuse the the customer base

01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:11,280
so it's uh

01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:12,320
i think it's necessary um the

01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,639
alternative is that

01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:16,719
google's eats the whole industry as they

01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:18,800
ate the mobile industry

01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,760
and and they do a rolling software

01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,320
release so

01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,679
and and the the oems there simply have

01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:27,520
to live with it

01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:27,520
and i think that's where it will land

01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:34,880
okay uh thank you very much johan again

01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:38,239
um we now have

01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:41,679
uh another set of uh fast track

01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:44,500
talks coming up in room one um and in

01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:46,000
room two so here we'll continue in

01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:50,239
[Music]

01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:59,840
at 7 pm utc uh with explore

01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:59,840
thank you very much see you around

01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:20,840
hi everyone in room two

01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:23,280
we should be starting in about four

01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:27,360
minutes

01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:31,199
camilo if you're here i've made you

01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:31,199
moderator and the presenter

01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:41,040
but you need to connect to audio again

01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:41,040
to be able to speak

01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:50,400
camilo if you are here we might

01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:54,960
message me here or in the chat

01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:05,440
okay i see your slides but

01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,840
you are still muted so please click on

01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:08,400
the

01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:09,520
headphones button somewhere at the

01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:12,560
bottom

01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:19,840
and you should be able to join again as

01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:19,840
as a speaker as well

01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:24,960
hi hi

01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:33,840
okay seems to be working we'll be

01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:33,840
starting in about three minutes

01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:01,840
uh

01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:21,280
people seem to be just joining in

01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:23,360
there is a q a session for this talk

01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:25,840
so please use the shared nodes

01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:39,840
functionality to

01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:39,840
ask questions for camilo

01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:09,440
and right on time we are starting with

01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:13,360
the maui project update

01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:16,480
take it away camilo hi so

01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:17,920
uh welcome everybody i'll be talking

01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:20,159
about some updates

01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:21,520
plans and discussion about the maui

01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:25,040
project

01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:25,040
so to start

01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:32,800
we have our first stable red okay so

01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:35,280
for those who don't know the my project

01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:39,199
is a group of applications services

01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:43,520
libraries and a user interface framework

01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:46,960
and called maui kit which works on

01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:48,960
top of kirigami and is aiming for a

01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:53,360
convergent and multi-platform

01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:53,360
experience so

01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:59,040
we had a couple months ago our first

01:58:56,480 --> 01:59:01,440
stable release

01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:02,159
and this is our some of the topics i'm

01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:05,920
going

01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:10,159
to quickly cover in this presentation

01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:13,840
so this is about the stable release the

01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:16,880
current kitty review process

01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:19,360
the current state of the project our

01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:22,639
plans for the project and roadmap

01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:25,199
and last the a little about the

01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:31,840
manual project in regards to the

01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:31,840
consistency consistency in core

01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:39,520
so our first stable release we have

01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:43,360
packages for windows for android

01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:46,560
and also for for linux both for

01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:49,199
arm and regular

01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:49,199
64.

01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:53,360
so we have the first stable release on

01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:55,520
may

01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:56,560
we have stable release for the framework

01:59:55,520 --> 02:00:00,560
our kit and

01:59:56,560 --> 02:00:02,480
for seven applications uh

02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:05,360
covered like file management image

02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:10,000
viewer music player

02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:13,280
and notes taker and a simple text editor

02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:18,560
we will providing up images

02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:18,560
apks and some installers for windows

02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:27,040
with these packages we were targeting

02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:31,119
linux android and windows

02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:33,119
so our previous stable release was no

02:00:31,119 --> 02:00:35,679
not ready yet for the create review

02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:38,639
process which is a

02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:39,199
standard process to go through to

02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:42,480
release

02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:44,400
software under the kde infrastructure

02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:46,239
so right now we are in the middle of the

02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:50,000
process we are

02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:53,040
working on getting mauiki

02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:55,440
the framework picks our image viewer and

02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:56,560
wait our music player and index our file

02:00:55,440 --> 02:01:00,000
manager

02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:01,760
to go to the kitty review

02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,880
we have already worked on the

02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:09,360
translations and we have moved from

02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:12,560
the cute built-in translation

02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:16,400
tools to kitty

02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:20,400
frameworks and we are in the middle of

02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:22,000
working on the documentation for mauiki

02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:24,000
so we are expecting to have all the

02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,280
documentation ready for the nexus stable

02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:31,199
release that is 1.2

02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:33,199
and that is uh going to be out by

02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:35,199
october

02:01:33,199 --> 02:01:37,040
and right now the mauiki documentation

02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:40,560
is around 17

02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:41,520
70 percent ready we are still missing

02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:51,840
some

02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:51,840
in live documentation to to qml files

02:01:53,280 --> 02:02:00,560
so this is our some of the applications

02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:01,360
that we are currently working on to to

02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:05,360
improve

02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:07,199
for the next release

02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:08,800
and right now i'm going to be talking

02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:12,800
about the current state of the

02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:14,080
project so we are still on the active

02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:16,719
development

02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:18,560
we are working on the documentation we

02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:20,239
are aiming for the stable release for

02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:24,639
october

02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:27,679
and we are planning on adding a macos

02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:28,800
support so we are going to be releasing

02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:31,599
packages for

02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:33,280
this platform and so that will be

02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:38,960
windows

02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:38,960
android and linux and macos

02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:43,280
also we are organizing all the

02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:46,239
development

02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:49,119
and infrastructure on the kirin brand

02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:49,119
that being like

02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:56,080
organizing the issues and dogs and

02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,599
all that stuff we also have another five

02:02:56,080 --> 02:03:02,560
applications that in uh

02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:02,560
beta or alpha state is understand our

02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:07,199
metric software store that is a store

02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:10,239
for

02:03:07,199 --> 02:03:10,239
getting up images

02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:14,480
we are also have the cinema that is a

02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:17,920
video player

02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:21,199
a web browser and a

02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:21,199
pdf reader

02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:30,400
and we are keeping the convergence

02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:30,400
always first

02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:43,920
so this uh this is a screenshot of the

02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:46,719
some of the applications that in beta or

02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:46,719
alpha state

02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:52,560
and right now i'm going to share to you

02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:58,320
a quick

02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:58,320
video of the proven state of the

02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,840
applications

02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:39,390
[Music]

02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:57,370
do

02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:57,370
[Music]

02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:04,480
so so far what i'm trying to do

02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:06,800
to showcase in these videos is that we

02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:09,440
have been working on making

02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:09,920
uh applications more convergence and

02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:12,719
this

02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:14,159
by allowing to have the same interaction

02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:15,280
that you will have in the desktop to

02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:20,239
happen on the

02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:23,440
on the phone that is a touch base

02:05:20,239 --> 02:05:26,320
uh touch base a device input

02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:28,480
so for example we have a lasso selection

02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:31,679
that is very common on

02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:34,719
on desktop with a mouse input

02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:35,599
and we are bringing this to the to the

02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:38,880
touch

02:05:35,599 --> 02:05:40,639
devices so we have like a translation of

02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:43,360
gestures where you have like a

02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:45,360
long press and a track you can trigger

02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,920
the lasso selection you can also trigger

02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:48,880
the

02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:49,840
drag and drop that previously was not

02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:52,159
possible

02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:52,880
with this new release we are going to

02:05:52,159 --> 02:05:55,920
have this

02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:59,360
so you can drag and drop

02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:02,540
items so this is what i'm showing so far

02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:35,840
in the video

02:06:02,540 --> 02:06:38,400
[Music]

02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:39,360
we're also working very we're also

02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:43,360
working on

02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:45,679
on keeping a cohesive and consistent

02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:47,280
styling across the platform platforms

02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:49,199
that we are targeting

02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:50,320
so that all the applications look the

02:06:49,199 --> 02:06:54,320
same across the

02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:55,679
other devices so we have improved the

02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:59,840
dialogues

02:06:55,679 --> 02:07:13,679
toolbars and another different

02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:17,280
ui parts of our framework

02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:20,480
uh these last two

02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:23,599
slides of this video are actually

02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:23,920
uh is working on a on a linux machine

02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:26,639
but

02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:28,239
with a touch screen so all the

02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:32,880
interactions

02:07:28,239 --> 02:07:32,880
and the input is being done by via touch

02:07:32,990 --> 02:07:41,330
[Music]

02:07:38,840 --> 02:08:00,800
gestures

02:07:41,330 --> 02:08:00,800
[Music]

02:08:04,890 --> 02:08:08,029
[Music]

02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:20,400
so right now i'm going to share a little

02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,840
bit

02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:23,840
of an interesting

02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:28,239
experiment that is going to we are

02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:29,679
trying that is an

02:08:28,239 --> 02:08:32,320
immersive experience with the

02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:34,639
applications in mercy being the

02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:35,840
put the content first so without too

02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:38,560
much

02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:40,400
so i'm going here follow it in the

02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:42,719
following video going to show you how it

02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:46,159
looks a little bit in

02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:49,360
our notes taking application and nota

02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:51,199
text editor picks the image viewer and

02:08:49,360 --> 02:09:05,840
also in

02:08:51,199 --> 02:09:05,840
wave our music player

02:09:25,679 --> 02:09:31,280
so we have been working in a lot of the

02:09:29,599 --> 02:09:34,000
applications

02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:34,960
with the bug reports that we have

02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,800
received

02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:39,840
fixing a lot of issues for example you

02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:43,520
know how we can already have

02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:44,560
correctly opening and closing split

02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:46,800
views

02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:48,079
and drag and dropping is working

02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:50,719
contextual

02:09:48,079 --> 02:09:51,920
actions on files it's working like

02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:55,360
sharing

02:09:51,920 --> 02:10:00,880
exporting and those other actions and

02:09:55,360 --> 02:10:01,760
also tagging the files we have improving

02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:04,079
also the

02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:06,560
the some of the ui components of the

02:10:04,079 --> 02:10:08,400
applications

02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:10,000
working more into conversion for example

02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:12,320
on weight

02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:14,079
the albums or arctis gridview becomes a

02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:16,320
listview and

02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:18,000
when the space is constrained and here

02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:20,400
you have the

02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,400
video

02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:26,320
okay so going back to the

02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:29,840
to the slide

02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:44,560
i'll show how to

02:10:42,079 --> 02:10:44,560
let's live

02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:57,040
so our plans and a roadmap

02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:57,760
for for the upcoming year after we have

02:10:57,040 --> 02:11:01,040
done with the

02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:05,280
finish with the release of of

02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:08,239
uh the next stable release 1.2

02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:10,639
this are some of the plans or the tasks

02:11:08,239 --> 02:11:12,960
we are going to be working on

02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:15,599
one is to fully move to cma right now we

02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:16,079
are using qma to deploy the applications

02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:19,360
to

02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:21,920
platforms like windows macos ios

02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:23,679
and android so we're planning to move

02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:26,079
fully to cmake

02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:27,360
that's going to take some time but we're

02:11:26,079 --> 02:11:30,800
going to do it for

02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:33,280
next year we're planning to add also

02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:34,239
io support so you can also have for

02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:38,239
example

02:11:34,239 --> 02:11:40,639
the notes taken application in your ios

02:11:38,239 --> 02:11:41,599
device and also in linux or if you use

02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:45,199
windows

02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:48,639
whatever and another big part

02:11:45,199 --> 02:11:51,440
for our convergence first a goal

02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:52,000
is to have data syncing using next cloud

02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:54,560
right now

02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,840
two of our applications are using this

02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:59,840
uh

02:11:55,840 --> 02:12:03,360
wave can sync and stream mix music from

02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:07,760
next cloud and boom can

02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:11,280
sync nodes we plan to add

02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:11,280
more syncing capability

02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:17,440
capabilities to next to index the file

02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:19,920
manager and to picks

02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:20,480
to sync images in your image gallery so

02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:23,360
you

02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:26,239
take your photos on your phone you can

02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:28,239
browse and on your computer

02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:31,760
we are also working on having some

02:12:28,239 --> 02:12:34,880
performance performance boost

02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:38,480
the applications are have some

02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:42,159
starting time delay on on the phones

02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:44,560
for not on android but also but on the

02:12:42,159 --> 02:12:46,880
on the pine phone and linux funds who

02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:48,719
are working on that

02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:50,480
also to have a more cohesive look and

02:12:48,719 --> 02:12:53,599
feel across all the platforms

02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:54,560
so we're aiming for a single style for

02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:57,760
all the

02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:59,280
platforms and all you know depending on

02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:02,880
each platform

02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:04,800
we're also planning a move to beta the

02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:06,400
applications

02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:08,400
to move to a stable the applications

02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:10,560
that are currently in a better state

02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:12,560
being the pdf trader that will have

02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:15,599
capabilities to

02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:18,639
to scribble to do doodles

02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:22,000
and take another annotations over pdfs

02:13:18,639 --> 02:13:22,000
and also to keep working on the

02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:33,920
documentation

02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:35,280
okay and the last thing

02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:37,920
for this presentation that i want to

02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:40,320
talk about was about the maui project

02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:42,239
in kiri and also about the consistency

02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:45,440
goal

02:13:42,239 --> 02:13:47,920
and to start uh the mod

02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:48,880
the model project is a whole this is a

02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:50,239
whole a project

02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:53,840
it's not a separate group of

02:13:50,239 --> 02:13:58,079
applications that you can divide

02:13:53,840 --> 02:14:00,960
i say this because

02:13:58,079 --> 02:14:03,199
although there is a very very good to

02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:08,239
have consistency in all the

02:14:03,199 --> 02:14:12,079
software from the kitty provides

02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:14,719
this consistency should not affect the

02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:14,719
way that we

02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:19,199
the way that we developed the maui

02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:22,400
project meaning that

02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:25,599
it is a whole project it's a whole idea

02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:28,079
and it's not divided into separating up

02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:30,239
different applications that can be

02:14:28,079 --> 02:14:34,000
affected by it

02:14:30,239 --> 02:14:37,040
and we also

02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:41,679
we have been a kitty project for

02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:44,719
over a year now i think

02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:45,920
and another of the of the reasons that

02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:48,719
we are following uh

02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:49,760
a different design guidelines from the

02:14:48,719 --> 02:14:54,400
plasma

02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:56,880
kirigami hats is to

02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:58,560
or i can speak speak for myself it's due

02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:02,159
to self-expression

02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:08,079
and being able to pursue

02:15:02,159 --> 02:15:11,840
our our ideas

02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:14,560
this is one of the reasons why why my

02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:15,760
might be seen as the as the project is

02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:18,560
in the outskirts

02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:18,560
of kitty

02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:23,199
i'm the consistency in gold so that's

02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:26,239
kind of

02:15:23,199 --> 02:15:26,239
what i wanted to say

02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:34,000
okay so that's it if you have any

02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:37,280
questions okay

02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,840
once work on oh thank you we do have

02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:41,040
some

02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:44,000
questions uh let me

02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:44,719
let me start uh the first one is what

02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:48,560
happened to the

02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:50,960
maui naming controversy uh

02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:51,840
i want to know so what i know is that it

02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:54,400
has been

02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:54,400
brought to

02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:59,760
a kitty didn't want to get too much

02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:05,760
involved so it was brought to

02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:07,599
blue systems which has the the

02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:09,199
the control over the name the the

02:16:07,599 --> 02:16:13,760
pattern i guess

02:16:09,199 --> 02:16:16,639
you can say so that's

02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:16,639
what i know so far

02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:21,599
okay the next one is how does maui

02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:24,560
relate to

02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:27,119
kirigami plasma mobile and the mainline

02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:30,639
desktop offerings

02:16:27,119 --> 02:16:36,240
so to start now is a kitty project

02:16:30,639 --> 02:16:36,240
as kirigami is also kirito plasma mobile

02:16:36,399 --> 02:16:43,200
maui it does not follow the

02:16:40,319 --> 02:16:46,319
the kirigami or plasma human interface

02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:49,200
guidelines it has its own he

02:16:46,319 --> 02:16:51,120
also uses kirigami for some convergent

02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:54,080
controls

02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:56,160
and so it is based on kirigami then

02:16:54,080 --> 02:17:00,160
kirigami is based on

02:16:56,160 --> 02:17:02,719
cute quid controls so we kind of

02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:03,359
what kirigami doesn't provide for us or

02:17:02,719 --> 02:17:05,200
what

02:17:03,359 --> 02:17:06,880
we want to do different we provide it

02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:09,599
with maui kit

02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:11,840
so that's kind of how it's related to it

02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:15,840
the applications can run just fine on

02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:15,840
plasma mobile

02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:22,880
okay someone asks can i avoid

02:17:20,559 --> 02:17:26,800
opening android studio for making

02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:31,679
android apps if i make them with maui

02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:35,359
yeah i i i only use kit creator to

02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:35,359
to to build the applications

02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:38,960
and to deploy them too

02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:43,840
um does maui support filming

02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:49,679
it supports streaming as any other kid

02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:54,240
quit

02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:56,639
application it is no

02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:57,519
like you can change the the style

02:17:56,639 --> 02:18:01,040
dynamically

02:17:57,519 --> 02:18:03,760
and not so much in android or

02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:04,800
or mac or windows on linux you can do it

02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:08,319
very easily

02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:11,439
by changing the cute

02:18:08,319 --> 02:18:13,519
quick control style variable and

02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:15,040
just create your own style so yes it

02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:19,120
supports

02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:19,120
styling to some some extent

02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:23,920
sorry i was disconnected for a second

02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:27,359
from the audio

02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:31,359
would it be a good fit for the librium 5

02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:34,479
and other mainline linux phones

02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:36,880
i just have not been able to to test

02:18:34,479 --> 02:18:40,000
their applications in their liver phone

02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:42,240
but uh for the past two years i have

02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:45,679
been able to test the applications on

02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:49,760
plasma mobile on a google nexus 5x1

02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:53,200
and they work just fine so i think yes

02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:56,000
i mean that's a our goal to be able to

02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:56,479
to have the application running on the

02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,479
or

02:18:56,479 --> 02:19:00,960
on the on on the phone but also on the

02:18:58,479 --> 02:19:00,960
desktop

02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:08,880
oh the next one is i think a

02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:10,240
longer one or for a longer discussion

02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:13,599
but we'll try

02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:14,080
thoughts about client side versus server

02:19:13,599 --> 02:19:16,639
side

02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:18,639
window decorations in a desktop context

02:19:16,639 --> 02:19:19,040
specifically from a consistency point of

02:19:18,639 --> 02:19:22,559
view

02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:22,559
with other kde apps

02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:28,160
i didn't get the question

02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:34,479
so basically client-side versus

02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:38,479
server-side window decorations

02:19:34,479 --> 02:19:42,319
okay so for from my personal

02:19:38,479 --> 02:19:45,519
uh point of view and opinion i i do like

02:19:42,319 --> 02:19:47,439
i think both offer different things

02:19:45,519 --> 02:19:49,359
having client-side decorations allow you

02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:52,960
more

02:19:49,359 --> 02:19:56,160
more freedom into designing the the

02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:59,520
application have a more cohesive look

02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:59,520
in terms of design

02:20:00,319 --> 02:20:03,359
some applications don't really make

02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:05,760
sense to have

02:20:03,359 --> 02:20:07,760
current site decorations because maybe

02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:10,319
they are too busy

02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:12,160
so having the controls in the head bar

02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:14,080
it doesn't really make sense but for

02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:15,200
simple applications i think it looks

02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:19,120
good

02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:21,760
and we are testing to to have this

02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:21,760
by default

02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:27,840
okay next question and i have a feeling

02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:33,040
it's from jonathan

02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:33,040
should i add maui apps to kde neon

02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:37,280
yes please i guess

02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:43,920
okay and then i have

02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:44,560
other specific design principles that

02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:47,040
make

02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:48,560
maui human interface guidelines

02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:51,840
completely incorporate

02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:54,319
incompatible with kde human interface

02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,319
guidelines

02:20:56,960 --> 02:21:01,680
the question is which which design

02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:04,160
principles are making incompatible

02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:04,720
or i didn't get yeah yeah basically why

02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:07,840
aren't they

02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:11,040
different from kdes so

02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:13,200
uh not really kitty i will say from from

02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:16,319
kirigami the way that was

02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:18,319
it was built it was based on having

02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:21,200
these pages navigation

02:21:18,319 --> 02:21:23,040
where you will have like a row uh

02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:26,399
navigations you will have like a

02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:29,280
drawer for two drawers

02:21:26,399 --> 02:21:31,520
a global drawer and a contextual drawer

02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:31,520
so

02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:35,680
when i first started i first started

02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,960
working on the music player that was

02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:39,280
white

02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:40,640
then i was to start to porting it to

02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:44,800
kirigami

02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:47,359
then i noticed uh i didn't kinda

02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:48,080
quite like the way that i was supposed

02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:50,479
to be

02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:52,960
done having all these actions in the

02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:56,160
global drawer i thought it was

02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:58,160
like a waste it doesn't

02:21:56,160 --> 02:22:00,479
didn't look that beautiful to me and it

02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:04,000
was like a waste of space

02:22:00,479 --> 02:22:05,600
so when i started to to create the

02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,840
components for weight the way i wanted

02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:10,800
to look

02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:14,560
and i kind of lost

02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:16,720
the train of those to the questions but

02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:17,840
yeah it's different it's the page row

02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:20,880
navigation well

02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:24,479
in my wiki we have like um

02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:27,520
um uh uh a b

02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:28,080
abuse uh kind of navigation would you

02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:30,160
have like

02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:31,600
a an application can have like a three

02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:33,120
of different views

02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:34,960
and you navigate between the views and

02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:37,760
you don't have like this

02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:40,720
this deep level of navigation that i

02:22:37,760 --> 02:22:40,720
think is confusing

02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:46,080
okay thanks and i think we have time for

02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:48,800
only a quick response to

02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:50,000
can i currently use cmake to build for

02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:55,280
android and

02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:58,800
will you suggest it yes you can do it

02:22:55,280 --> 02:23:01,680
i have tried it before and it works okay

02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:02,720
the only thing downside i think is to

02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:06,160
quickly deploy the

02:23:02,720 --> 02:23:06,800
apk generator to an android phone it's

02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:09,920
quite

02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:13,120
a hassle but if you

02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:13,680
you do a cmake prefix and you download

02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:17,600
all the

02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:20,000
binaries from the 3d android docker

02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:20,720
and you build all your environment it

02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:24,080
can be

02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:27,840
as quickly and as easy as you

02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:27,840
using to make wiki creator

02:23:29,439 --> 02:23:33,920
okay that was the end of our time thank

02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:37,600
you very much for this

02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:47,840
session claps in the chat please

02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:47,840
okay bye thank you

02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:59,439
we're taking a five-minute break and

02:23:56,240 --> 02:24:01,840
we'll be with with the next panel

02:23:59,439 --> 02:24:01,840
very soon

02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:21,840
okay everything seems to be in order

02:26:16,399 --> 02:26:21,840
so we'll be starting in two minutes

02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:21,040
there will be a q a session at the very

02:27:19,439 --> 02:27:25,680
end so please use the

02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:25,680
shared notes functionality to ask

02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:31,840
questions

02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:16,399
let's welcome leonardo aka

02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:19,760
amy spark who will tell us about

02:28:16,399 --> 02:28:19,760
hollywood and open source

02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:26,560
so good afternoon everyone i'm geraldo

02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:28,080
sebovia i'm speaking to you from

02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:30,319
argentina

02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:32,560
as adam said i usually go by the

02:28:30,319 --> 02:28:33,840
nickname amy spark i mean amy spark on

02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:35,520
github

02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:37,680
and today i'll be talking about

02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:40,080
integrating hollywood open source with

02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:41,920
kde applications

02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:43,439
and this talk will be a bit on the long

02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:45,040
side so please ask

02:28:43,439 --> 02:28:47,200
any questions in the chat and i guess on

02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:55,439
them at the end of

02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:58,560
this talk

02:28:55,439 --> 02:28:59,840
so for a bit of background who i am i've

02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:02,240
been studying for the master's in

02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:04,160
computer science since 2017

02:29:02,240 --> 02:29:06,240
at the university of nazareth in

02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:08,640
bayabanca in argentina

02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:10,560
my thesis is modeling animation and

02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:12,000
rendering of hair and food in future

02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:14,640
animation

02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,800
i got my bachelor's in computer science

02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:18,640
the previous year from the university

02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:21,280
my thesis was in real time inclusion

02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:25,840
country and reclamation

02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:28,479
i got involved in in open source in 2016

02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:30,000
with krita this was because david rayboy

02:29:28,479 --> 02:29:30,880
who is the author of pepper and kara the

02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:33,200
webcomic

02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:34,080
invited me to contribute to the painting

02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:37,120
suite

02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:40,319
and that kind of snow well from there

02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:41,399
and i participated with the homebrew

02:29:40,319 --> 02:29:45,040
project between

02:29:41,399 --> 02:29:46,880
2017 and 2020 maintaining mainly the

02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:48,960
task project

02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:50,880
and i participated in google summer call

02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:53,600
2000 2018

02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:54,720
implementing zootopia a herschel for a

02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:56,640
blender

02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:58,720
in the this application is named

02:29:56,640 --> 02:30:00,960
principal hair shader

02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:03,120
and my next participation was in season

02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:06,000
of kde 2019

02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:09,840
fixing circuit support from 14 color

02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,840
coding point power space operations

02:30:16,399 --> 02:30:21,680
so what what will this talk be about

02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:23,520
uh this talk is meant to share with you

02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:25,200
the experiences of working in my gsoc

02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:26,960
2020 project

02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:28,800
during the past four months i work on

02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:29,840
integrating an open source library from

02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:32,319
disney animation

02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:34,080
called cxpro which lets us render

02:30:32,319 --> 02:30:36,000
dynamic searches nucleated like the ones

02:30:34,080 --> 02:30:37,680
shown in the right

02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,680
there will be an additional talk in the

02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:40,319
student showcase next week in which i

02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:42,960
share some

02:30:40,319 --> 02:30:44,399
some details on the side of things this

02:30:42,960 --> 02:30:47,600
stock it will only cover

02:30:44,399 --> 02:30:47,920
sea export and its technical aspects the

02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:50,399
key

02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:51,280
take that i wanted to take it from the

02:30:50,399 --> 02:30:52,960
stock is that

02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:54,880
code which is production proven

02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:55,680
especially by a big content company like

02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:57,600
disney

02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:59,120
is not necessarily cross-platform like

02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:02,160
we would expect for usage

02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:03,920
here at kde throughout this talk i want

02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:05,520
to show you a selection of pitfalls that

02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:07,600
exist in addition as the expert

02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:08,960
code and how these were improved in

02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:10,319
pressure that is currently integrated

02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:12,000
within grita

02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:13,359
this is meant to show you where this

02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:15,600
kind of code

02:31:13,359 --> 02:31:17,280
i mean open source production proven

02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:28,240
authority by big companies

02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:31,760
can break and why that could happen

02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:35,439
so in the next a few minutes i go over

02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:37,520
four key aspects of the expert

02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:39,600
the first is assumption that makes us to

02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:42,640
the underlying platform

02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:44,880
the second is bloat or extra stuff

02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:45,840
the third internal internationalization

02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:47,760
efforts

02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:49,520
and the fourth point is streaming and i

02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:57,040
close all summer with the summary of my

02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:59,200
efforts throughout the project

02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:00,479
so the first subject of this talk is

02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:03,760
called platform and

02:32:00,479 --> 02:32:03,760
platform assumptions

02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:08,560
by platform assumptions i mean the fact

02:32:07,359 --> 02:32:10,960
that this kind of code

02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:12,880
runs in common platforms this means a

02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:14,479
software configuration that is known and

02:32:12,880 --> 02:32:16,960
reproducible

02:32:14,479 --> 02:32:17,680
for instance each year a committee led

02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:19,840
by the

02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:21,680
effects society technology committee

02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:23,680
releases a version of what is called the

02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:25,280
bfx reference platform

02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:27,439
this is a specification that sets

02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:28,479
structural pressure of components like a

02:32:27,439 --> 02:32:31,840
compiler

02:32:28,479 --> 02:32:33,600
libraries and sdk versions however we

02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:35,920
use sort of kde applications

02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:38,319
run them on just any platform that you

02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:41,280
can imagine

02:32:38,319 --> 02:32:42,240
this is just an example the localization

02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:44,479
team strategies

02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:46,240
translate application into 70 languages

02:32:44,479 --> 02:32:49,280
and counting

02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:50,720
kde frameworks runs on almost all of the

02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:52,560
desktop and mobile

02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:54,000
operating systems on the face of the

02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:56,240
earth

02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:58,720
neon the distribution of kde supports

02:32:56,240 --> 02:33:01,760
two architectures in 64 bits

02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:01,760
amd and arm

02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:04,880
ubuntu the upstream distribution

02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:08,240
supports

02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:12,640
not only 64 bits per source of xftg

02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:15,680
arm a bbc powerpc etc etc

02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:17,600
and this call example doesn't even cover

02:33:15,680 --> 02:33:19,120
all the possible library versions for

02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:21,040
instance qt5

02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:22,479
interesting section sets et cetera et

02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:24,240
cetera

02:33:22,479 --> 02:33:25,840
so the key question for working with

02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:30,640
cipro is

02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:30,640
does it work in all of these possible

02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:35,840
configurations

02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:44,800
the answer is no this needs to work

02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:45,439
as it was released is neither cut for

02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:48,160
not nor

02:33:45,439 --> 02:33:49,920
architecture independent to begin with

02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:51,920
there is a platform.h

02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:53,600
header where they attempt to punch

02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:56,720
missing defines performance

02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:58,720
specific classic timers and spin locks

02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:59,920
but this header assumes that running

02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:01,520
under windows means

02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:03,520
instantly that you are using the visual

02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:05,120
simplest task compiler

02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:07,280
and thus tries to link against the

02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:09,200
windows sdk and visual zipper plus

02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:11,359
specific libraries

02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:13,760
this should not happen for instance

02:34:11,359 --> 02:34:15,600
krita in windows doesn't use visual cps

02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:18,000
tasks but uses mingle

02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:19,120
so it should be able to detect gcc and

02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,960
instead use

02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:22,960
apps which are based on unix

02:34:23,200 --> 02:34:30,240
the second point is that cfor if enable

02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:31,280
uses ssc for instructions which is an

02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:34,560
extension to the

02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:38,080
86 instruction set these instructions

02:34:34,560 --> 02:34:40,240
are statically compiled which means

02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:41,439
that they are supported by only 98

02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:43,280
percent

02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:46,880
of the hardware server sample according

02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:48,560
to steam at a as of july 2020

02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:50,399
this means that the remaining two

02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:51,760
percent which

02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:53,920
are additional people with other

02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:54,399
hardware for that for some reason cannot

02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:57,439
do it

02:34:54,399 --> 02:34:59,120
catatron as a c4 will break that

02:34:57,439 --> 02:35:02,000
instantly that the crypto for

02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:03,840
these users as i said before they are

02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:07,680
specified at combine time with a

02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:10,479
with a switch flag which means

02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:12,479
that if enabled they will not compile a

02:35:10,479 --> 02:35:15,600
non-intel platform for your

02:35:12,479 --> 02:35:18,640
obvious reasons the worst thing of

02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:19,840
all this is it is it is only used in a

02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:22,960
single function

02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:27,840
which is around a crown front floating

02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:27,840
point numbers

02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:33,600
so this platform header was easily dealt

02:35:32,960 --> 02:35:35,680
with

02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:36,800
it just was a matter of factoring

02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:40,000
operating system

02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:42,399
specific items into our own cp files i

02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:44,319
only left opaque types and includes

02:35:42,399 --> 02:35:47,680
background.h

02:35:44,319 --> 02:35:48,960
and as for sse4 for the purposes of jsoc

02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:51,840
i left it alone

02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:54,240
this is what here behind the cmake plug

02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:56,960
i'll show you later if there is more to

02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:56,960
do about it

02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:08,240
going back to our example i mentioned

02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:10,560
that kde supports more than 70 languages

02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:13,280
however this means work does not because

02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:15,040
it is not locally independent

02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:17,280
the definition of locally independent is

02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:19,840
given in the simplest path reference

02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:21,840
which says that local is a set of

02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:23,680
features that are culturally specific

02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:25,760
which can be used by programs to be more

02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:28,000
portable internationally

02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:29,680
this in short means among other facets

02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:33,359
number formatting

02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:36,479
currency symbols south separator

02:36:33,359 --> 02:36:37,600
and decimal point decimal point is key

02:36:36,479 --> 02:36:40,560
here

02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:41,439
because there is quite a big bug and to

02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:44,080
explain it

02:36:41,439 --> 02:36:51,840
we need to jump directly into what we

02:36:44,080 --> 02:36:51,840
call the inerts of c expert

02:36:51,920 --> 02:36:57,359
so a disney c expo as a work of computer

02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:58,399
programming is actually two libraries in

02:36:57,359 --> 02:37:00,640
one

02:36:58,399 --> 02:37:02,880
the first is a language parser which is

02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:05,200
based on genius general purpose parser

02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:08,399
generator which is called bison

02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:08,880
and the lexical analyzer flex and the

02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:11,680
second

02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:14,319
is a uh ui toolkit based on qt

02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:14,319
purchasing

02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:18,319
why is local decimal point so important

02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:20,960
here

02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:22,880
because we have a question once an

02:37:20,960 --> 02:37:25,040
expression is parsed

02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:28,000
how does this library figure out the

02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:31,359
value of the number terminals

02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:32,720
this is performed in two in two separate

02:37:31,359 --> 02:37:34,960
ways

02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:36,720
the first one then the num the number

02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:38,000
terminals are directly passed with the

02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:39,760
film function with uh

02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:41,600
sorry with a c standard function called

02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:43,840
h off

02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:45,120
and the second one is done in the ui

02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:47,520
library

02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:49,359
commands are parsed used is a function

02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:52,000
called scanf

02:37:49,359 --> 02:37:52,960
these comments are used by the ui to

02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:56,319
tell

02:37:52,960 --> 02:38:00,880
where what uh what range does a

02:37:56,319 --> 02:38:02,479
variable have the key take here is that

02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:06,080
both of these functions rely on the

02:38:02,479 --> 02:38:06,080
current location of the application

02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:18,319
so the c17 standard

02:38:14,399 --> 02:38:20,160
in this section 7.11.1.1

02:38:18,319 --> 02:38:22,640
says that the default is a location

02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:25,359
called c

02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:27,120
but in in applications that support

02:38:25,359 --> 02:38:28,720
different cultures like creta this may

02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:31,760
not be the case

02:38:28,720 --> 02:38:34,240
for instance if you call set local with

02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:35,600
the variable lc numeric or you set lcl

02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:39,120
in your reset profile

02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:42,479
this may not be this may not be true

02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:45,840
here i put you a very little example

02:38:42,479 --> 02:38:50,160
you define a variable called channel

02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:52,240
you give it a value 0.5 or a half

02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:53,280
and you say for the ui that the value

02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:56,399
range is between

02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:58,960
zero zero inclusive to zero point five

02:38:56,399 --> 02:38:58,960
inclusive

02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:08,160
so in light of how er cx proposes this

02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:11,840
what may be the end result the answer is

02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:11,840
it depends on the operating system

02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:18,160
on the left you've got mac os

02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:20,080
when you launch the application by

02:39:18,160 --> 02:39:23,280
double clicking it it starts with

02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:24,080
a clean environment unless the developer

02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:28,080
of the

02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:29,840
user does something weird with startup

02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:32,720
it has a clean local and you get

02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:35,439
expected results

02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:36,960
on the right you have linux in linux

02:39:35,439 --> 02:39:38,640
since all applications incurred the

02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:40,319
syllabus from their parent

02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:42,319
which in turn sincerely gets from the

02:39:40,319 --> 02:39:45,280
user profile

02:39:42,319 --> 02:39:45,600
stuff happens the example in the right

02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:48,160
was

02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:52,160
that it was gotten with the location to

02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:54,399
spanish of spain

02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:55,840
the key take here is that the parcel is

02:39:54,399 --> 02:39:58,080
incorrectly

02:39:55,840 --> 02:40:07,040
located dependent when it passes its own

02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:11,280
language syntax

02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:13,920
so frequency fixing this issue

02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:15,600
means being sorry making the parser

02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:18,960
locally agnostic

02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:20,000
which is not easy because the the system

02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:23,439
that provides no standard

02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:26,479
way yet esd and windows

02:40:23,439 --> 02:40:28,000
have underscore l versions of these

02:40:26,479 --> 02:40:31,279
functions 8 of s

02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:34,399
sdr today et cetera et cetera

02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:37,279
linux and my linux mint both the senior

02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:40,960
g and uc library as well as muscle do

02:40:37,279 --> 02:40:40,960
not provide any of these functions

02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:44,720
we've got an excellent alternative to

02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:48,399
replace this

02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:51,680
which is called std from cars in the

02:40:48,399 --> 02:40:53,680
in the car come header from 17

02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:54,800
however krita's baseline in super class

02:40:53,680 --> 02:40:58,399
11 not

02:40:54,800 --> 02:40:59,760
17 and there is a cross-platform

02:40:58,399 --> 02:41:01,840
replacement

02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:02,800
called scn leap from a discussion in a

02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:06,399
github

02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:07,840
which works on cps plus 11 but however

02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:10,399
its location support is just a

02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:13,600
placeholder it doesn't have any low case

02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:16,240
location support working at present so

02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:16,720
for the purpose of jsoc i elected to

02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:19,600
replace

02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:20,160
atop with a function called click crack

02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:23,359
atop

02:41:20,160 --> 02:41:25,600
from tiambo and

02:41:23,359 --> 02:41:26,399
as a scanner was simply work around but

02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:28,640
setting

02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:31,840
and resetting the locate before and

02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:31,840
after each call

02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:37,040
this was this is just the first

02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:41,520
objective of our task

02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:41,520
so we move to the next

02:41:42,240 --> 02:41:45,840
which are called bloat

02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:52,080
what is meant by bloat in this context i

02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:54,000
mean

02:41:52,080 --> 02:41:55,359
literally anything that a host

02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:57,840
application like rita

02:41:55,359 --> 02:41:59,520
doesn't need to use or know in order to

02:41:57,840 --> 02:42:02,080
embed cx4

02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:03,279
this means this means unused and

02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:05,200
unnecessary features

02:42:03,279 --> 02:42:07,840
for instant code that is isn't used

02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:09,680
anywhere which it appears for to be for

02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:13,359
disney internal tools

02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:16,080
as well as a plugin system i also mean

02:42:13,359 --> 02:42:17,840
enlarged headers for instance multiple

02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:19,840
classes per header always that's not

02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:22,640
repeating the header rancidity

02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:27,840
called separation that is more in the

02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:27,840
next slide

02:42:28,399 --> 02:42:32,479
by blood i also mean duty for support

02:42:30,800 --> 02:42:34,240
this is not not only a problem because

02:42:32,479 --> 02:42:34,800
it has been unsupported in our lives

02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:38,000
since then

02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:40,240
at least 2015 but because it prevents

02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:41,279
stunning uprights are going to see more

02:42:40,240 --> 02:42:42,640
later

02:42:41,279 --> 02:42:46,080
and it also brings deprecated

02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:49,200
dependencies like q of ngl

02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:49,760
there are also needed upgrades like find

02:42:49,200 --> 02:42:52,640
programs

02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:54,000
for bison and flex where you can just

02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:55,600
find package which was an initial

02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:57,840
intention of this name but it was never

02:42:55,600 --> 02:43:01,120
upgraded

02:42:57,840 --> 02:43:01,600
and there is a big need to not blindly

02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:03,439
install

02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:05,760
everything everything at the kitchen

02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:06,240
sink just copying and pasting every

02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:09,200
header

02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:09,200
to user

02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:14,800
and there are no requirements declared

02:43:12,479 --> 02:43:16,160
so there is literally no way for you as

02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:17,920
a developer to know what your

02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:20,240
application would need to link against

02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:22,800
at trying time

02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:24,399
there is a last one which i call my

02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:27,600
favorite because it was

02:43:24,399 --> 02:43:30,560
it cost me a bigger a big headache

02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:32,160
is that mac os and windows nipple

02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:35,760
generated partial files because neither

02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:38,000
of them bundle bison or flex by default

02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:38,880
but the current tool chain as it was

02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,640
shipped by this

02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:42,720
needs the user to manually copy these

02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:50,560
files to the redirection which

02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:52,960
should be done automatically

02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:54,399
as i said before and like the platform

02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:55,680
pitfall like we saw in the previous

02:43:54,399 --> 02:43:58,399
section this can be solved in

02:43:55,680 --> 02:44:01,200
conceptually simple ways

02:43:58,399 --> 02:44:03,520
to begin with we wall of units features

02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:06,319
by putting them behind cma cracks

02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:07,920
this was the case of unis unused distant

02:44:06,319 --> 02:44:10,880
internal windshields

02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:13,600
like deep water and curve and an entry

02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:15,840
point called experiment

02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:16,880
and the op and the open and gel based

02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:18,640
switches i put

02:44:16,880 --> 02:44:21,760
behind us another flag which is called

02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:24,319
enable opengl dialogues

02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:24,880
this point incidentally help us get rid

02:44:24,319 --> 02:44:26,880
of the

02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:32,160
deprecated link linkage which is

02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:35,040
excellent for building with gt5

02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:37,120
secondly and trading and trading the

02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:39,279
above i refactor which is as much as

02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:42,399
possible to split them into header and

02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:44,479
implementation files

02:44:42,399 --> 02:44:46,080
and finally i ported the extension tab

02:44:44,479 --> 02:44:49,359
to cement

02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:51,760
targets which means that cr

02:44:49,359 --> 02:44:52,720
features are now explicitly selectable

02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:56,160
through the wall of that

02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:58,720
described earlier everything is

02:44:56,160 --> 02:45:00,240
it can now be target linked in the host

02:44:58,720 --> 02:45:02,640
application which means that

02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:06,399
you no longer have to worry about and

02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:06,399
what targets we need to link against

02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:13,960
this is the end of the second objective

02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:16,080
we move now to the third one

02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:17,600
internationalization which is one of the

02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:20,240
most important features of

02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:20,240
open source

02:45:24,560 --> 02:45:29,760
what is formally internationalization

02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:31,439
the worldwide web consortium collects

02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:33,279
and i summarize the design and

02:45:31,439 --> 02:45:35,600
development of an application

02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:36,960
that enables easy localization for

02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:41,680
target audiences

02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:43,920
that vary in culture region or language

02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:45,279
cxpr is a new surfacing library through

02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:47,439
its ui toolkit

02:45:45,279 --> 02:45:50,240
so it should be able to support social

02:45:47,439 --> 02:45:52,960
localization when reporting its results

02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:53,680
this means as i said displaying error

02:45:52,960 --> 02:45:57,840
messages

02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:57,840
and ui text

02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:05,439
let's recall again from the first

02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:06,800
section c expert is conceptually two

02:46:05,439 --> 02:46:10,399
different libraries

02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:13,359
a language parser and an ui toolkit

02:46:10,399 --> 02:46:14,399
localizing the ui circuit is easy

02:46:13,359 --> 02:46:16,479
between brackets

02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:17,600
because it was an awful lot of work with

02:46:16,479 --> 02:46:20,720
regular expressions

02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:22,720
however we are saved by qt and

02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:25,359
kde extract make modules to glue the

02:46:22,720 --> 02:46:28,640
translation files

02:46:25,359 --> 02:46:29,359
but this leaves the parser or even a

02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:32,800
chance

02:46:29,359 --> 02:46:39,840
how do we localize a library that

02:46:32,800 --> 02:46:39,840
doesn't use cutie

02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:44,160
you can achieve this by with two

02:46:42,720 --> 02:46:47,520
alternatives

02:46:44,160 --> 02:46:49,279
the first you can con and update

02:46:47,520 --> 02:46:51,200
one of the qt translation tools by

02:46:49,279 --> 02:46:52,319
deploying your your own translation

02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:55,279
macros

02:46:52,319 --> 02:46:57,200
by this you can extract the messages you

02:46:55,279 --> 02:47:00,000
can later apply the translation from the

02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:00,000
toolkit side

02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:08,479
parameters example a given function

02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:10,399
here called a set has no definition

02:47:08,479 --> 02:47:11,920
you can probably interpolate these

02:47:10,399 --> 02:47:14,240
little parts in the ui

02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:17,920
but if you are going this path you can

02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:17,920
go i can do something better

02:47:18,560 --> 02:47:22,160
what i choose to do for jsoc was to

02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:25,920
refactor

02:47:22,160 --> 02:47:29,040
the whole library into error codes

02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:31,359
with a parameter payload

02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:32,399
this means that whenever the parser has

02:47:31,359 --> 02:47:36,080
an error

02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:39,040
it emits an error code with a parameter

02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:41,200
payload which is which is later taken by

02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:43,600
the ul toolkit

02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:46,479
since the ul toolkit is translated

02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:48,640
thanks to acuity and extract modules

02:47:46,479 --> 02:47:50,720
this means that household applications

02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:52,399
are now responsible for performing the

02:47:50,720 --> 02:47:55,279
interpolation of the message with the

02:47:52,399 --> 02:47:55,279
supply payload

02:47:59,920 --> 02:48:03,120
incidentally this internationalization

02:48:02,240 --> 02:48:06,640
effort

02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:06,640
also brings safety improvements

02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:12,000
in the left you can have the you can see

02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:14,000
the code verbatim from the original

02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:15,680
parser

02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:18,240
this is the example that applies when

02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:21,279
there is a synthetic syntax error or the

02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:23,520
parcel left and end of expression

02:48:21,279 --> 02:48:24,479
you can see that this is manually

02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:26,720
created

02:48:24,479 --> 02:48:30,240
and then copied is using a c function

02:48:26,720 --> 02:48:33,359
called s and printf

02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:35,279
on the right here you can have a look at

02:48:33,359 --> 02:48:37,760
how i did it in my project

02:48:35,279 --> 02:48:39,279
it is badly simplified with just an

02:48:37,760 --> 02:48:41,920
error code

02:48:39,279 --> 02:48:44,000
and then the ui library has the

02:48:41,920 --> 02:48:47,120
responsibility to interpolate it using

02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:47,120
simplest past strings

02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:56,840
we are finally at the last section which

02:48:52,960 --> 02:48:59,840
deals with how cx4 handles

02:48:56,840 --> 02:49:03,120
feminine

02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:03,520
by semi i mean that cs4 should respect

02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:05,040
the

02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:06,720
application steam styling and

02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:09,279
preferences which means

02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:12,880
both the user preferences preferences as

02:49:09,279 --> 02:49:15,040
well as the platform conventions

02:49:12,880 --> 02:49:16,960
in the example below you see that this

02:49:15,040 --> 02:49:18,800
is did not follow this

02:49:16,960 --> 02:49:20,479
as the original video the widget are

02:49:18,800 --> 02:49:24,319
heavily compressed and do not follow

02:49:20,479 --> 02:49:26,000
the non-cos gnomes convention

02:49:24,319 --> 02:49:28,560
in the right you can see an alpha

02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:30,319
version of my work also thinking genome

02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:32,319
but you'll see that the controls are now

02:49:30,319 --> 02:49:40,319
much more usable in terms of

02:49:32,319 --> 02:49:42,880
space and visibility

02:49:40,319 --> 02:49:44,560
as demonstrated previously controls were

02:49:42,880 --> 02:49:46,960
completely restyled to

02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:48,479
follow the post application streaming

02:49:46,960 --> 02:49:51,279
this involved decompressing

02:49:48,479 --> 02:49:54,640
all fields or labels or basic web text

02:49:51,279 --> 02:49:57,200
or icons as shown

02:49:54,640 --> 02:49:58,640
also i upgrading buttons and layers of

02:49:57,200 --> 02:50:00,399
modern alternatives

02:49:58,640 --> 02:50:03,120
in particular cream from layout and

02:50:00,399 --> 02:50:06,240
future button

02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:07,439
improving contracts in signals a syntax

02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:08,960
highlighting with a

02:50:07,439 --> 02:50:11,359
big thank you to aleta for her

02:50:08,960 --> 02:50:13,439
suggestions

02:50:11,359 --> 02:50:14,399
and enable color selections for vector

02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:16,720
variables

02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:18,560
this actually was a hidden feature which

02:50:16,720 --> 02:50:19,760
was broken and disney released and was

02:50:18,560 --> 02:50:22,880
uncovered when i did

02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:24,479
this the compression work

02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:26,399
which means there are now two ways to

02:50:24,479 --> 02:50:28,800
specify colors by clicking on

02:50:26,399 --> 02:50:29,760
the variable label by moving this little

02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:33,760
beneath each

02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:35,760
channel's input box and finally a fix

02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:37,359
it helps tool clips to make him fully

02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:39,840
accessible

02:50:37,359 --> 02:50:41,920
at this point i'd like to publicly

02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:47,040
publicly thank botola vancouver

02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:47,040
agata and davitryboy for many of these

02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:53,840
improvements

02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:54,399
as you may expect from this kind of of

02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:55,920
work

02:50:54,399 --> 02:50:58,720
these changes uncover additional

02:50:55,920 --> 02:51:02,399
mistakes in the developer side of things

02:50:58,720 --> 02:51:04,720
i fixed two hidden crashes on sea expert

02:51:02,399 --> 02:51:05,840
that were hidden by the original styling

02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:08,800
above the render flow

02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:10,560
when editing color gradients as well as

02:51:08,800 --> 02:51:13,760
initializing memory accesses

02:51:10,560 --> 02:51:14,240
in vector widgets and as a bonus track

02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:17,279
these

02:51:14,240 --> 02:51:17,760
timing changes enable users to use cpu

02:51:17,279 --> 02:51:21,600
widgets

02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:21,600
directly with duty creator

02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:30,000
so for future improvements

02:51:30,399 --> 02:51:33,840
are there any bits that i would like to

02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:37,200
separate after gsoc

02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:39,760
yes a first one

02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:40,319
modernize the codebase for 2c plus space

02:51:39,760 --> 02:51:42,080
02:51:40,319 --> 02:51:44,319
which brings as i said before safety

02:51:42,080 --> 02:51:47,439
improvements

02:51:44,319 --> 02:51:50,240
i would like to fully replace scan f or

02:51:47,439 --> 02:51:51,760
h off with stl alternatives

02:51:50,240 --> 02:51:55,040
as well as complete the cleanup of

02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:57,439
headers into separate files

02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:59,439
there is a plugin subsystem that i have

02:51:57,439 --> 02:52:01,840
not been able to disable yet

02:51:59,439 --> 02:52:03,439
i would like to do so and also see if i

02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:06,640
can implement this functionality for

02:52:03,439 --> 02:52:06,640
windows in a safe way

02:52:07,439 --> 02:52:10,479
to make is a scene maker the

02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:12,560
configuration step

02:52:10,479 --> 02:52:14,000
how to fix this press generated parser

02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:16,240
files because at this

02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:17,520
point they still use the the build

02:52:16,240 --> 02:52:20,319
folder that it was used

02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:20,319
in these days

02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:25,040
and finally research with this work will

02:52:23,279 --> 02:52:26,880
it could be match upstream

02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:28,880
which is complicated because of the

02:52:26,880 --> 02:52:29,680
license requirements of the translation

02:52:28,880 --> 02:52:32,080
things

02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:34,880
and also additional fixes are suggested

02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:37,359
by users whenever we release

02:52:34,880 --> 02:52:37,359
krita

02:52:39,359 --> 02:52:46,319
so for a summary

02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:48,800
we covered all problems that i founded

02:52:46,319 --> 02:52:51,840
during the development of this project

02:52:48,800 --> 02:52:52,560
and how cf was converted from production

02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:56,160
to a

02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:58,240
truly platform alternative in case we

02:52:56,160 --> 02:52:59,920
wasn't obvious this version has so many

02:52:58,240 --> 02:53:01,520
improvements that it's not directly

02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:03,600
compatible with the original from this

02:53:01,520 --> 02:53:05,840
new animation

02:53:03,600 --> 02:53:09,040
and all modifications are available at

02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:12,880
invent at invent.kde.org

02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:12,880
graphics that's cx1

02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:25,040
this concludes our journey and thank you

02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:27,840
i'm now open to any thank you

02:53:25,040 --> 02:53:29,200
very much unfortunately you're exactly

02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:32,640
on time to finish

02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:34,240
um so no q a time is left

02:53:32,640 --> 02:53:36,000
there were some questions into shared

02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:39,439
notes i guess

02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:41,120
they maybe people can email you

02:53:39,439 --> 02:53:42,479
maybe show the first slide again with

02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:45,920
your email

02:53:42,479 --> 02:53:48,800
and people will i think should be able

02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:48,800
to ask you then

02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:57,920
uploads for amy spark please in the chat

02:53:53,840 --> 02:54:01,200
and for everyone here in room number two

02:53:57,920 --> 02:54:05,040
we are not done for today in room one

02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:05,040
we'll be having the

02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:10,720
working group session part two starting

02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:10,720
in four minutes

02:54:13,359 --> 02:54:19,200
yep okay

02:54:16,399 --> 02:54:21,120
thank you again amy spark send send over

02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:22,160
questions to that email address and see

02:54:21,120 --> 02:54:35,840
you in room

02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:35,840
one in a few minutes

02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:48,720
again this was the last session for this

02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:51,760
room

02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:53,120
but go ahead to room number one for the

02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:59,840
working group session

02:55:53,120 --> 02:55:59,840
part two starting in three minutes

02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:02,880
last warning for everyone still in this

02:58:02,240 --> 02:58:04,960
room

02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:06,720
this was the last session please go to

02:58:04,960 --> 02:58:19,840
room 1 for the

02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:19,840
working group part 2.
