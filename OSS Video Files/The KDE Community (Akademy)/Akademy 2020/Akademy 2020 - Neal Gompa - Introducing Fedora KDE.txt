my name is neil gampa uh i'm from the

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,080
fedora project i'm here to talk about

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,000
fedora kde um so let's get on with it

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,519
and a little bit before we kind of get

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,199
into fedorkaty itself i want to talk a

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,080
little bit about myself just to give you

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,960
an idea of who i

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,559
am so uh i kind of call myself a

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,760
professional technologist for

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,200
whatever the hell that means um but i'm

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,680
a contributor and a developer

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,760
in fedora magia open souza and open

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,000
mandarin linux distributions

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,760
uh i am a member of the fedora

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
engineering steering committee so

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,399
that is the committee that runs that

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,520
essentially is the final

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,399
um arbiter of all of the major technical

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,440
changes

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,800
that occur in fedora releases um

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,879
i'm also obviously a member of the

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
fedora 86 hell otherwise i wouldn't be

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,600
talking to you about it

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,920
um and i'm a contributor to package

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
management software specifically rpm dnf

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
and related projects

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,560
systems management software management i

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,080
live a lot in the plumbing layers most

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
of the time

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,759
and for my day job i'm a devops engineer

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,520
at datto

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,680
incorporated who's a business recovery

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,759
disaster

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,840
business continuity disaster recovery

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,880
company based in norwalk connecticut

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,360
um they don't really matter too much

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,400
from from the fedora kd perspective but

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,880
you know

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
that's where i work um and you can reach

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,840
me generally

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
via twitter there's my twitter handle on

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
screen

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,479
um so now to the interesting stuff

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,280
fedora kde so

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,960
the dora kde spin is a curated

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,079
collection of software that demonstrates

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
the breadth and quality of the kde

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,119
ecosystem so the whole point

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,640
of this is that we're trying to show um

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:02,079
a fedora a kd experience

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,759
on fedora that is um relatively close

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,800
to what kde as a project aims for the

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,879
plasma desktop to look like

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,080
we retain as many of the upstream

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,640
defaults as

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,400
as possible there are some minor tweaks

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,599
here and there we look at paper cuts and

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,040
stuff like that

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,800
for the most part there's some minor

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,879
branding and usability tweaks

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,080
we use mozilla firefox as our default

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,760
browser this is something that all the

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,959
fedora desktop editions do

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,720
um and we use firewall d

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,480
for our firewall solution and it's

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,400
configured and we have the applet and

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,239
stuff like that as well as selinux

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
as our mandatory access control system

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,400
for security

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,120
um we ship as a live media iso for x86

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,440
systems and that's available from

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,840
kde.fedorproject.org

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
and we ship um disk images for arm

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,160
systems and that's a

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,599
at the arm.fedoraproject.org website

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,440
um we don't yet currently um

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,879
only because i didn't actually realize

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,519
we didn't have this and we're going to

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,239
hopefully

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,879
um i brought it up for discussion um

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,879
having

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,800
arm arch 64 which is 64-bit arm

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,360
for systems like pine book pro and so on

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,360
to operate in full 64-bit mode that's

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,720
hopefully going to come uh real soon now

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,080
technically it should just work it's

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,959
just a matter of like getting it switch

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,440
flipped

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
um so right now we have mostly 32-bit

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,400
arm but

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,720
you could of course do a 64-bit arm from

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,680
scratch and be able to

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,519
um get fedora kd that way as well

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,159
because we do build all the packages for

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,000
all of our architecture so even power

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,000
even mainframes if you're so inclined um

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,440
it's available for everything uh

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
although i would be really interested in

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,480
the use case for

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,200
kde on the mainframe that'd be fun um

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,720
right so that's fedor kde spin itself

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,319
and let's talk a bit about

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,959
the fedora kde sig

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,439
so the fedorak 86 started originally as

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,720
an

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,560
a little outside project um called

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,239
kde on red hat it was started by rex

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,280
dieter in 2003

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,040
um many of you may know about a may know

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
of rex dear he actually gave a talk

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,799
several years ago

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,720
i'm talking about the fedora kd spin

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,000
when it was first introduced back

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:19,040
in 2000 i think in um

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,079
was it academy 2009-ish i think

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,880
um i forgive me if i got the year wrong

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,240
but i know it was

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,080
a very long time ago um so

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
katie on red hat started through him and

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,280
like uh when the fedora project started

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,000
up and then started

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,040
incorporating um all of these external

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,280
red hat oriented

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
um or red hat ecosystem projects into

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,280
the main fedora project

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,919
um kdeon red hat merged into the fedora

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,160
project

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,600
at around that time um the merge of

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,720
fedora core and extras

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,360
uh brought that into uh

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,960
you know in into into focus as the kdc

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
and we were one of the first cigs to be

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,040
created

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,000
um and in fedora 7 along with the core

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,000
extras merge

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,400
as it's been called uh we also

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,720
introduced live cd technology and so

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,240
fedora gnome or the fedora desktop as

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
well as the fedora kde

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,360
spins for the first two to actually do

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,400
this

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,440
uh and so we rolled out with kd 3.5

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,479
in fedora 7 in 2007 and we introduced

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,240
kde foreign a year later with fedora 9.

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,560
um so today

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,520
you know we produce a kd spin based on

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
plasma 5.

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,759
we switched to plasma 5 with fedora 22

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,759
in 2015

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
some special purpose variants so these

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,479
are called fedora labs

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,160
in our ecosystem are based on kde

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,199
formerly we had a scientific spin that

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
was based on it

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,360
um today i believe the the most notable

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,000
one is fedora jam

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,440
we are in this mid transition to a more

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,240
active project management

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,800
structure we are starting to use a

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,039
packer

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,440
io project for doing project tracking

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,639
and we are in the process of uh

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,840
scheduling regular

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,280
meetings in irc um one thing that fedora

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,680
kd does differently from

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,560
virtually all the other variants in

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,360
fedora

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,800
is that we update the desktop

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,000
environment software so

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,039
plasma kd kf5

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,199
um cute all of those get updated

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,400
um continuously throughout the latest

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,400
fedora release

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,440
so we wind up saying like you know maybe

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,759
it'll uh release launches with um

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,919
5 14 or 5 15 um and it'll get 516 and

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,360
517 and 518

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,039
uh n519 um and then when the next fedor

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
release comes out then that chain starts

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,919
forward so we kind of maintain

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,000
updated fresh plasma um essentially as

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,400
the kde project releases it

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,680
we pull it into fedora and push it out

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,720
and so like

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,080
right now fedora 32 is on 5 18 it

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,800
definitely didn't launch with 5

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,280
18. it will get 519 as soon as we're

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,520
done

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,520
packaging it up and pushing it out um

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,880
and 520 will also be released

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,120
um for fedora 32 along with fedora 33.

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,720
uh i didn't mention it in here but we've

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,479
also taken over

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,360
um providing kde plasma for um

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,240
red hat enterprise linux and centos

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,280
custom

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,840
users those folks uh get it through

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,639
uh fedora extra packages for enterprise

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,440
linux

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
or apple as it's called for short um and

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,199
so for sent

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,080
rel eight and centos eight users they

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,720
get

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:36,160
uh they get the plasma 5 experience

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,520
so next

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,560
and i guess i'll show a little bit of my

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,120
desktop here because who doesn't love

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,400
seeing

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,080
stuff i'll share my screen

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,120
select window there we go

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,919
so you know this is uh obviously kind of

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,960
boring this is

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,280
um this is sddm at the lock screen

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,360
and so here's my desktop environment so

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,479
this is fedora 32

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,000
with plasma 518 uh

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,759
5 and as i said earlier we've got

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,319
firefox here this actually isn't

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,919
exactly bone stock fedora 32 i'm

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,440
actually testing some

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,520
user experience changes that have been

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,599
suggested um

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,120
to the sig and trying to see how things

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,400
work but you can see

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,240
we've got applications and stuff this is

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,759
otherwise pretty much stock we've got

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,279
our firewall there dnf agora

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:38,270
and also system stuff here

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,519
system settings and discover

00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,159
[Music]

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,800
and yeah so we've got pretty much

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,279
everything you would expect to see

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:52,959
um in the in the environment

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:56,160
uh you know it's nothing too exciting

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,839
uh and just to kind of show

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,080
you know dnf

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,080
uh

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:16,720
wow uh upgrade

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:19,200
ah that's why i'm clearly not doing

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,200
there we go

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
that this is this is what i get for uh

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,279
you know

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,040
not being so uh um

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,560
what is it having all my marbles or

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,680
whatever when it comes to this so like

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,800
we got updates for new firefox podman

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,160
or adb and stuff like it's it's a pretty

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,560
um simple and usable experience

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,800
in my view uh and since that's

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,240
and also fairly quick and also delta

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,880
rpms which is cool

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,880
uh i could talk on and on about like the

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,040
kind of basic stuff

00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:01,600
uh so it's uh it should be

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,600
almost done there transaction test

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,650
and

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,880
right that will be

00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,399
[Music]

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
that'll take a little bit of time

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,720
actually um

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,320
while that is happening also showing

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,160
i've also got some of the things that

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,519
are kind of coming down the pipeline

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,079
which uh oh right amount uh

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,839
so like my file system's all butterfest

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,399
and so on and i'll talk about that in a

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,760
minute

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,040
but you know there you go

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,959
it's it's pretty much uh you know aside

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,600
from

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,760
aside from you know it being fedora it's

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,079
a pretty straight kd experience

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,440
uh stop sharing my screen and so we're

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,839
back to

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,839
this um

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,839
and you know

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,920
there we go so as for what we're doing

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,720
for the future

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,480
we're looking at butterfest by default

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,480
as i showed i've already got it running

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,920
in my machine i've been using it for

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
five years now and i've been pretty

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,680
happy about that

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,959
um so fedor workstation and fedor kde

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,480
are driving the change for all the

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,519
desktop variants of fedora

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,279
to switch to butterfest um

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,279
we are also planning on switching to

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,640
plasma weyland by default for the next

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,240
fedora release

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,000
um i actually submitted the change

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,480
proposal uh yesterday

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,160
so we'll see it it'll probably make news

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,959
um when it gets picked up onto the

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,240
interwebs

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,360
uh later um but yeah so we're gonna

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,200
we're gonna pull that off and i think

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,040
that dovetails quite nicely to from

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
alice's talk just earlier

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,959
where he was talking about doing all

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,480
this work to make uh

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:51,279
you know plasma weyland uh awesome and

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,040
i mean frankly one of my laptops runs uh

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,440
plasma with weyland and it works mostly

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
fine

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,880
aside from one minor thing which is

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,639
weird

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,320
uh and still trying to figure out

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,040
everything generally works

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,800
we're also looking at paper cuts in the

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,399
fedora kd experience we've got some

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,160
issues filed from some folks and we're

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,519
looking at those

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,600
but the other interesting thing that

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
we're looking at is providing an

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,200
immutable os

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,440
variant called fedora kenoite so some

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,800
people may be aware

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,959
that um in the past there was a

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,399
so not in the past but like a few

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,600
releases ago

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,079
um fedora made waves with this

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,320
fedora silver blue variant which is an

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,680
immutable os variant shipping the gnome

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,440
desktop

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,519
um when that effort came

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,959
came to pass and we started having this

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,560
there was some work by

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:48,639
members of our community to uh

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,000
actually move to offering a version

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,880
of this uh system with kde

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
and we have uh the stuff needed to kind

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,240
of make that

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,839
and like silver blue it'd be using rpm

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,120
os tree for the base os

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,399
and we'd start providing um flat packs

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,000
of kde applications and such

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,600
for applications and ship those

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,399
uh into it and have the fedora toolbox

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,480
environment

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,760
to give you a more mutable shell to run

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,399
things like

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,160
developer tools install command line

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,040
utilities and stuff in a containerized

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
environment

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,639
and all this effort is being tracked in

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,120
the fedora kde sig

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,360
packer project issue tracker so if

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,560
you've got ideas feel free to like

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:39,760
jump in there and and help us out um

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,880
so you know the the big thing is that we

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,399
are trying very hard to offer a

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:50,639
solid experience we're revitalizing

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,639
our um our our

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,160
communications and our active

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,040
development kind of stuff

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,399
and uh we've got our project issue

00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,760
tracker and we've have our mailing list

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,600
in our irc channel i'm looking at

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,639
setting up a matrix room and things like

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,079
that

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,480
um if you

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,360
want to come and help us uh you know

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,639
come join us

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,800
uh we're we'd be happy to to

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,160
have more contributors on to this uh and

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,519
we have cookies and we give them out

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,160
pretty freely

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:25,440
um so yeah uh

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,040
any questions from the group

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,680
uh unfortunately i i timed this for 30

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,079
minutes

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,839
and which means i i made it about half

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,680
as long as i normally did to leave room

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,480
for questions and stuff

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,040
that seems to have possibly been a

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,199
mistake i don't know

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,320
thanks a lot for the talk that was uh

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,639
great to

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
see so much enthusiasm i think we have

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,360
one or two

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,160
questions in the notes um

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,480
so yeah first question do you think that

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,639
if

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,880
this spin or other fedora spins become

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,240
more popular in the future

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:06,160
would it be possible to support power pc

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,839
64 le of course

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,639
i think the only reason we haven't done

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,320
it is because nobody's ever asked for it

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:17,760
we build all the packages for for power

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,199
for system z for arm

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,880
arc 64 for 32-bit arm

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,040
every architecture that fedor supports

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,800
we have plasma software for it

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:32,480
so if you'd like us to offer um

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,800
a power pc 64 le

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,399
please just you know file an issue on

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,240
the sig and let us know

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:43,120
and we can figure out getting that

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,639
um getting that made like it's it's not

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,759
that hard to add another

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,440
another um iso to be produced for

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,880
for those people and i know that the

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
talus ii workstation

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,279
is starting to become a favorite of some

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,639
folks so i'm totally happy to see fedor

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,040
kde on those environment on those

00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,040
systems

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,399
yeah second question if i remember

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,160
correctly plasma is not provided as

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,680
optional desktop environment when

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,680
installing fedora

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,519
and he plan on giving plasma some love

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,920
and proposing it by default as an

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,920
alternative to gnome

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,160
so i think this comes with a little bit

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,880
of a misunderstanding compared to how

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,519
um i i feel like this is probably

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,480
something

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,399
inspired by like how open souza and uh

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,120
debian may actually be presenting the

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,639
desktops

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,519
um in fedora the primary deliverable

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,560
for desktops is uh through live media

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,320
images

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,000
um and there we have the workstation

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,000
edition which shifts gnome

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,240
um i am actually talking to

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,360
uh the website's team about the idea of

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,000
having fedora kde also

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,759
be presented on the at the same level as

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
the workstation edition

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,440
um some of the stats that matthew miller

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,079
shared with us was

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,680
indicated that despite the second level

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,399
marketing like we're on

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,600
we're like below the top level fold we

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,799
are the

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,160
most popular variant of fedora outside

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,520
of gnome

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,120
um and the most popular variant outside

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,480
of the three editions

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,679
uh combined compared to all the other

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,720
ones combined

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,640
so we're popular enough that it is worth

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,919
um you know giving some stronger

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,679
promotion and

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,919
we do and we are release blocking

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,720
variant like fedora does not make a

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,280
release unless

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,720
uh both gnome and kde are fully

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,880
functional and working

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
so it matters to us quite a lot so

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,280
that's something that i would love to

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,640
see and i think we're

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,320
hopefully going to see as we look at

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,520
redesigning the fedora websites and the

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,840
marketing material

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,280
as the rebranding for the the new fedora

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,160
logo and all that stuff starts coming

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,160
down the pipeline

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,440
which yes that's a thing maybe it'll

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,640
happen as soon as

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,039
everything is figured out with

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,400
trademarks and stuff

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,039
nice so we have yeah even four more

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,080
questions

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,960
that's great uh so would it be possible

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,640
to sync fedora kde releases with plasma

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,840
releases

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,000
no plasma releases too frequently

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,520
so the problem with it is that plasma

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,320
releases somewhere between

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,480
three to four months um i i don't

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,480
actually remember the exact cadence

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,679
but it's it's more frequently than

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,919
fedora does

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,679
we do try to line up fedora releases to

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,080
the latest available

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,880
plasma release and our compromise here

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,440
is that

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,039
we actually push updated releases of

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,240
plasma as they release to the latest

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,520
fedora release

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,200
so for example most likely um five

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,840
uh either 519 or 520 hopefully 520 will

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,880
actually be

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,840
in fedor um

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,760
when 521 comes out we will also push it

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,200
to fedora 33.

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,080
that is we try to make the latest plasma

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,080
desktop

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,440
available to the latest fedora stable

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,640
release

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,240
so that you know this slight out of sync

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,919
nature doesn't hurt us too badly

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,600
yeah all right uh then oh people like

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,280
being on the bleeding edge

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,840
do you think it's possible to have a

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,280
repo of kde packages from git

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,400
like opensuse krypton yeah actually yes

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,000
i think this would

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,520
be um a possibility so um

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,280
it actually might even be easier than

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,200
how it's done in opensuse which is a

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
super convoluted process the last time i

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
looked

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,240
um because the dora's packaging is

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,200
actually built in git repos so

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,559
we have src.fedoraproject.org which is

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,200
where all of the packaging

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,919
lives and those are all git repos it'd

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,280
be relatively straightforward to build

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,600
some automation

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,440
so that we can trivially take those

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,559
packaging spec files

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,720
um shimmy the latest get commits or get

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,039
snapshots or whatever we want to do

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,200
and like put that together make a

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,640
nightly weekly monthly something

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,679
composed that

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,679
produces um a a um

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,720
a beta image or something with the

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,159
latest kde

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,200
stuff um we also already do

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,120
um i think it's monthly respins of

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,039
fedora kde so like whenever we do a

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,240
rebase of kd that gets included in a

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,600
monthly respin

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,000
or is it weekly i forget what the

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,320
cadence is but we do reef spins of all

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,320
the

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,480
all the media for all the variants on a

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,480
fairly regular basis and so

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,159
updates get included through that as

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,520
well

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,080
nice okay and two more questions

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,600
at the moment is there a plan to offer

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,640
fedora kde2 hardware providers

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,120
um i don't see we don't currently have

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,919
any plans per se but that's also because

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,640
i don't know what

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,559
how we would do it not that like i'm not

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,679
interested or the or the sig may not be

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,720
interested in it

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,200
but i i literally do not know what that

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,000
process would be to work with a hardware

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,840
uh with the with an ihv who makes

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,480
computers to do that sort of thing

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,240
if someone if someone wants to ship

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,080
fedora kde on a laptop

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,840
like you know maybe the slim book folks

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,600
want to do it for like another kde

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,440
community version or

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,440
um or tuxedo or whatever like

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,880
i really don't have a problem with that

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,240
and i think the rest of us would be fine

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,000
with it as well

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,080
i think the main condition we would have

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,159
is that we don't want

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,200
installed versions to deviate too much

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,520
from fedora

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,640
the fedora official image i mean we're

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,720
this is what we're doing with fedora

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,720
workstation with lenovo they don't

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,400
deviate from our image

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,520
much if at all aside from providing a

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,280
few legal documents that they're

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,320
required to ship on onto

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,679
hardware and i think we basically want

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,039
the same kind of arrangement

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,120
maybe we could talk about some other

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,559
customizations i don't know but that's

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,039
that's basically where i would see it

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,159
would go for that

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,559
nice yeah uh so last question for now

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,520
is their plan to make spins more visible

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,159
on the website

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,799
so it says currently it's basically just

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,840
one square surrounded by lots of others

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,840
so it's easy to miss it yeah i

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,200
i think this is this is definitely

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,640
something we should look at

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,919
for when we when we redo the website so

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,240
like a lot of the

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,720
work that we want to do to rejigger the

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,760
branding the websites the marketing

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,919
has been kind of holed up in the in the

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,600
new fedora logo that is still undergoing

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,679
the legal process of getting trademark

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,240
getting the validations getting all the

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,559
crossing the t's dotting the ice i think

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,720
with that we will probably also look

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:35,520
at making spins and labs more prominent

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,720
in some way um i don't know explicitly

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,799
how we're going to do it

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,080
but i think that we are definitely going

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,600
to have to look at

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,280
making this more visible and more

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,240
prominent because it's unfair to the

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,080
spins and the

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,679
labs who put a lot of work into

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,799
supporting their variants

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,320
that they can't really get any users to

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,919
see it unless they already know it's

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,880
there which is a horrible catch 22.

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,720
yeah well thank you so much for the talk

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,440
oh in the chat there was some back and

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,280
forth about

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,679
butter fs and been happy with it

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,679
personally

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,880
yeah so some people had bad experiences

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,039
and burn their fingers

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,720
some love it oh well i guess time will

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,400
tell how that goes

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,240
thank you so much for your presentation

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,280
