Title: Akademy 2020 - Aniqa Khokhar - Change Management
Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	The world hates change, yet it is the only thing that has brought progress ~ Charles Kettering
Understanding and accepting change is not easy. There have been times where KDE has moved to a new platform and switch was not easy. We need to understand all aspects of change with importance to accept change. We have to understand that change not only gives the organization a significant advantage but it also helps us to progress over others. So, what are the effective ways to manage, accept, and increase acceptance to change?
In this talk, we will improve our capability to understand and manage change. We will learn how to best roll out a change within KDE.

We will be able to:
• understand the critical role of change management
• plan, control, and adjust to change
• create a stronger working relationship with newcomers
• create a culture of accepting changes across the KDE community
• understand the success factors of change

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,280
so

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,800
i'm going to try if my webcam can work

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,840
but yes it is

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,080
apologies for the internet connection

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,080
okay so i want everyone to cross their

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,519
arms not because it's going to be a

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,439
lecture or something

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,039
but it's an experiment that we want to

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,679
try so

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,960
please cross your arms and uh this

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,160
presentation is going to be really

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,480
interactive so i really want you guys to

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,840
do what i'm going to ask you to do it

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,640
and

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,960
before going uh to the next slide i want

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,760
you to tell me what do you think change

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,079
means

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,360
i know everybody knows the definition

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,520
but if you can just

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,160
write the definition in the chat it will

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,160
be perfect

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,960
so i really want everyone to write what

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,960
do they think change means

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,840
yes with arms crossed

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,360
okay so there are very interesting

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,799
definitions an opportunity for things to

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,080
get either better

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,360
or worse so let's see what the next

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,520
slide says

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,560
according to oxford dictionary an actor

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,960
process through which

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,880
something becomes different so basically

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,119
it's an accurate process

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,840
i am not trying to say that

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,119
it's something that you guys don't know

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,159
obviously you know it

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,840
but it's just that we really want to

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,880
redefine the definition

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,880
of what change is

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,200
so now again i'm going to ask you to

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
change your arms if you right like to

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,719
put your

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,439
arms on your right right hand on your

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,000
left arm

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,560
so do the opposite so that we can see

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,160
how do you feel

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
so change the direction of your arms

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,000
i'm going to ask you in a while how are

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,760
you going to feel because then we're

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,239
going to do another experiment

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
so before change management i would like

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,360
to ask you

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
actually to recall when you were in

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
school

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
in fact i'm sure your parents must have

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,800
shared these kind of stories that when

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,480
you were in preschool how did you feel

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
when you were going to the school

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,000
did you cry on your first day or were

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,360
you happy

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,200
i am definitely sure that

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,959
a lot of people were not happy and they

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,720
were crying

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,480
that's the same scenario when you move

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,080
from school to high school some people

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
are really excited for the change

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,000
some people are sad because they are

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,560
going to lose their friends

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,480
and um when you move from your college

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,959
to professional life

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,599
how was it your first day in the office

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,760
just think

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,599
your first day i'm sure a lot of people

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,480
have not started their professional

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,280
lives

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,280
but if anyone can just relate to it

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,720
okay so how about changing your phone

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,519
have you guys changed your phone

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,640
recently

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,760
or in your life what was the feeling

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,720
were you excited of course if you were

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,560
moved to a little uh i would say

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,040
degraded one or a lower

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,440
uh phone then you must have felt awkward

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,200
but if you upgraded your phone you must

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,360
have felt really nice

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,040
changing your house changing your cities

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,480
if you would ask me right now i've

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
changed my house and my

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,120
city country everything so it's a very

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,319
different change for me

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,760
so another change which i felt right now

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:59,439
is that i've moved too fast and

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,760
how did i feel about first topic but

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,720
just imagine that when you come to a new

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,439
organization

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,360
it's very different right so if a

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,439
newcomer comes to kde

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,799
try to imagine how that person feels try

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,200
to be me

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,720
that how was the feeling to be part of

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,600
foster community

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,400
particularly when i joined i heard about

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,160
gitlab

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,720
and git lab when it was migrating to

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,639
gitlab

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,919
a lot of people loved fabricator and

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,720
they really didn't want to move to

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,040
gitlab

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,639
and i'm sure that it was an awkward

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,040
feeling and it took long

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,040
really long for you to accept this fact

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,440
so why do we hate change um i would

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
really want you to write that why do you

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,240
want to

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,240
why do you hate change so start typing

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,000
why do you hate change

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,600
a lot of people these are not something

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,680
which i am saying

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
but a lot of theories have said that

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,880
people hate change

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,960
because they believe that they are going

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,960
to give up on their beliefs

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,280
because they are really loyal to their

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,240
beliefs do you remember your mother

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,080
if she bought some brand and even your

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,680
wife or yourself

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,000
and all the females or all the

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
gentlemen who have bought new brands of

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,759
i would say

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,759
food or clothes you were a little

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,280
nervous about it because you were used

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
to your old brands

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,160
because you were loyal to it sometimes

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,280
you feel surrendered to someone

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,600
you really don't want to go for it

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,600
so there are mixed feelings you feel

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,400
feared you feel guilty you

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
are in doubt

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,120
i know the word hates change but this is

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,320
the only way

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,320
you can progress so you really need to

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,639
start thinking how can you actually

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,639
change

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
okay right now i'm asking you guys if

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,680
you want to just

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,520
uh don't want to cross your arms it's

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,880
fine but i'm sure it must have been

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,759
super awkward

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,160
because change is here trust me it's

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,800
your mind how you actually train it

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,400
so what are the benefits of change now

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,120
we are going to move towards it

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,199
if we were talking about hate now we are

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,319
going to talk about change

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,160
so basically if you think

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,800
this is a very nice picture if you see

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,680
that change is basically a chance

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,160
so it can help you promoting new skills

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,479
um

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,840
i'm sure a lot of people can relate here

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,960
when we moved from

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,880
um fabricator to get that learned a new

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,919
skill you learned a new software you

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,360
learned a new environment

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,240
it helps innovation and it also allows

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
you to progress

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:51,280
so before you are in such a situation

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,840
think about uh how do you feel yourself

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,120
when you are in such circumstances do

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,599
you think that you are doing

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,360
a right thing according to this picture

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,160
these people are thinking that maybe

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,319
something

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,000
will happen and they don't have to

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,960
change but trust me

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,039
without change you cannot move in life

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,840
this is a cycle of change

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,319
if something is constant and you need

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
you will

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,160
feel a dip and a transition and you will

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
feel really bad about it

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,080
but then there's a new beginning always

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,360
and again because change

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,199
is not constant every time everything

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,759
has to change and that's how the world

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,759
is moving

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,240
so now we'll come back to the main point

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,160
that how

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,360
going to actually accept change

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,919
accepting change is uh

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,039
as i've just read the comments that

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,759
somebody has read

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,840
written that you cannot actually think

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,520
that changes are always better i agree

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,960
totally and i'm going to talk about that

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,599
as well right now

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,919
so you need to acknowledge the change it

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,879
did not mean that you have to like

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,199
choose or support just try to understand

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,720
what

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,919
is the change why is it and why do you

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,599
need to change

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,000
try to be flexible try to embrace it

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,160
as i said changes constantly it's going

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,520
to come again and again in your life you

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,800
are going to

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,360
change you think that you are not

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,919
changing

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,039
trust me you as i told you that how your

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,639
school life changed how your

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,319
professional life changed

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,039
everything is changed so if you feel

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,039
that

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,039
you're not going to change express it

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,039
express your fears and the feelings

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,120
communication is the key of success so

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,159
you really need to communicate

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,560
and the i would say the best thing is to

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,839
be optimistic about it if from the

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,760
beginning you're thinking that

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,360
it's not going to work out it will not

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,680
work out so you really

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,600
really need to have a positive feeling

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
about it you need to have a positive

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,200
attitude

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,120
also you really need to understand that

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,720
it's an active process it's not

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,920
something which we are going to just

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
discuss right now in

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,839
20 minutes and you will start doing it

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,399
and you will learn change management

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,519
not at all because it's actually a long

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,760
long process

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,080
it will go on and on so you need to

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,320
start changing your attitude towards

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,320
experience people ideas

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,880
okay so that was a side where we talked

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,800
about accepting the change

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,000
what if you are on the opposite side and

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,519
you are implementing

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,440
the change so what are you going to do

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,360
first of all you need to start with the

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,800
end in mind you need to think that okay

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,920
this is something which we

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,200
are going to do now currently we are

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,680
talking about kde

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,240
so if you are thinking to start a new

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,600
project

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,640
or if you have a new task understand

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,480
kde's culture

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,399
understand the organization's culture

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,360
where you're going to implement it

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,880
how people are going to react to it

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
again in this way

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,880
in this method also you need to

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,640
communicate communicate communicate

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,399
if you are not going to communicate the

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,839
benefits to the people they would never

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,839
understand i don't know if um

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,920
in your school it happened or not but i

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,160
remember my teacher she appointed

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,959
most naughty scared in the class as

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,880
monitor

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,399
because she thought that if he will be

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,440
in control the whole class will be in

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,600
control

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,279
so if you think that somebody is there

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,160
who's going to be the most resistant

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,000
person

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,640
try to talk to him first so that he

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
doesn't take the same attitude to others

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,640
so you need to

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,160
uh take him in confidence take him or

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,720
her in confidence

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,279
and if you have some supporters you need

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
to

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,480
understand their values as well and you

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,920
need to

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,160
uh i would say embrace them try to walk

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,680
in their shoes understand why they are

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,079
hating change

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,760
create a win-win situation if i'm

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,839
implementing something in kde and i'm

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,079
just talking about kd's progress

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,519
i need to talk about kt communities

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,279
progress as well

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,839
just can't say that okay if you're going

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,680
to bring this change we will be

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,079
shown over there or somewhere but we

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,760
need to understand how the community can

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,760
also benefit from it

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,839
so the best thing i'm sure the project

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,000
managers with us right now would

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,800
understand this that any project

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,079
is actually divided into small steps and

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,000
it's measurable

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,480
so if you're implementing a change you

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,920
really need to do that

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,320
now i'm going to um

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,600
say uh see a share something really

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,839
interesting with you

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,399
so what are you going to do right now is

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,880
if you have a paper and pen just

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,920
start writing the changes in your life

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,120
you have seen

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,560
if not now then what you can do is that

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,560
whenever after and you think someday

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
or maybe in your life you're going to

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,720
face a change

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,480
and you don't know how to react so you

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,360
are going to use that candy jar and

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,480
you're going to put

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,040
all these in that jar and whenever you

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,040
feel

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,839
that you are not able to accept that

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,040
change you can just read it out

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,440
and trust me this will help you

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,480
and always remember that without

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,920
accepted

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,920
opportunities sleep slip away so um i

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,519
don't know if you guys have heard about

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,240
kodak film uh case kodak was a

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,279
top-notch company when we had film

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,040
cameras

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,000
but when there was an industry

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,760
revolution all the cameras

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,279
moved to digital cameras and what

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,839
happened kodak

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,560
didn't react at that time and they said

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,920
that me

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,600
the film cameras will be the one in the

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,839
world and it didn't happen complete

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,519
gone from the market they could have

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,279
reacted in a different way

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,639
they could have launched memory cards

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,120
they could have launched anything

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,040
else but they didn't so you could see

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,240
what has happened with kodak

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,800
similarly same thing happened with nokia

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,240
you have seen that android has changed

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,920
the world right now

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,720
and nokia didn't implement the needs

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,160
and nokia has manokia's market share has

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
gone

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,399
so i think if you really want to

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,480
understand

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,800
why change management is important you

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,279
really need to understand

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,279
i would say that you really need to

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,639
understand the critical role of change

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,040
management

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,320
so if you think that you really want to

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,600
implement something

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,760
you can plan you can control and adjust

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,240
do it so create a stronger working

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,399
relationship with newcomers i know that

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
including me i would say paul and your

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,279
futures were really supportive and

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,800
because of them

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,120
i was able to do otherwise

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,720
to be initially when i joined as a

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,720
newcomer in the fast community it

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,680
wouldn't have been easier for me

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,199
so whenever a newcomer comes try to

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,360
understand they are coming from a

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,760
different operating system environment

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,000
it will take time for them to adjust

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,120
it's easy for everyone to come to the

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,760
first environment

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,760
because as i said change is here and we

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,000
have been using certain systems or

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,360
certain processes for a very very long

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,880
time and moving shifting to the process

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,320
is not that easy secondly

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,880
to think that something which is coming

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,639
and it's not good or beneficial for kde

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,120
or community express

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,839
it's okay you really don't have to say

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,839
that

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,240
that okay you don't have to

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,959
uh implement this right now just try to

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
understand

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,800
that why this person is not

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,199
reacting the way you want it so remember

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,560
that

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,839
the success factors of change the person

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,680
i would say is you

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,880
and the person who's implementing so the

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,360
accepted

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,320
element both have to understand why

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,680
change management

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,760
is important so

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,120
in the end i would say accept the things

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,600
you cannot change

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,160
and change the things you can because

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,160
it's

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,519
you the one who would decide either you

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,720
want to go for a new way

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,279
or an old way i think i have

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,959
done my presentation pretty earlier so

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:10,320
if you have any questions

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,320
alison do you want to join absolutely

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,880
thank you so much for that that was

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,680
really

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,680
mind opening

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,720
thank you just trying to get my camera

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,519
back on

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,399
okay all right

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,320
okay so we have a question and it says

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,759
as new to kde

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,759
10.1

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,120
yeah can you point one thing you believe

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:45,120
we should change in order to improve

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,120
oh my god that's a debatable topic

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,519
i think whatever changes i feel i have

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,959
been sharing that

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,639
now and then publicly whatever i felt

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,639
i have shared that in the promo group

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,720
i've shared that

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,839
with everyone so that's not something i

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,040
can say one thing

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,079
or something i think as a community

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,279
katie is impressed that we work all

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,959
along together

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,600
so i really don't think that there's one

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,600
thing i would say

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:21,199
i'd have to agree as all and also

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,199
katie but

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,240
um paul just said how diplomatic i know

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,320
we're just gonna start calling anika the

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,800
diplomat

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:41,199
yeah it's okay that's who i am

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,199
well if there's no more questions

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
maybe there's some in the public chat

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:52,399
yeah we've got lots of great comments

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
though yes because i really wanted to

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,600
keep it interactive because

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,120
change management is not something which

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,120
i can teach as a lecturer

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:07,280
what change would you make to kde

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,000
what i think yeah that's a question in

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,199
the comments

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,160
from jonathan i see yeah

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,520
so i think right now we are working on

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,640
kde

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,959
and i really want that to work out

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,959
and that's for you as well alison

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,240
go ahead oh me i'm a swat it's not my

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,840
talk

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,600
paul just said that i didn't say

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,400
anything he's just written good question

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
for alison too

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,840
so we have another question maybe some

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,679
quick poll about the gitlab

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,679
change that me too

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,080
up to you if you would like to host yes

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,960
yes

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,440
so how are you excited or not excited

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,440
let's see

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,480
okay adam says how to do change when it

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,400
affects

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,919
a lot of people like a community

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,720
okay so as i said that you really can't

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,360
change something overnight you really

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,919
need to

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,440
understand the dynamics of the community

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,720
and you need to

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:22,000
show them how beneficial it is for them

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,400
not the way uh you pursue it

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,360
right if you think that your perception

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,120
is the same way

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,640
it's not because trust me the other

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,720
person who's going to

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,840
receive the change will not take it so

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,600
you really need to

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,880
do it in a way that the whole community

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,559
and if you think that whole community

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,400
can be happy it cannot be

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,840
you really need to go with authority and

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,640
you have to try to show them the

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,600
positivity

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,559
i hope i answered adam's question i

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,640
think so

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,720
he can always answer follow-up he says

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,039
yes okay

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,440
has a question for you too he says would

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,400
you say kde is accepting to change

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,440
based on your experience so far and the

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,200
suggestions

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,080
you made what was your experience

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,200
okay that's a long question so i would

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,400
say that yes

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,799
i have seen a lot of changes um like for

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,559
instagram i have started posting a lot

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,200
that was i think the first change which

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,000
i

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,640
tried to implement yes and i said that

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
always

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,840
uh you cannot be right like in my case

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,240
as well

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,919
if i am um saying that okay this is

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,880
something which should be changed maybe

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,720
i'm wrong

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,320
so i need to even understand that

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,640
whether i'm right or wrong

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,799
so the other thing which i said is about

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,559
kde network and i was very happy that

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,080
everybody was really receptive and

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,240
supportive about it

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,160
so i would say my experience experience

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,960
has been really good up till now

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,200
and trust me it shows on my face it even

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,280
though

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,360
i'm diplomatic my show's on my face if

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,280
i'm not happy

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,480
all right adam asks anika what is your

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,360
hardest change how did you handle it

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,880
okay so right now is my heart has

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,240
changed to be honest because

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,600
i have um i'm living here all alone my

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,559
family's in pakistan

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,600
and i've changed my country i've moved

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,640
from my family

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,120
so yes it's the hardest change right now

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,760
and there was corona so i was all alone

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
in this house

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:24,720
i feel you pain

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,600
um says as a follow-up i think

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,919
so we should be accepting to proposals

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,039
for

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,000
change as well and adam is sending

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,960
virtual hugs

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,960
and so is paul thank you so much

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,120
uh we do have time or are we done we

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,960
have a couple more minutes

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,799
so we can answer more questions i think

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,120
that's like a really interactive session

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,080
trust me because i really didn't think

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,480
that it will end so soon although i had

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,640
an internet coach as well

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,360
well i think that's okay because

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,559
everyone more time to interact with you

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,840
what do you miss from windows i've never

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,039
worked for windows so

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,559
yes windows operating system i miss it

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,240
of course because

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,240
um as i said the change is here right so

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,520
it's very difficult for me i am in the

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,559
transition phase right now

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,440
from windows to plasma so the only thing

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,440
which i miss

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,000
paul you know is that the mic thing

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,120
because whenever i turn the mic

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,799
on my plasma it just disturbs me

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,200
so that's the only thing which i miss in

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,720
the windows

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,240
we have a comment that says you've been

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,640
doing great on promo and that is

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,840
something i absolutely agree a thousand

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,159
percent

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,559
thank you so much we have another

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,799
question maybe our last question

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,799
how do you gather quality feedback from

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,679
those who are being asked to undergo a

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,919
change

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,840
i.e polls focus groups etc

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,760
okay so it totally depends on the

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,960
community if you think that your

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,320
community

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,080
is uh to be honest receptive or

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,080
intellectual enough to go for a focus

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,840
group um you can go for a focus group

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,880
and if you think that polls will be much

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,799
easier for them

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
so you can go for polls because see it

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,919
depends if you are

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,600
from a technical side or a non-technical

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,720
side and if you are going to ask a

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,120
non-technical person about technical

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,280
in the focus group it will not be easy

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,440
so you really need to understand

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,720
uh i wouldn't say that there will be one

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,360
exact measure for

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,559
community you need to have you have to

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,200
see what academics are

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,320
i hope that answers i don't know let's

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,840
see if

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,840
hudson sends anything

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:50,320
yes maybe

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,320
i said believe so and thank you thank

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,600
you

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,600
