Title: Akademy 2020 - Ambady Anand S - Free Software Press Freedom KDE
Publication date: 2020-11-24
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	Story of Janayugom, the first newspaper in the world to use 100% free software for pre-press processes and how KDE played an important role in it.

Janayugom is a local daily newspaper in Kerala with 100k readers. In a time where press freedom is under threat, local newspapers are struggling to survive. The increasing subscription cost of various proprietary software adds even more burden. This presentation is about how free software came to their rescue and how KDE & Plasma Desktop helped in the migration. It also includes the story of Scribus and Janayugom Edit - a Qt based ASCII to Unicode converter and text editor.

[Music]

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,520
hi everyone my name is

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,920
ambadi and i'm here to talk about

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,920
free software press field and kde

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,680
first i will introduce myself

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,320
i'm basically working as a full stack

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,320
web developer and i'm also a programmer

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,760
i work at a company called alpha fog

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,239
technologies

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,120
it's located in a small state of

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,120
caroline india

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,760
i'm also a member of the software

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,480
community of india

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,160
you can compare ssi to prime software in

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,680
france

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,840
we provide price respecting

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,399
services so we promote free software in

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,640
india

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,199
coordinating various researcher

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,199
communities

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,119
so the main topic of my topic uh is

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,119
about a newspaper in kerala it's called

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,479
we speak a language called malayalam in

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,479
the state of kerala

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,799
it's the reagan paper it's owned by cpa

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,840
kerala state committee

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,840
political party

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:41,840
it has almost about 100k readers

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:41,840
and it is founded in 1947

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
so talking about the background of the

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,439
story uh

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,799
it started with the general papers

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,000
decision

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:59,040
to migrate to a

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,880
newly advanced technology stack

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,600
so the main reason for this is because

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,040
of their increasing cost of propriety

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,520
software

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,959
they weren't able to continue their work

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,440
so they were looking for alternative

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,440
solutions

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
there were also other reasons such as

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,239
unfriendly government policies

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,200
it was interrupting there

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,840
industry as you can see in 2019

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,000
reporters without borders has ranked

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,840
india 140 out of 180 countries in the

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,920
first freedom index

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,680
actually it's very pathetic situation

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:50,879
newspaper and other media

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:54,239
trying hard to survive

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:58,159
so the first session of general was to

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,760
switch to adobe indesign

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,280
they already used startup page maker

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
before

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
but as i said the increasing cost

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,159
prevented them

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,200
so checking for alternatives uh they

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,440
ended up with a

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,920
free software artist called praveen

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,040
admiratory

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,239
who suggested them to use scribers and

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,239
that's how they came to meet us

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,840
as you can see in the photo this is the

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:33,840
generation

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:33,840
free software project migration team

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,239
this is the old software stack they used

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,239
it consisted of microsoft windows

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,159
and ask e2 unicode converter tool

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,080
called type it which only works on

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,920
windows

00:03:50,080 --> 00:04:01,840
they also have other adobe tools such as

00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:01,840
page maker and photoshop

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,319
um so what we decide what we

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,840
suggested them is to use free software

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,200
instead

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,599
of course including drivers instead of

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,680
just switching only the

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,759
type setting software we also suggested

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,240
them to change the index stack including

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:28,000
operating system and the primary choice

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,560
of kde based ubuntu

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
or kubundu

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,000
[Music]

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,560
we suggested that we could develop a

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,960
custom distro for them

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,960
based on this kubuntu um

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,240
we just open to 19.04

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,199
consisting plus my desktop subscribers

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,000
and we added a software called january

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,000
made it

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,639
previously i mentioned type it right

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,639
so as an alternative for it to working

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,240
do linux we developed our own

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,479
from scratch a

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,440
ask you to unicode converter and it's

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,160
called general made it

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,400
and we also added dim and escape to the

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,400
stack

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,199
and these are the other softwares uh it

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,720
includes kate

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,280
killer firefox libreoffice playing for

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
kura

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,800
actually they were very happy with the

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,440
new software stack if they have been

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
introduced to

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,639
so let me get a little bit back not a

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,720
story

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,199
this is kh hussein from kerala

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,440
he used to design various custom unicode

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,039
fonts

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
so in this project his role was to

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,880
design three different

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,080
unicode phones for general

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:01,520
till then they only used this

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,120
key which was in you know uh page maker

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
which didn't support unicode

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,400
this cage hussein we call him hussein

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,919
master

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,919
along with our shogun master it was them

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,800
who

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,120
contacted us regarding this migration

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,120
project

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,960
uh as they

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,280
are being designed wasn't affordable uh

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,120
they consulted susan master first

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,520
and that's why kumar he's also from

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,960
kerala who has more than four decades of

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,880
expertise in that of type setting

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,919
so they came to know about scribes from

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,600
praveen and they contacted us

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,160
like i said before we suggested them

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,039
subscribers and

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:54,800
a kubuntu basic software stack

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,800
um our team also consists of

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,960
these members as you can see in the

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,639
picture right now

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,560
talking from left most it is khan man

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,080
right next to him with the one bag here

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,800
she is called sarnia

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,919
and the one behind her is ranjit city

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,440
and next to him

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,000
is ashokan master and the one in the

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,440
center with

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,560
white white shirt is rajaji matthew

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,560
and we have mujib me and hussein master

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,520
on the photo this is a core team

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,919
who worked behind this migration project

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,880
uh

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,479
khan ranjitsuji muji and embody we were

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,479
together in alpha 4 technologies

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,319
as i said the migration also included

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,280
migration from ascii to

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,319
unicode as well uh three different fonts

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,400
were developed

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
called tn joy are sugan

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,240
which consists of you know

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,120
exclusive character set in malayalam

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,879
unlike in

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,879
ascii which didn't have that option

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:19,759
coming to the voice but

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:22,160
why we choose kde the main reason is uh

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,039
to be flying it's a familiar ui you know

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,639
windows people

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,120
really find it easy to use kde

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,000
it's very user friendly and it also

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,039
provides

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,640
a lot of customization features and

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,159
scribe was the main software they use

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,240
for type setting it is in qt

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:43,279
and kde integrates well with qt

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,279
the custom ascii unicode software we

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,640
developed it also works in

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,640
virtual qt

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,640
and kd provides plasma widgets which is

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
another cool feature

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,360
so what we customized a lot

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,279
is regarding around the plasma theme we

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:13,040
customized it to make it unique

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,040
to give the branding for geneva

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,839
the boot animation from boot animation

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,920
to a wallpaper and

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,880
you know and their team reaching their

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,440
lock

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,720
to match the branding of the new game

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,760
and they were very

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,279
happy with it the plasma splash screen

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,880
sdm login team icon team custom menu

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,839
icon team

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:41,279
we almost redesigned and there

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,920
look and feel to make it look more

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,920
unique to them

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,959
and one of the cool features they like

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,640
most is dolphin

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,320
dolphin features as you know

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,240
it was entirely new to them to

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,080
experience the table browsing in a file

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,720
manager

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:07,920
on one side we show the demo with the

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,600
uh firefox and they compared it to

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,440
uh adults in sharing the tab

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,200
have the browsing free feature and all

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,200
with the same shortcuts you know ctrl t

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,480
to open a new tab ctrl w to close it

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,959
control shift t open so

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,640
recently close the tab and they were

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,560
very happy with it

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,280
and the split view was really helpful to

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
them

00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,760
[Music]

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
you know working with the two different

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,320
directories at a time switching is very

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,480
easy with a split view

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,880
the file preview even text files can be

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,880
previewed

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,040
they work with text files most so you

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,760
know the content for newspaper it is

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,120
easy to

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,680
preview before opening it express

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,480
and a couple of additional features we

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,839
added

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,839
is service menus

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,399
for example to edit images and pdf files

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,640
so we added extra service menu to make

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,959
it very easy for them

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:07,279
and the network options with the dolphin

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,279
to access remote files that is also very

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
handy

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,079
this is a public announcement photo

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,839
before explaining about that let me

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,959
say a little more about this background

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,640
story of scribers

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,079
many of many of you may have been

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,519
already

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,760
familiar with it right this is a

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,480
cross-platform free and open source

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,160
software for desktop publishing

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,360
usually uh means

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,120
before some time it didn't support

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,360
many languages such as malayalam we use

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,360
here

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,639
there was a project called host a man

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,160
headed by hadal sabi who introduced

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,920
non-latin language support with a you

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,079
know homeless test layout inscribers

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,120
that really helped us a lot

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,920
because only after that we were we were

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,399
able to use

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,519
malayalam inscribers without that this

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,839
whole project would have

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,360
been even possible so i would like to

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,680
thank richard fire the

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,880
father and then their posterman team for

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,480
their valuable contribution to

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,160
subscribers actually that is a beauty of

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:25,839
free software you know

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,839
people can add features missing

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,320
and the project we took almost one month

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,360
to complete the training session

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,480
for about 100 staff

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
it was hands-on session

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,079
we took it in three batches

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,120
everyone went fine because they were

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,000
already familiar with the desktop

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,160
publishing

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,320
system so it was very hard to train them

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,320
the only issue is with the

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,680
changing look and feel but as i said the

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,200
kde made it

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,200
the transition very easy

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,880
apart from just giving training

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,360
regarding the

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,720
you know software stack we already we

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,560
also introduced them the philosophy of

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,600
free software

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,519
and we even recommended to upload the

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:34,639
images and you know

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:38,160
contribute to wikipedia wikileaks

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,480
talked about creative commons license

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,480
and all

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,639
we also gave some training in uh basic

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,639
you know this pro

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,399
how to interact with the desktop

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,199
environment

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,199
ending escape

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,839
there were some couple of issues

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,839
regarding hardware and all because

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,839
you know not all for we don't have free

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,279
software drivers for our

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,839
hardware out there you know so we had

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,839
some issues

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,399
some of muslim we fought by checking

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,160
many online forums and all

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,839
but some we couldn't fix and we

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:31,839
suggested them to buy new software

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,839
excuse me

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,639
so after everyone got trained in using

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,600
subscribers

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,760
um we went for a pilot period of one

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,240
month

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,320
where they slowly transitioned page by

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,680
page

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,120
each week so it was actually a

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,240
combination of tribus and

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,240
adobe for some time

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,680
once they were confident enough to

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
switch completely to scribus

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,560
we run for another week and it is on

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,920
november 1st

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,920
uh the official announcement

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,440
was done and it was by

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,720
chief minister of kerala mr pinner ivy

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,240
james as you can see in the photo

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,920
he announced the migration to free

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,920
software stack and unicode event

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,720
and we didn't support

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:46,720
using you know proprietary platforms

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,920
whether it be social media or even for

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,519
personal

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,440
you said so what we did instead

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:58,560
for promoting the event

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,839
was to share the post across the free

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,120
software

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,399
based social media platforms such as

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,160
you know diaspora and mastodon

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,160
we didn't even have a twitter account

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,720
actually it is the master dice for a

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,720
post that you can see here

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,839
and we also share the content in

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,399
and even kd officially shared it

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,040
we were very happy with it that's how we

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,160
got

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,160
real exposure you know

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,680
we got also featured on hacker news and

00:16:48,399 --> 00:17:04,640
what made me happy more is officially

00:16:51,680 --> 00:17:06,319
shared the story

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,799
this is the general stuff after the

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,079
first training batch

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:15,520

people from different industries across

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,079
industry

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,039
mainly to discuss about the future of

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,960
this project

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,360
uh many were very really interested

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,640
even kepler government offered support

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,640
to continue with this project

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,799
it is a kerala media academy who

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,799
organized it with today's submit

the submit was inaugurated by fahad

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,880

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,600
needed

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,840

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,320
one experience i would like to share is

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:22,640
as soon as we filed a bug report

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,240
we got a patch to fix it in

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
you know overnight you know overnight

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,840
patch we were

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,840
able to fix the bat predict the bug

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,840
the submit also became the venue for the

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,559
formation of a

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,559
consortium

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:45,280
with the above mentioned

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,840
representatives and i.t experts to

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,240
promote self-reliance in publishing

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,520
the consortium also promised to raise

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,520
funds for further developments

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,720
and we really wish we can implement this

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,360
in

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:06,400
various other newspaper

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:11,840
so that you know free software

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,840
we can expect many

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,400
in newspapers

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,840
so that's the story of geneva

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,400
we hope this inspired many newspapers to

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
come from

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,520
come forward to switch to free software

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:39,840
and

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:39,840
we will be always happy to help

so i hope my time is over

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,679
the remaining session is left for

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,559
question and answer

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,280
hi everybody that was a great inspiring

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,520
talk

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,600
i would really like to mention this to

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,480
the audience that he was so not well but

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,960
he still gave

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,640
a great talk so applause for that great

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,320
work

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,320
we have a few questions which i'll be

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,360
reading out

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,840
sure the first question is that stocks

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,480
seem to be focusing more on dtp

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,600
aspects do you have online service

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,960
integration such as

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:37,440
google amp or news aggregator services

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,280
sorry no currently there is no online

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,200
integration but

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,120
we are also we are also working on a

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,600
project called a new flow

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,520
management software it will have this

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,919
cloud integration feature and all but

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,200
we are not planning to integrate google

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,200
imp

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,799
we won't you would like to keep it uh

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,640
free software

00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,480
only okay another question

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,880
would you mind sharing the action

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,360
scripts they could be handy even for

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,360
blogging

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,760
uh actually we haven't developed any

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,799
action scripts yet

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,400
we host our and their uh you know we

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,919
haven't

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,440
even tried the full uh

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,919
you know the software and as i said uh

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,159
the distro was based on kubundu

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,360
uh but we haven't uh shared the rapport

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,960
with uh

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,200
you know the actual uh

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,280
code needed to build the distro instead

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,960
uh

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,600
we shared the uh whatever we customized

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,880
in a repo

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,159
so that one can follow it and

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,280
customize customizations they like

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,120
because even if you share uh

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,960
you know it contains the branding of

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,520
general manager there is no issue with

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,919
sharing

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,120
uh the only issues you will have to

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,120
remove branding from it

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,159
so we just said

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,640
tutorial tube into the custom distro as

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,159
they like

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,400
with all the customizations which have

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,000
made it is documented it is available in

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,880
git dot for community a custom

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,640
github for a custom gitlab instance

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,320
hosted by free software community of

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,559
india

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,919
back to the question sorry that we don't

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,480
have any action scripts to

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,480
share now

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:31,039
okay fine the last question any hard

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,480
challenges you faced during this project

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,640
uh yes actually the first

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,559
challenge was to make the staff

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,400
confident that they can switch to

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,240
a new software a new software stack

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,559
because everyone was

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,320
you know familiar with the software

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,600
which they have been using for almost

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,120
uh 10 to 15 years you know it is really

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,720
hard for them to sustain use

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,520
of their stack one day so uh

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,720
so preparing the staff to work with the

00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,360
new software cycle was the main

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,120
challenge

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,440
and after we were able to show a demo

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,320
they were really

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,159
you know started to gain confidence and

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,360
it was

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:16,080
relatively easy for them to

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,240
migrate and some other challenges he

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,520
faced was regarding

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,440
hardware support for you know many

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,280
hardware doesn't support free software

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,679
drivers and all

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:32,320
uh so some printers gave us some

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,320
issues you know

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,760
and apart from that

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,080
uh everything went fine

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,760
uh and there is also issue with uh you

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,039
know scribers is not yet

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,000
fully uh you know we can compare it with

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,000
adult in design

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,240
it still needs a lot of document and we

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,360
are working on that we

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,039
have a matrix room with the scribes

00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,600
developers we are discussing the changes

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,279
we need

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,720
and they are very friendly and i hope

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:10,559
it will become advanced

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,240
tools we hope it's the same too

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,080
thank you so much ambadi thank you for

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:19,840
