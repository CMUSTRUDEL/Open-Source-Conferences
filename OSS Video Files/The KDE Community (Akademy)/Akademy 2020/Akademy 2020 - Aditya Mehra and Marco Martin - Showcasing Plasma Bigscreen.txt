Title: Akademy 2020 - Aditya Mehra and Marco Martin - Showcasing Plasma Bigscreen
Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	Television sets have evolved from dumb boxes to interactive interfaces and intelligent screens driven by content from the cloud with support for voice assistance but all behind closed platforms, Plasma Bigscreen project is the open platform alternative providing interfaces and features similar to today's closed Smart TV Boxes, This talk will take you through the various features of Plasma Bigscreen and the technology that powers this open experience.

Television sets have been around for decades, from being small TV sets receiving grainy content in its early years to ultra-high-definition large screen displays beaming content from all over the world, TVs have changed a lot in the past hundred years. With the evolution of TVs through the past decade, the experience of static viewing of cable-driven content has evolved into an interactive content-driven experience powered by the world wide web, powerful embedded SOCs and the growing need of wanting to use that large screen for simply more activities has laid the platform for what we call today as "Intelligent TVs".

While the world is adapting to these "Intelligent TVs", The platforms that power the experience are still produced within walled proprietary gardens with a constant threat to User Privacy and User personal data embezzlement that creates the need for having more open platforms. The Plasma Bigscreen project is aimed towards supporting this open platform vision providing interfaces and features similar to today's closed Smart TV Boxes all powered by Plasma, Kirigami, and KDE Frameworks with a touch of Mycroft's open-source voice assistance platform bundled together to provide an experience beyond basic content consumption.

In this talk, we will take you through the various features of the current Plasma Bigscreen raspberry pi 4 image release, the technology that powers this experience and how as an application developer you can expand your applications to the Bigscreen with a look into key navigation that supports application navigation using a reduced number of input keys. This talk will also showcase voice applications and how Mycroft Interacts with the bigscreen environment and what's next on the line for this project.

[Music]

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,200
there it is

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,080
hey there i am mycroft i want to use

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,279
plasma on my big screen tv

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,680
how about at little voice apps here

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,000
at little traditional applications there

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,519
a bunch of kcms everywhere

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,599
and we have your plasmid screen

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,359
experience ready for use

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,800
now let's see one of my voice apps in

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,120
action

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,260
hey micro show me what's trending on

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,260
[Music]

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
youtube

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,199
glad that works now how about browsing

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,840
the web

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,840
let's try that with a remote instead

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,600
let's check out wikipedia

00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:13,760
[Music]

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,170
some scroll down

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,290
some scroll up

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,290
[Music]

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,640
and back to home

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,200
that was amazing let's now learn more

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,200
about plasma big screen from my team

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,119
okay uh how

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,840
i do get back to the presentation

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,840
or i do have to

00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,569
[Music]

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,520
okay i have to upload the presentation

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:08,319
again

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:23,840
i think so

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:23,840
so so so so i do have

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,040
okay here we are on the presentation

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,280
again

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,280
um

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,879
so uh you you just seen

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,920
um uh some feature of uh

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,120
plasma big screen so as you seen

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:52,480
is a big media center uh

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,480
which is a um

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,680
which is meant to run on a tv

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,200
uh our reference hardware is a raspberry

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,319
pi 4

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,640
um and

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,959
we use it as connected with hdmi

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,959
and

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,840
hdmi and

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,280
uh to the to the tv um

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,200
with a remote control connected to the

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,480
respect by four

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,680
um when uh

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,440
you um

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,840
when you are on a tv uh it's uh very

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,680
different than writing an application

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,400
for the desktop

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,879
because there you have

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,879
only

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,560
only very few inputs so the input is

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,400
very different you don't have mouse and

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,319
keyboard you don't have touch you just

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,080
have a remote control with

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,519
a few uh direction keys uh

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
media keys and not much else recently

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,680
you

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,680
have voice as well and

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,079
and we used also also voice support with

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,560
the minecraft

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,600
voice assistant and some integration

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,639
with it

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,560
uh and also the uh the output

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,560
is is very different it's a very big

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,840
screen but it's very far

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,199
so the information must must be

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,199
really not dense

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,360
plasma big screen is written mostly

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,880
in qt and qml so

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,080
qml with regards to keyboard navigation

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,560
it's very tricky but also

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,560
very powerful if you

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,400
if you follow some rules uh there are

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,600
some

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
old keyboard navigation things that will

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,000
be

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,479
were inserted and

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,720
at the at the beginnings of the camera

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,919
life cycle which is better to not use

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,280
much

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,960
anymore like the keys.forward to uh

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,800
attached event but there are also

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,320
uh new things uh newer things that

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,960
are very useful like navigation

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,759
which i will talk a bit more in detail

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,360
later

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,560
uh this is uh

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,560
our reference

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,639
remote control it's a pretty standard

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,240
thing

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,919
they are pretty cheap they are seen

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,360
as a usb keyboard it has a little usb

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,240
dongle

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,960
so the arrow keys are seen as actual

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,960
arrow keys

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,360
and so on um that makes

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:11,680
it makes really easy to

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,960
implement things that work with it

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,919
it also has an internal microphone

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,840
it's also seen as a usb sound card for

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,440
the microphone which is very

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,680
important it's very important for

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,680
uh

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,319
for the minecraft integration some of

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,039
them also have a kind of wiimote

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,400
gyroscope kind of thing for controlling

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,360
the mouse

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:44,880
but we chosen to not to depend from that

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,479
in plasma big screen as it's at most

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,120
a a nice fallback

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,479
when there is some ui that it's not

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,560
really up to par

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,440
but we want to have a good good ui

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,319
so the workflow interaction of plasma

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,360
big screen

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,840
is very simple you turn on the tv you

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,680
see

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,800
a big full screen of um

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,800
of menu items

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,440
and um

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,759
and then you choose what item to to

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,759
launch

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:30,160
and then you go back now uh

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,759
i don't have much time left so i will uh

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,240
just go uh quickly over things

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,080
so we have some settings done with

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,840
system settings and kcm

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:45,440
which has been optimized

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,840
a lot for keyboard interaction

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,440
the primary user interface is done by a

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,520
plasma a plasma shell

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,639
using plasma nano which is mostly

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,000
a kind of framework to build shells on

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,960
it but it's not a shell

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,520
in itself all you see it's a containment

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,560
uh

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,720
the last thing i want to touch on is the

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,560
camera and key navigation as i

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:15,680
as i said uh use the key navigation

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:19,520
attach property with it you can

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,720
you can specify

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,720
where the focus goes

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,479
when you press up down left right on

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,000
each control

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:37,440
uh so uh it's it's a very verbose

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
uh api but if well used

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,360
you can make key navigation go pretty

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,399
well

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,680
also focus scope

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:52,480
it's a it's a very good thing

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,279
as memorizes with the difference between

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,680
focus and active focus where the focus

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,080
was

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,600
in the last focal scope unfortunately i

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,040
don't have time to

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,600
talk more about it but i will happy to

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,560
answer any question about it now i will

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,600
leave

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,600
the microphone to aditya please take it

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
away

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:36,800
hello oh

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:40,399
hope everyone can hear me

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,839
yeah hi everyone uh i'm alex here and

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,680
today i'm going to be talking about

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,720
voice applications and what's so special

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,839
about voice applications

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,240
so for one voice applications

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,880
aren't your traditional desktop

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,519
applications

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:07,200
they are basically python skills written

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,880
in minecraft they don't draw their own

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,399
window

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:17,600
python voice applications have a qml

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:20,000
user interface and basically

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,519
can provide a different user interface

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,240
for different type of devices without

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,399
having to rewrite the skill

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,399
voice applications can also be served

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,040
over the network

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,640
micro voice builds on being bundled with

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,040
the qml user interface

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,720
and a traditional desktop entry file is

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,920
actually what turns these vanilla

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,279
micro skills into voice applications

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,440
these voice applications are then

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,720
installable from online stores and gain

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,079
the ability to become

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,279
launchable via the big screen launcher

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,360
to support these operations microgui

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,839
application provides a skill launching

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,839
framework

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,360
so let's talk more about what is the

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,440
micro gui and what are micro free skills

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,279
micro skills are generally developed in

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,079
python and provide all the logical

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,640
functioning

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,720
of the voice application these skills

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,360
can then take advantage of the micro

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,040
skill class to perform operations such

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,920
as speaking dialogues

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,839
and sending data over to an enclosure

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,880
microphone closures can be of any type

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,600
of service

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,800
they can be a video service they can be

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,240
an audio service

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,839
or they can be an actually a physical

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,600
device that can

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:38,320
output data from a micro skill

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,519
minecraft gui is both a framework and an

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,760
application

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,800
powered by kirigami and qt the micro gui

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,959
framework provides a skill view in which

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,200
these awesome voice applications display

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,680
their pages

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,720
it additionally also provides provides

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,440
an api

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,040
to talk to micros enclosure api that

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,000
serves as a data pipe

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,200
for skill events gui event triggers that

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,839
are accessible over

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:11,839
micros web socket message bus

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,320
so microscopy's awesome architecture

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,320
personal architecture for displaying

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,399
skill pages and data

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
can take advantage of qt's file

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,440
selectors

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,399
to be able to deploy the same voice

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,320
application

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,000
across multiple platforms with a

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,440
dedicated user interface

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,040
for each platform for example last name

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,360
big screen which is mainly designed to

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,240
work with key navigation

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,600
and usb remotes can use the media center

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,120
file selector

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,959
to display pages and serve qml files

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,240
that support key navigation

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,760
and tile-based user interfaces one could

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,639
also use the android

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,519
file selector for a touch-based

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,600
interface

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,079
for something like an android mobile

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,079
platform

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,560
let's look at some of the history of

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,320
packaging voice applications

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,560
so one of the early implementation

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,720
challenges we faced while working

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,920
on the voice application concept was

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,240
packaging

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,800
micro skills are traditionally lived

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,279
inside and author's git repository

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
which have been generally only installed

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,040
by

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,600
the skill command line interface using

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,519
repository links provided by authors

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,519
we wanted to make this process much

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
simpler by providing a graphical user

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,000
interface

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,079
utility and that's how the skill

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,519
installer was born

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,040
one of the concepts was to have a

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,800
central location for listing all the

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,760
voice skills and applications without

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,079
actually searching

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:51,440
for github and forum links for reposting

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,959
there are voice apps or voice skills

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,560
it was then we figured that we could

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,160
actually utilize the awesome playing

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,279
store and the ocs api

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,199
to achieve this the micro skill

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,480
installer is a graphical front end to

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,040
micros own

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,480
skill manager command line utility it

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,160
provides support for

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,720
ocs enabled api stores that can link

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,680
their

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:19,760
data to the skill installer

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,600
authors can add voice applications by

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,000
listing them under the minecraft apps

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,680
category on the playing store

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,120
voice applications listed on the playing

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,839
store by the authors

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,519
then provide the graphical user

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,440
interface kill meta information

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,639
like which branch the installer should

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,480
use or

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,320
if the voice applications need any

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,600
specific system dependencies

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,959
installed to work correctly this creates

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,160
a much cleaner installation and

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,480
distribution experience

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,600
for both the users and voice application

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
voice skill developers

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,240
moving on let's talk about skills with

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,160
the home page

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,920
home pages provide that traditional

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,920
application experience when using

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,000
non-voice input methods

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,680
to voice applications home pages are

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,920
like an entry point to the voice

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,560
application they provide a central

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,639
interface

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,120
for controlling the voice application

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,880
either via key integrated key navigation

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,639
or via voice navigation home pages are

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,800
also required to tell the skill

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,240
desktop entry file which skill pages

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,320
should be displayed

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,040
when opening a voice application from

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,040
the launcher

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,560
so voice applications are really easy to

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,040
get started with

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,600
with all one needs is a basic idea of

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,639
what they

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,480
would like the application to do

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,519
this can be as complex as interacting

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,600
with video service library apis online

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,560
displaying hundreds of playable movies

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,079
that can be made

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,759
interactive through a conversational

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,399
style voice interface

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,440
or can be a simple displaying images

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,959
gallery

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,480
or speaking quotes from some website

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,480
one can refer to the detailed

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,240
documentation with examples for plasma

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,399
big screen website

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,959
and microsoft documentation site to read

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,279
about developing your first gui enable

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,040
voice application using the micro gui

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,800
framework

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,399
micro gui framework also provides a

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
bunch of templates to help you get

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,120
started

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,199
with making simple skills and the

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,759
freedom of qml is not only limited to

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,480
these

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,160
templates the power to explore what

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,480
voice applications can be made

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,519
to do is only limited to one's own

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,920
creativity

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,560
and plasma big screen users would surely

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,959
be glad to have more of them

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,199
please feel free to drop into plasma big

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,759
screen telegram channel for more updates

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,279
discussions or any help regarding voice

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:51,839
applications

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,839
thank you um we're good for questions

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:05,839
uh it doesn't seems to be

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,839
questions not yet

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:13,039
so we can fill up a bit

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,480
the time by going a bit more

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,720
in details yeah sure you can

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,559
you still have seven minutes yeah but

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,760
but but please uh

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,400
feel free to do any question uh about

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,160
um yes everyone if they you have

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,559
questions please share it in the shared

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,799
notes so i can let them know

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,919
okay uh people attendees are asking for

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,360
some demo

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,600
is that possible at the moment uh i

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,120
don't think at the moment aditya do you

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,480
have something

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,880
uh set up not really not right now

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,880
okay

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,320
so the the nearest uh the nearest to a

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,520
demo

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,039
right now i think is the is the

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:03,600
video that we posted in at the beginning

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:06,960
which i am

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:11,679
posting a url now in the chat

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:16,240
um so uh that

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:19,520
that video has actual um

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,960
actual screens and actual interaction of

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,240
uh plasma big screen uh

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,200
the kind of a bit robotized voice there

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,400
there is a

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,840
in the in the foreground is the actual

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,440
voice

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:39,039
of minecraft that has just been

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,240
modified to actually uh

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:45,120
to to speak a description of the video

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,760
but it is the voice that you will hear

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,360
when you

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,400
interact with it uh in the

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,240
microsetup there are a couple of three

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,799
or four different voices that you can

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,799
choose from

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,200
so yeah in the in

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,880
in in the end we chose to do a very

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,480
a very simple and basic thing for now uh

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,840
partly also because uh we think

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,880
that experience of watching a tv is not

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,640
much

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,520
using the chrome that there is around

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,400
but it's actually watching the stuff so

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,640
um i'm so sorry mark couldn't interrupt

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,000
you but we have a few questions

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,160
okay perfect uh the first question is

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,679
what's the base system and how do i

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,440
install it on a five four

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,720
okay so we have uh now

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,480
an image on uh uh

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:50,080
based on neon um

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,679
and i will post

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:57,200
later in the chat a link to the

00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:01,200
2d image so uh installing it

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,200
on the pi 4 it's quite easy

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,280
you download the image you flash it on a

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,600
microsd

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:13,440
and as it's usual with raspberry pi

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,559
you just you just put the microsd

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,919
in the raspberry pi and boot it

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:22,559
and it's okay a very later version of

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,640
the raspberry pi can also boot from usb

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,559
you would have to make some manual

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,240
modification on the image for doing that

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,440
but it's

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,000
kind of supported as well

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,799
okay our next question we just have

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,679
three minutes

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,000
uh so it will be quick any idea how far

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,559
the integration on post

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,600
market market os is the big screen

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,720
okay so i can take that uh so uh from

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,760
what i know there are

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,960
a few packages on post market awares who

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,200
are trying to package

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,440
big screen and microsoft for post market

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,799
os

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,200
okay great uh

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,280
the other question is is there a python

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,200
wrapper for the ocs

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,200
playing store api

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,919
uh so yes uh i think there is a

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,720
python wrapper but uh we don't use the

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,760
python wrapper

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:24,880
we use the cute stuff directly

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,520
okay great uh so the last question

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,760
uh which applications are supported for

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,480
big screen cute only

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,240
gtk do they need to be optimized for

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,600
remote control

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,159
okay so uh basically

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
the the the thing is on the last

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,720
question do they need to be optimized

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,320
for remote control

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,280
is yes so

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,400
any application that works decently with

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,200
the remote control

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,640
and it's at the moment packaged on neon

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,520
or

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,880
packaged on postmaster post marketplace

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,919
um

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
that is supported but if on one end you

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,880
could

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,440
you could really launch the gym at the

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120


00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,400
on on on there but you wouldn't

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,679
do much with it in the end uh

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,320
so if an application is gtk or if it has

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,159
a

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:23,200
a private um

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,600
private toolkit it's it's okay as long

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,120
as they they work nicely with the remote

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,200
control

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,320
you can you can for instance you can

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,720
just

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,000
install kodi alongside and launch code

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,360
is an application that's

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,880
perfectly supported

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:45,840
but but yeah just just anything goes

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,840
as long as works well with the remote

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,520
