	00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,520
all right traditionally it is my job

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,080
to do the buff wrap up

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,880
and this year i really felt that other

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,480
people should do

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,920
it um i would really like it if

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,520
new voices new faces in the could come

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,199
in and do the buff wrap up because

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,119
it's largely a a matter of

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,400
knowing what's going on in the world

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,640
what's going on in the

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,599
community what has happened during the

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,399
day

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,280
and there's no particular that i should

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,360
do it

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
um so i'm armed with an ugly red guitar

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,879
today

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,440
in case no shows up

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,160
this should be considered a threat to

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,239
you all

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,399
an existential threat of some sort um

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,079
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,840
look up the

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,559
schedule because i forgot to do that

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,879
beforehand

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,879
and

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,479
call on the different boss chat today in

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:16,320
the schedule

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,320
we also had the academ the kdev agm

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,040
which chewed up a lot of time that was

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,080
an excellent way to chew up a lot of

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,320
time

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,119
i quite enjoyed it let's just

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
massively zoom in i would like to call

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
upon

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,280
a representative of the snap off

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:41,600
either igor jonathan one of you

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,680
to talk about the snaps that we had

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,720
i guess that's me i guess igor is not

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,079
here uh

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,759
we had a snap tutorial uh rather than

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,360
above physically it was mostly

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,119
looking at how to build a snap and we

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,240
built k blocks as a successful snap

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,680
and also looked at well why it hasn't

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,600
quite taken over the world yet

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,960
and um that was not yet integrated with

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,439
binary factory

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,599
uh the code is there but it needs some

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,920
arguments with sysadmins or with

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,480
snap developers to work out how best to

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,480
get it running

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,000
all right thanks jonathan but i think

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,000
you're also

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
on the hook for the next bit

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,680
the next boss round

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,519
i can't just do all mine i had four or

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,560
yeah yeah

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,160
do that do all of yours

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,239
well there was also a flat pack one and

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
maybe jan wants to talk about that but

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,160
uh

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,640
he also gave a tutorial about how to

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,000
build a backpack and successfully built

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,160
i think crusader into a flat pack um

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,840
and we looked a bit at some of the

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,200
integration in kde

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,599
and uh and

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,480
uh it's got how it works with fedora

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,200
integrating

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
and um they look set to take over the

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,840
world

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,319
any minute now uh we also

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
we're gonna have one about uh homebrew

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,920
the mac

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,920
package manager but uh pearl jury is in

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,879
hospital so please everyone wish him

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,760
good luck to

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,519
get better instead i had a look at neon

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,720
and how packages get built in neon

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,000
and i built a qml terminal package in

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,519
neon

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,879
and that has already taken over the

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,319
world so that's that's all good um

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:40,159
and i we had one at app image

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,560
and uh we had alexis

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,920
uh tell us how to build an app image so

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,840
maybe he wants to say

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,360
more about that but he gave a tutorial

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,799
on that including some of the newer

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,200
technologies because he's been working

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,440
on

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,599
a bunch of new infrastructure for how to

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,799
build these stuff so he was just

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,879
a sort of making soul and then some

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,200
magic turned it into a yammer file that

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
uh pretty much produced a successful app

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
image without

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,519
having to care too much about writing

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
that um

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,120
and we discussed how to integrate that

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
with

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,040
kde including the uh cadillac

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,959
applications

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,159
and he also had a special guest speaker

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,519
which was pro bono

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,320
simon who did a lot of the initial work

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,320
for app images

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,800
all right thanks john do either jan or

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,880

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,240

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,240

hi uh

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,720
it was so not long ago that i haven't

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,840
really wrapped up my mind around it yet

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,000
but basically

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,680
uh we had a bit of a conversation about

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,160
the some of the ideas i

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,120
suggested on my talk uh called

kd's products uh from saturday and some

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,400
topics that nate wants to also touch

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,199
uh on friday so if you think it was a

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,759
good idea

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,560
well listen to his talk we discussed

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,199
about how to

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:27,039
feed getty products into a

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,039
product price placement and

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,479
promotion promotion yeah thank you very

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,240
much and

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,840
yeah that was it was just half an hour

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,479
very quick we will try to

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,360
follow up in a small virtual sprint or

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,240
something along the lines

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,319
all right so the four ps are things to

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,639
pay attention to

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,599
thanks uh moving on to one of the other

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,840
p's in

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,599
room two it kicks off this morning with

00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,080
a promo buff anika

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:03,759
and paul anika are you out there

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,280
yes i'm here hi hi tell us about your

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,240
buff

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,639
okay so we discussed about the progress

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,759
we

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,639
did in 2019 so we are pretty

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,759
good in our social media but now we have

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
to focus

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,120
along the other lines so we are going to

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,759
get rid of the

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,120
workboard and see which tasks are doable

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,199
and which are not doable

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,639
so that we can actually focus on our

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,800
long-term goals

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,319
there are a lot of initiative discussed

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,720
by the

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,080
group and we have come up with very good

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,319
ideas that we should

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,639
target the niches especially for

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,880
universities schools and colleges

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,160
and we were quite inspired by

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,120
yesterday's talk

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,800
related to dental health so maybe along

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,919
those lines we should start

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,000
coordinating with the influencers and uh

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,680
we should bring on board some

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,560
um experts in the field so that we can

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,879
promote specific applications and

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,840
products

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,000
so it was to us but that was the gist of

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,000
it

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,360
mute mute yes indeed that was thanks for

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,479
the

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
the gist of it um for those that weren't

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,160
at

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,160
the both you managed to last until

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,520
well the whole morning and then after

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,680
that

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,879
after that there was towards a more

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,919
consistent user interface

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,360
in both room two that was run by

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:41,039
nobody because it moved to wednesday

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:45,519
moving on to room three nate graham

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,519
who will be joining us from his bed

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,880
the toolbar entitled title bar

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,800
unification

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,000
and conference room and bed unification

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,120
obviously as well

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,720
nate how was your boss

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,360
uh let me get my camera turned on for

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,680
just a moment here there we go

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,680
uh this this was good buff it was a very

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,640
technical buff

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,920
myself and several vdg members and

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,959
asthma people

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,519
had a consultation on how we go about

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,120
implementing a proposed change to the

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,920
breeze theme that we've been working on

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,480
for several

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
months now it was a very productive buff

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,880
we came up with paths

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,720
forward and got some things unblocked so

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,839
i'm pretty confident that breeze is a

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,000
bit prettier in shine

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,000
here's simply for plasma 521

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,519
all right thanks nate you're welcome and

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,880
now i'm looking at room four which was

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,640
blissfully empty all day so it seems

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,279
like we've reached the end of the buff

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,560
wrap-up

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,480
for wrapping up this day four

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,040
of academy i'd like to thank you all for

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,080
attending and you've been spared my ugly

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,680
red guitar

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,680
