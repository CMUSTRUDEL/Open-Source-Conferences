Title: Akademy 2020 - Adriaan de Groot - Fla Fla Fla Fla Fla ing Alive
Publication date: 2020-11-27
Playlist: Akademy 2020
Description: 
	The FLA -- Fiduciary License Agreement -- is a tool that the KDE community has to manage licensing in the long-term. The "long-term" here means "beyond the participation of a particular person in the KDE community" and it's a useful tool in protecting KDE as a whole with Free Software principles.

Copyright lasts a long time. Rules changes. Legal frameworks change. So copyright -- and by extension, the Free Software licenses that work with copyright to ensure the four Freedomes -- can last too long: so long that circumstances change out from under it. This talk will examine the FLA used by the KDE community and describe how it is used to mitigate change in licenses and copyright, and why you should probably sign one.

[Music]

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,000
hi there and welcome to my academy talk

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,600
the talk with the subtitle eventually

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,199
you'll all be dead

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,000
i'm adrian and i'm going to be talking

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,720
about kde's fiduciary license agreement

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
that means licensing copyright legal

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,760
bits

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,519
copyright is one of those things that

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,320
just happens there's a

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,040
plenty of laws around it but most of the

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,040
time

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,559
whenever you do something creative

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,200
copyright happens

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,480
so if you do something creative two

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,760
kinds of copyright

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,079
are created moral rights which identify

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,200
you

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,360
as the author or the creator of the work

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,800
and economic rights writes the

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
exploitation of the work

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,120
so if i grab my ugly red guitar over

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,160
here and play a little song

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,199
you know like i like to work on

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:06,640
kde it's written in plus plus c

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,479
bam copyright happens i now have the

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,240
moral rights to be identified

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,439
as the author of that terrible little

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,479
song and if we want to exploit it

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,479
that's my right as well

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,799
speaking of copyright the license on

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,520
this talk is creative commons

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,240
attribution sharealike 4.0

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,240
as long as the copyright exists that's

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,720
the license you'll need to abide by

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,960
when you reuse or remix this particular

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,840
talk

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,200
so for the next 70 years or so those

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,240
economic rights

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,200
attached to this talk are dealt with

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,280
that's a long time because copyright

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,200
lasts a long time and it's longer than i

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,000
personally am likely to care about the

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,920
economic rights to this particular talk

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,159
as a matter of fact it's probably longer

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,880
than i myself will last

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,520
that's a long time but during that time

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,280
i can trade in those economic rights the

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,439
economic rights to a talk

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,520
or to any creative work can be bought

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,280
sold traded on the market

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,560
you can assign them through contracts

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,560
you can even give them away

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
when you license something you're not

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,040
giving away the

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,040
economic rights you're granting a

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,440
license you're granting use

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,599
and so open source licensing retains the

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,680
original economic rights

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,599
the author of the creative work the

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,920
author of the source code

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,599
still has those economic rights and of

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,120
course the moral rights as well those

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,120
never go away

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,319
but those economic rights still vest in

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,800
the original

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,800
author

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,959
there's a number of reasons you might

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,560
want to contact

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,400
a rights holder the holder of the

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,040
economic rights to a particular creative

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
work

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,120
for instance if licensing needs to

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
change licensing might need to change

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,040
because it's unclear

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,879
because it's incompatible for instance

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,720
if you've got source code that combines

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,319
two different open source licenses it

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,000
may be incompatible

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,519
and you may want to contact the original

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,800
rights holder to find out what was

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,480
actually intended

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,319
you may want to ask the original rights

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,400
holder to grant a different license so

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,680
that it becomes compatible

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,519
this is also one of the reasons that

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,840
licenses get updated

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,000
when laws change when interpretations

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,920
change when technologies change

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
licenses may need to change with them

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,640
and at that point you need to contact

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,280
the rights holder to ask them for a new

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,280
license

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,879
a new grant to use the copyrighted work

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,400
another reason to talk to original

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,280
rights holders is in case of

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,280
infringement

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
in general it is only the original

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,159
rights holder

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,799
who can deal with infringement

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,200
violations of the license someone is

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,599
making illegal copies

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,560
well it's the original rights holder who

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,680
has standing

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,959
to deal with it basically that means

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,959
has standing to sue

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,840
as long as we're trading in the economic

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,680
rights to a creative work

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,000
there's a number of ways that the rights

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,120
holder can be changed

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,080
generally if you're working for hire

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,040
your creative work is copyrighted by

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,920
your employer

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,759
not by yourself this isn't all that

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,560
common in the open source world

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,840
but in general work for hire situations

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,880
it is

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,400
you can assign or trade the economic

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,600
rights to somebody else through some

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,759
kind of an agreement

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,360
a sales agreement for instance and you

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,120
can also assign

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,199
the economic rights through some other

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,639
legal instrument and i'm going to return

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,080
to the subtitle of this particular talk

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,639
and remind you

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,320
someday all of us will be dead and your

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,840
will is a legal instrument

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:52,639
that transfers economic rights

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,639
to somebody else namely your next of kin

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,360
so there's a number of reasons why you

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,240
might want to change the rights holder

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,000
and whichever reason applies to you you

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,560
can use any one of those

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,919
instruments that i mentioned earlier to

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,600
change the right holder

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,240
you can sell trade or give away

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,039
one of the instruments that exists is

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,360
called a fiduciary license agreement

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,080
the word fiduciary comes from fetus

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,880
latin for

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,280
trustworthy someone you trust to do the

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,560
right

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,759
thing and a fiduciary license agreement

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,840
is generally something

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,080
of the form i trust you to do the right

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,880
thing and you trust me right back

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,400
because your fiduciary is someone you

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,560
trust with your life or at least your

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,400
creative output

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,039
so kdev has a fiduciary license

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,800
agreement

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,639
and you might want to change the rights

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,639
holder in your creative work

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,440
to kdev one reason to do that is because

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,240
kdev has a charter and a social contract

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,080
it's bound

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,000
by its own statutes

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,199
and so it can't change its mind all that

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,400
easily

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,600
you know now that it's going to abide by

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,039
certain principles and it's going to

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
continue to do so

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,880
independently of the individual members

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
of the ev

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,639
and independently of short or long-term

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,160
gain

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,120
the ev exists as

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,600
long as as it as an association exists

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,639
and the united nations is actually the

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,639
successor organization for kdev

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,120
so you can rest assured that as long as

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,080
the united nations exists

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,280
someone can take care of the

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,319
responsibilities

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:41,280
of kdev as a copyright holder

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,680
and so the con the fla the fiduciary

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,080
license agreement that tries to assign

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,520
uh copyright to kdev was written in

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,000
conjunction with the free software

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,080
foundation

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,759
europe and basically it takes all the

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,479
assignable bits

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,000
all the economic rights gives them to

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,680
the kdev

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
and right away gives everything right

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,880
back to you

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,400
here's the url to read the actual

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,919
document

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,039
here's a quote from the document

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,520
which basically says what i just said

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,080
here we'll give you this stuff and we

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,680
give you

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,840
a non-exclusive license right back at

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
you

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,240
the effect of this is that kdev has

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,160
standing to deal with

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,039
all those reasons to contact the rights

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
holder

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,479
the ev has standing to sue has standing

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,360
to re-license

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,639
in re-licensing it's bound by an

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,919
additional document

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:43,039
the fiduciary re-licensing policy

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,319
which says what kind of re-licensing kde

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,800
ev can do but as a consequence also

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,960
because

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
you got everything back you can

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,759
re-license and distribute your source

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,039
code

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,400
your which is your source code

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,800
as usual

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
so all in all if you're a contributor

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
kde

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,080
any part of kde under the entire

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,080
umbrella and you trust the kdev

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,039
and you've read the document and find it

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,400
to be in order you could sign the fla

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,520
the fla is entirely optional

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,520
it's entirely optional to sign the fla

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,720
but if you do you make kdev

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,560
stronger and it can take

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,120
some responsibilities off of your

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,319
shoulders the responsibilities for those

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,919
economic rights

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,719
and place them on somebody else's

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:41,839
this has been my talk remember someday

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,839
all of us will be dead

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,479
