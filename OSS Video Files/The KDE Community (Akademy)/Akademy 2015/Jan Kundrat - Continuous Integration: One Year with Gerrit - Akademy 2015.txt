	00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:14,030
so what I'm trying to deliver with the

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,820
stalker without trying to achieve this

00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:20,010
sure my you wire into my current and why

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,310
I believe it it's up it's a good thing

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,380
for KD as a wall so let me start by

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,850
saying what i mean by continuous

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,320
integration because they're you know

00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,330
there's been a lot of talks about

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,570
continuous integration continuous

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,879
delivery other stuff so the thing which

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,670
i'd like to focus on is a work phone

00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:41,370
where you know whenever someone

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,350
submissive match which might be a great

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,899
new feature might also introduced the

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,879
regressions I'd like to have a some

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,070
automatic setup which would be the first

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,199
language against triggered in which

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,239
verifies whether abilities to green and

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,269
whether all the tests which you used to

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,100
succeed so succeed and so this is the

00:00:57,269 --> 00:01:00,780
idea but continuous integration which I

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,430
feel they like to get in which we cut

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,650
with guard this is also something which

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,930
might be a slightly different from the

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,110
currents that which most of dat projects

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,729
are still using which sort of rebels of

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,710
the review board so how how many of you

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,250
actually like working with this pretty

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,039
bored it's 0 for the audience who might

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:30,149
be watching the video and how many of

00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:32,880
you have to try to get it also money

00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:37,070
about at least three of them and did you

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,070
like it or did you not like it each one

00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,400
that's right so did you like it more

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,479
than did you like it more than really

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,890
important excellent Samia at least a cup

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,170
of carrot lovers which is like something

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,210
it's the fingers was ringing birds there

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,220
there is really a lot of small things we

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,159
should be for example having to business

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,680
review something keywords I mean it's

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,420
really small thing but it's exactly the

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,369
kind of thing which I think that a

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,159
computer should be doing owned by on my

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,049
behalf I'm doing all of this in my free

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,360
time and I do not really wanted to you

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,510
know keep pasting some random numbers

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,910
around and yeah I've really got bitten

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,530
by a buyer by my review book quite a few

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,230
times and I just do not want to use it

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,910
anymore so compared to the reader

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,920
prepare it is something which is what

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,170
ever it well integrated with gave you

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,140
both which is by just doing a special

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,540
form of it push you can you can retrieve

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,330
any version of any page very simple

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,250
simple git git fetch it's good so it's

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:38,130
well it's a little different or it's

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,620
simple and it's also something which is

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,470
up which we aren't really unique in

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,790
using and the keys project is using it

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,250
eclipse the seasoning and plunger for

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,890
the projects are using it and what I'd

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,769
like to do is to make you know just to

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,320
show how how I tend to work with Jared

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,350
so what I'm going to do is to create a

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:04,859
simple batch with into dry down don't

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:06,630
worry I got it ready now I hope you can

00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:08,970
see it I try to use reasonable screen

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,870
resolution so it's essential just

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:17,370
something 30 40 sorry for getting a

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,260
couple of icons to a to random dialogue

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,650
as you can see if because right now if

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,530
you you try to send a new email you see

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,880
these two two buttons at the bottom and

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:30,560
journal I cons and icons are cool of

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,560
course so I'd like to add some icons

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:44,319
I do not want to do that of course so

00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:46,510
what I do is you know I've just modified

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,180
some files I took some shortcut to do it

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,910
now I don't act in a commit message and

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,150
because I edit a couple of icons the

00:03:51,910 --> 00:04:03,760
message is going to be eating some icons

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:09,670
to the composure composure oh and hi

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:14,620
from alive Garrett demo please really

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:16,539
this carefully that's it and now I'm

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:22,870
going to invoke a magic comment which is

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:24,430
for cycling I'm not really going to

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,650
explain all the details but the thing is

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:32,139
i'm just using let's what you get when

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,680
you reboot all them so now what I've

00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:38,650
done right now is the time uploaded

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,110
uploaded a new new bachelor it and I can

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,169
show you oh I don't have fire fox

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,260
hunting cap so it's going to take a

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,260
while

00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:57,160
anyway if firefox was a little faster I

00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,580
could have shown you how to how to how

00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:04,120
it looks like on the web interface so

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,280
maybe I can give it some time until

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,289
locked up there and it loads but the

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,789
thing is what is really important what

00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:12,910
has happened right now as i alluded

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:15,099
dispatch some servers they can park

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,840
which are patiently waiting for whatever

00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:18,940
jobs might come to them they have

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,919
already started you know trying to

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,360
analyze this page whether it's the

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,520
world's weather all the streets to

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,570
process but we were surprised if there

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,669
is a problem because you know this is

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,009
just a change which it's a bunch of

00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:32,680
icons but are still you know but things

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:34,960
can happen I've only tested this using

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,889
85 maybe there is some food for specific

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,960
thing which which I forget I want and so

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,460
what's happening right now is that I

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,050
think at least five bills are being

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:49,720
performed in in peril now it's using a

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,000
bunch of different versions including

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,530
five does tube of cute cute photos

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,659
frequent 540 using GCC and clankers comp

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,820
hours there is also a Windows course

00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:09,880
course belt going all using mean gb 64

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:12,159
and yeah there's one thing this is you

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,870
know quite a limited projector with the

00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:17,050
limited spooning resolution and the

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,669
great website we loves to to use all of

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,770
your screen estate so this is not going

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,719
to be very impressive I can maybe

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,909
increase the font size a little bit and

00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:28,479
hope for the best I don't know it's

00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:31,090
treatable at least a bit so what you can

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:36,360
see if what I have just done is was

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:38,590
opening a come on go full screen please

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,960
anyway so there is this is something

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:44,320
like an overview of how the great web

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,690
interface looks like and in this area

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,340
you can see that some feedback from the

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,340
continuous integration that it's being

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,520
tested right now I can open a live

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,620
status page which shows me that there

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,110
are some jobs which are still running

00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,750
these are the blue ones one of them has

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:04,550
already succeeded the green one and this

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:08,090
one is good stuck in a queue because you

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:10,330
we don't really have so many sever

00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,980
something right now for some reason and

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:16,850
it's going to be executed after a while

00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:22,370
anyway and so while we wait for the for

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:25,580
the for these results from from from the

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:28,310
continuous integration I'd like to

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:32,060
explain what exactly is this see I set

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:34,100
up going doing because it's something

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,050
which is called zool which is sort of

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,300
funny name it comes from the open state

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,100
guys who are quite famous for assigning

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,360
funny names such as zoo or Tupac

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:46,850
absurdity projects and the purpose of

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,010
zoom in this context is quite similar to

00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,080
what the Jenkins would normally do i'm

00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,260
using zoo because what what it was

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,270
little easier to do it this way and in

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,690
the system which is different now in

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,280
park zoo actually performs two things

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:04,310
first of them is just barely fee making

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,470
pitches which i try to describe and the

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,750
second one is something which you may be

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:11,300
already know from the ladies continuous

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,970
integration it's some you know producing

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,680
some more mass predators for showing the

00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,480
status of each and every project where

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,210
it still builds whether whether some of

00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,660
the test suite test test cases are

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:26,210
failing on this is roughly how it looks

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,700
like on your left you can see our list

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,380
of projects each column represents a

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,020
certain bills bro file for example using

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,820
heat fighters do a vital for using

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,750
different compilers if it's green and

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,480
well it's green if there is some some

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,490
red thing it's a it's a sign of some of

00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,030
some trouble either it doesn't build or

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:54,430
some tests failed it's a it's a written

00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:54,430
in there now the fingers

00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:02,670
sorry I thing is all of these tools are

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,800
effectively completely separate because

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,260
you know a great is one still going to

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,540
zoo is the second standalone to internal

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,120
us they were we were able to make them

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,310
play well with each other and another

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,690
example such a tool is actually bugzilla

00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:22,480
and what I'd like to show for the hard

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,660
if you can right now is how the

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,330
integration of opens line of it looks

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:32,140
like I'm afraid it's a little bit blurry

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:36,190
but didn't see it on the atom it's a

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:39,190
small chance of exam page and what

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:43,240
appeared is simply getting a bunch of

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:45,400
custom fields which which showed it to a

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,220
particular bug report there are two

00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:52,210
pitches in period which which sort of

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,250
address this issue and in a similar

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:57,550
manner which you say the button is howdy

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,290
it looks like in current and shows live

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,600
data from maxilla which are always

00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:04,150
synchronized in there is really no

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,940
potential for them to do get out of sync

00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,860
and it shows that the result you know in

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,900
this particular page it tries to address

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:16,930
the certain butter sudden bug reporting

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:19,300
and yeah if it was you know well focused

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,370
it will children it's a son bucking

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,410
plasma shell in such-and-such complain

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,770
and it's already fixed because while new

00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,990
jeans is already has been already merged

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,330
so at the point is this is about

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:35,110
integrating two separate systems which

00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,820
were designed with little do you

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,370
know-know knowledge about each other and

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,900
still they are able to play well because

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:47,590
they there is a set of standardized

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:51,550
api's now and whatever I talk to someone

00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:53,350
able to get it sooner or later someone

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,330
would set it great sax and well that's

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,190
right because it sucks a little bit

00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,270
especially user interface sucks quite a

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,250
lot and you really

00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,810
they have to read the documentation in

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,550
order to know to do you know have to

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:09,560
fight its entire thing but there are

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,250
actually two bonds which I'd like to add

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,950
first of them is that there it is more

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,230
than just the web interface it's also a

00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,600
set of AP is instead of functionality

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,980
and I think that even if the user

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,930
interface dissed you know the

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,520
traditional website if it was completely

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,770
unusable still there will be some

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,930
benefit of Samaritan trying to use the

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,980
rest and maybe fix the parts which are

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,780
ugly and there's quite a lot of

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,940
development environments which which

00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,100
integrate well with direct for example

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,290
eclipse which you might be a little bit

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,470
you know makes a difference but don't

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,690
really see a reason why someone just you

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,520
know someone could quite easily provide

00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,230
a plug-in for example cute greater and

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,910
in fact it rays are already contained

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,450
some cooked for for playing well with

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:58,220
carrot it's a very basic in the feature

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,070
set that you know we can improve this

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,910
for example we could also write a plugin

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:06,680
forgettable by think and yeah there's

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,680
also a common line to which I'd like to

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:14,500
use and it show you as a another live

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:17,180
demo it's called clarity which is

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,790
another funny OpenStack name anything is

00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,400
it's a quite useful application it's a

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,440
based on ncurses it's written in in

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,540
Python and it supports working offline

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,490
with character which means them it was

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,770
actually designed by by some opens the

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,020
guys who who you don't like to journal a

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,300
lot and burn a lot of her point of view

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,480
on whatever and what they do is that

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,579
because they proved a lot and if no

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,529
no network access in the airplane

00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:44,290
somebody wanted to get something which

00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:46,510
you would provide a feature set

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,540
comparable to the regular m-f land so

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,579
what I ended up doing is they don't make

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,120
something which talks to Garrett using

00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,800
the standard api's and what you can see

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,649
right now is a list of some previous

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,110
which are which were some KD projects

00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:05,170
which are which are were editing to

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,660
disclaimed and for example right now I'm

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:11,769
going to browse a list of pending

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,959
pending batches to treat down the set

00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:15,880
which or a list which we can see right

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,100
now it's something which i haven't

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,990
reviewed yet you can trigger between

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,790
showing everything and I can go back to

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:28,810
show in just something which which meets

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:31,120
review and young here is my badge about

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:35,519
tearing some icons you can see that it's

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,660
quite one integrated it shows the the

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,579
list of results from the continuous

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,940
integration we can already see that our

00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:47,620
belt was successful if I competitive to

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:50,940
the website it should be yeah maybe it's

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,769
reload right you can see that it

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,170
receives an automated won't from from

00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,810
the continuous integration system send

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,519
it it's perfect so with maybe some of

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:07,360
you are bored you can just review my

00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:10,990
pension say ya go but yeah back to the

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,639
dirty um I can of course not only you

00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,470
know just browse some some set of

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,250
reviews or whatever I can also take a

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,839
look at the unified death and of course

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:23,290
because i'm using quite a big form so

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,720
that it's visible the the quality is not

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,840
really it's really perfect but i think

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,280
you get the idea if you

00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,180
if you use it on your laptop it's going

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:38,630
to be much better now going back to the

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:40,310
tall now going back to top here I also

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:44,120
have to admit a great absolutely has

00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:46,430
some Sun formats and in fact something

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,830
which are presented as up benefits of

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,500
ger it could be also one of its you know

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:54,350
strongest defenses because the afraid

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,450
it's integrated with great sorry with it

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,760
means that someone really should learn

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,380
how to use kids because if you are

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,780
missing some good basics like how to

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,940
make a bunch of comments and where the

00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,550
branch means how to push and whatever

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:12,020
you are going to fight with direct so in

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:14,390
this ink tercer extent yeah great might

00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:19,250
not be terribly useful for people who

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:22,280
really struggle with it oh yeah I think

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,500
that the biggest it your technical the

00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,380
people challenge is that it you know

00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,080
using very efficiently require some even

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,790
a client-side who which are which is

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,980
something which simply automates the

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,230
think about adding a unique identifier

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,200
to a commit message because that's what

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,640
you need if you ever want to upload an

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,490
updated version of your badge because

00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,650
you know otherwise you have no idea how

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,640
do you who to have to understand whether

00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:53,710
you are you're updating something craft

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:56,600
yeah these are this might be a little

00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:59,210
inconveniences but still it's possible

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,210
to get to run them with what some to

00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:05,300
link for example there is a project out

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,310
there which offers via a web interface

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,160
where where people can just you know

00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:12,590
upload upload a unified if and it's

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,230
going to to link is going to create a

00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,850
great review request and I do not

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:21,470
release any reason why we can't deploy

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,240
this with KD if it makes you know life a

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,770
little bit easier for some of our users

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,690
and potential contributors well why not

00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:33,950
so if you're interested in some

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:35,600
technicalities technically it's brian

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,899
it's an open simple string right because

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,389
there was some

00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:42,360
300 and thanks for thanks this is not

00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:43,680
for that it's using its using to put

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,050
hipster which is another friend sister

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,730
from the open state community to execute

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,839
the jobs something like that you know

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:55,019
just a simple form of our pc stuff and

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:57,929
the key feature is we really just used

00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:59,550
all of the Gainey's existing automated

00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:02,790
set for performing the village so the

00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:06,990
blood scripts are identical and even the

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:09,029
metadata are just simply reused and free

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,309
up up one thing which I really really

00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:14,069
like compared to you to you to Jenkins

00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:17,549
set up via Franco and PD is that this

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:19,829
finger provides a more build profiles or

00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:22,649
more built versions because as I said

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:26,339
you can build against multiple versions

00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:28,289
of 85 first in perfect ever the fact

00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,940
that Jenkins can do it as well but i

00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:32,580
think is our instance right now doesn't

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,279
afraid Witcher which are you know it's a

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,970
little bit unfortunate for me and I'm

00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,039
slightly off topic think because we are

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:44,010
already performing a full rebuild

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,440
whenever someone's in the badge we were

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,210
actually able to provide windows dixit

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,190
falls as an installer whenever someone

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,380
you know uploads a change for testing

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,630
which means that for example if I have a

00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,000
Windows user and he reports some some

00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,190
nasty and and back and I can fix the

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,870
pack for him I can just put point him to

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,909
my continues narration set up and he's

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,730
able to reinstall and get to fix them

00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:09,480
and I can get to fix tested which is the

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,520
perfect thing yeah it's sort of shame

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,159
that we can't really do something like

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:19,409
that in an easy and efficient manner on

00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:21,390
the one on Linux yeah the CI metrics

00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:25,049
which i showed you know that Pratt and

00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:28,380
written green table it's technically

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:31,200
it's built on country couchdb it's also

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,570
one of the all in pieces of code which

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,190
was written specifically for KDE because

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,170
the OpenStack guys do

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,570
have a slightly different workflow so

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,120
they haven't really needed this specific

00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:44,250
these sorts of diff parts this is very

00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,220
useful for KDE because in KD we

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:51,060
unfortunately do not have mandatory code

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:54,540
review we hello all of our developers to

00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,790
just go and push stuff and yeah so this

00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:03,260
is why I think we need something like

00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:05,760
this yeah and technical side ow

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,040
everything is implemented in just

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,140
refusing jquery which was sort of a fire

00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,120
chief for me to do whether it's also

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,770
something which i really don't like to

00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,490
do ever again because well it's

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:19,140
javascript and yeah similar the

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,270
integration between great and bugs aha I

00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,000
mean what javascript is fine but it's

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,850
not really my cup of tea yeah the

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,800
written boxes are also this is also

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,660
something which is which is done

00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,720
completely on the client side on the con

00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,520
side and it's rigged part even some

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,010
server side weeks because you know that

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,420
is full of security exploits and issues

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,410
and whatever and there is the funny

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:45,060
things such as cross-origin resource

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,830
scripting how is it called in access

00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,290
control a lot origin header which I

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,450
really had to strip away the first

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,670
feature to work because you know Garrett

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,890
in 3d bugzilla rounds at different level

00:19:53,670 --> 00:20:04,260
domains which rather all sorts of fun

00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:06,750
and so as a quick summary and yeah what

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,360
I'd like to say yes but I think that we

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:12,830
already spent ready to do d pointer it

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,350
and to make quite a good use of it I

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:18,120
think a little to no changes have been

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:21,120
actually made in the past six months so

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,520
well yeah except the new status metrics

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,470
which is quite a new action but I find

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,380
that the system has been already proved

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:31,440
and shown to be to be you know

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,750
reasonably stable and usable and I think

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,280
that that is point and this is also the

00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:39,630
purpose of this talk we should really

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,890
try to try to evil eye it whether it's a

00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,110
good choice for us whether it's

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,299
something which each of us would like to

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,150
using their own own project so this is

00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:50,240
my suggestion if you'd like to give it a

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:56,700
try I think it would be terrific and

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:58,440
yeah yeah I think this is this is all

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,960
about the technical technical stuff and

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,299
i also have one wants one thing which is

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,910
more of a personal there was a quite an

00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:08,309
extensive this went along this nation on

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,340
the KD CordeValle management and i'd

00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:13,290
like that motion is for not being

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,870
receptive enough i'd like to improve in

00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:20,820
asparagus that I don't think that yeah

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:23,130
anybody enjoyed the discussion so thanks

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,600
for your attention if you'd like to keep

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:27,390
to use greater try great for your

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:38,940
project with terrific and if you've got

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:42,480
any questions I'll be happy to first

00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,700
I've ever stood there and get it forces

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,940
you to use a special a game-breaking

00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,549
work phone is this room this character I

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,400
didn't katic forces you to be super like

00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:55,710
there are people were close to the brain

00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,830
she can give and collaboration and it

00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:01,559
forces you Gary vs. blue one of them I

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,780
don't really think so you know they

00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:06,990
might there might be sir workflows which

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:09,900
are a little harder to to get with

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:13,110
carrot in with reasonable efficiency for

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:16,440
example if you've got for example if

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:18,480
you've got a long-lived branches and

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,730
you'd like to review merges between

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,830
these small cliff branches it might be a

00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,720
little complicated a little more

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,460
complicated than the rest I'm quite sure

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,860
it's doable because there are projects

00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:33,030
out there or at least I think so what

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:35,490
exactly is but yeah I think I can only

00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:37,640
comment about my own experience and my

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,020
own experience is more or less volatile

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,480
about a single branch which is always

00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,940
reasonable stable and what almost always

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,230
ready for release and then there is a

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:52,040
you know set of feature branches

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,840
the key thing with great is that what

00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,940
you would usually implement using using

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,890
a feature branch in credit scores it'll

00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,600
begin it's simply a series of off

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,730
comments which depend on each other and

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,860
while they've got a scent assigned to

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,780
certain label which by the way happens

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,299
to be exactly the same thing as a great

00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:11,929
yes you know branching it except for

00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:13,760
namespace wet lips it was my second

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:17,809
question whether it's possible to review

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,690
group of countries at once I if you mean

00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:25,580
power to squash them all into a single

00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:28,190
column for example is ready for to them

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:31,730
till I put everything it'll signal that

00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:34,220
you can enlighten Tiger review for tech

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:38,240
domains which are of each other but you

00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,850
still wants to let cancer praise it well

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:45,200
what Garrett's felt very diverse on a

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:47,480
per page basis so if there is a feature

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,370
which which takes you 10 but is to

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,100
implement you will have been changes due

00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:54,590
to evaluate of course you could take a

00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:58,400
shortcut and you know just take a look

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,750
at use whatever kids to its get use

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,570
which you'd like to use or just you know

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,429
just console get diff whatever and take

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,650
a look at the diff between the start of

00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:08,900
the series and the end of the series and

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:12,650
if you like it well yeah then there is

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:15,080
that not really so useful way of just

00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,669
applying pressing the mouse 10 times

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,700
because you could do a brief 10 matches

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:22,040
but actually I think this is quite a

00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,520
good thing because if sort of forces you

00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:28,100
to think about it get by sections

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,679
because if you ever want to you know

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,270
find out if there is any regression you

00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:36,020
really like you really wanted to make

00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:38,720
sure that you know there is for example

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,860
no final forgettin filing commit a which

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,290
only could fixed in a subsequent

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,850
subsequent comment which won't if you

00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,289
know what I'm talking about this might

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:50,870
be a little bit annoying so yeah

00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:53,120
like you know Lisa collapse tile floor

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:56,600
request when there's like 11 comments of

00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:00,559
you it is played full dated then you can

00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:03,440
comment on like the whole big is fun in

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:07,100
Garrard yep there is there's some

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,159
ongoing work on on actually being able

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:13,159
to do submit an inter topic as one thing

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:17,139
that its ongoing work and I don't think

00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,139
it will happen any student to be honest

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:42,049
that's a good question now my turn this

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:45,919
is what for me I can't really see much

00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:47,809
of a fitting my thingy myself using

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,090
isn't complicated because I already

00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:52,760
found which is good enough for me on

00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:55,130
your right and i think that's Katie

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,350
communities in a point wagon and arson

00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,049
and we had voted is it better secretive

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:03,470
of them female bodies after all and when

00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:06,409
we have different different venues and

00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,480
different needs to advance and for

00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:10,519
example 8 minutes and it's great anime

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,880
because of the fluid informative if it

00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:15,799
makes up morphol little easier for

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,630
foreign commerce and little harder to

00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:19,760
forgive my dinners maybe there's some

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:23,779
progress compared to like to focus on

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,299
these sorts of uses I know them in my

00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:28,130
name is fermented and up there is quite

00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:31,220
a lot of your students were contributing

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:34,549
fishes magana so I think make sensors

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,529
are push the load can be going to be

00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:39,919
harder to enter a little little higher

00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:44,480
so firstly because if Indian blood

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,970
relatives one of 18 it's a little harder

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,940
than just something which is why but

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:52,250
yeah so I think in the answer is yes I

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:56,600
think that these you use can coexist in

00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:57,600
two places because we are all doing our

00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,850
freedom

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,150
well I think it's each furniture design

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,470
birthday aw jeez maybe there is some

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,380
this case for civil war continues

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:11,809
focused I don't know if I can imagine it

00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,809
would be a little confusing times

00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,130
