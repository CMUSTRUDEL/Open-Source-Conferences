Description: 
	A presentation about what's been done and what's left to do on GCompris new look.

This year I started working on new graphic design and illustrations for GCompris thanks to the partly-successful fundraiser for this project.
I want to give an overview of what's been done, explaining some of the choices that were made.
Also I will point at the remaining tasks for any interested contributor to help complete the look transition.

	00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,740
I hope everyone in this room knows what

00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,650
the country is that is an awesome

00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:20,029
education software or to the collection

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:35,120
of applicator activities that is now

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:38,720
part of KDE okay you may also have heard

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,370
but crowdfunding campaign we did between

00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:46,610
the end of last year and beginning of

00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:50,870
this year to Allah which worked on a big

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:55,250
graphics update sadly as you can see the

00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:57,830
we didn't finish the ball but we found

00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,830
some ways to start the work and adapt

00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:05,810
the plan to at least to make it look

00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:09,260
better the real goal was to unify all

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,390
the graphics assets because we had we

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,630
all kinds of different styles and

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:20,210
different quality of illustrations and

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:24,250
so we didn't look really professional so

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,250
I can show you a quick video

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:49,030
very saturated colors and looking very

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:53,259
black up lines everywhere soon and see

00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:56,049
with the graduates evening flat colors

00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:59,049
Oh everything mix so I didn't cook it

00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:06,869
very good by taking on the bells click

00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:10,869
on a letter you click on a letter ok so

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:14,530
the I started creating some guidelines

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:20,530
to define a star that should fit that

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:23,680
could fit the project and I put those on

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,799
internet and requested feedback from the

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:36,090
community and a few people gave great

00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:36,090
feedback and made it look like and here

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:48,319
okay so yeah guideline the few points

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:52,459
explain by text with a few mock-ups at

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:57,890
the end to illustrate the this time we

00:02:52,459 --> 00:03:03,620
intended so after the guidelines were

00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:06,110
ready and I started with making new

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:10,010
graphics from scratch for all the venue

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:24,530
in the yes the front page let's say of

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:27,260
the application and that was like yes so

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,790
these are for example animals were

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,420
planting each each categories of

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:38,239
activities that are now look consistent

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:44,660
and hit with the guidelines then the

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:47,810
icons the menu icons and the vertical

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,140
bonus which is the restoration shown

00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:59,780
when you finish a complete or fail an

00:03:51,140 --> 00:04:05,859
activity mmm mmm the world are also a

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:10,310
few qml tricks to add like Hades or to

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:18,200
tweak the position of the assets so they

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:24,080
looked more more in place sometimes can

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:26,470
show you then of the example of the

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,470
result

00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:38,889
you can see now for example we have some

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,919
pages at the bottom here that tell the

00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:45,729
people that they can scroll because

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,919
without the daily there was no visual

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:55,389
feedback during the war more activities

00:04:47,919 --> 00:05:00,810
to scroll also all the the application

00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:05,050
activities icons or loop well together

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:08,229
let Sally as I said I couldn't complete

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:12,699
the wall refactoring graphic refactoring

00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:16,900
so I could start to redo from scratch

00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:19,960
with two activities but then to be more

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,750
efficient I had to reuse a lot of the

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,330
existing assets and clean the end don't

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:28,360
you stay like yeah mostly cleaning the

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,539
shapes fixing them sometimes changing

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,139
the colors replacing the super loud

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:46,810
lines with shape outlines that provide a

00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:50,319
variable wife and we go further so you

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:54,129
can keep all the colors now all much

00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,500
less saturated and also it helps because

00:05:54,129 --> 00:06:00,659
for an education education very

00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:04,719
saturated pictures were very distracting

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:07,689
and didn't have to see the important

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:13,810
things of the activity so it now it's

00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:16,419
now much better yeah in this sense but

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,219
it's still not perfect so there are

00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,819
still a lot of work we'll probably do

00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:24,279
another apart from the very soon to get

00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:25,839
more time to work on this but if some

00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,470
people are interested to get some help

00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:32,390
well you're very welcome and if you

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:35,180
to have fun drinks and cute graphics

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,980
just get in touch on the comp ratio

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:41,930
directly to me and we'll be very happy

00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,930
to get you help

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,530
