Title: Frederik Gladhorn - Qt Quick Controls Reloaded - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	An update about Qt Quick Controls and the recent research by The Qt Company how to improve their performance.
After taking a step back and profiling the existing controls and some experiments on the mobile platforms, we decided to implement a new set of controls targeting especially embedded platforms. This talk will tell the story of the new set of controls.

Qt Quick Controls have become and important part of the Qt Quick and QML world. They work nicely and are used widely, also in Plasma Next.
The Qt Company had to research performance improvements for users on low-end hardware. While this doesn't directly impact KDE, many performance improvements can be applied to the desktop as well.
This talk will touch on the complexity of the controls we have, loaders, input handling and the interface between QML/Quick/JavaScript and C++.
It will highlight the performance difference between different ways of implementing the controls in various ways.

and he's gone all right I have my doubts

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:41,149
about the liking part butts okay yeah

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,339
it's great to have you all here I'm

00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:47,510
super happy to be at the academy in

00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:54,769
Spain I actually started my KDE journey

00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:58,280
and Spain a short while ago but yeah so

00:00:54,769 --> 00:01:01,249
my name is Bella clapping you may have

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,970
known that before I do work at the cute

00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:11,540
company a great place to be it lots of

00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:13,790
fun and we happen to spend a lot of our

00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:17,390
time at this ninety percent of our time

00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:20,869
on cute open-source the stuff that you

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:23,890
are all we are all using and we all

00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:29,210
appreciate and love and sometimes hate

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:34,640
well that's how it goes and so yeah I

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:35,930
thought while the cupid controls the new

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,049
iteration and we are currently working

00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,060
on our targeting embedded a lot I still

00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:44,600
think there's a lot of relevance for

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,030
Katie and I kind of wanted to talk a bit

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,490
about it so that people know what's

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:53,869
going on what we are thinking why we're

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:57,020
doing this and maybe also discuss a bit

00:01:53,869 --> 00:02:00,439
with you if there are things that Katie

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:04,460
wants to benefit from and how we can

00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:09,410
make certain things work nicer so yeah

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:13,880
let's get started 2005 I

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:17,090
madrid's and while looking at vocabulary

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:21,320
applications there was really only this

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:24,380
one somewhat great application that was

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,980
k bak train which I ended up maintaining

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:31,040
a while later so that's how I started to

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,630
become active in ke because it had a

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,130
combobox that at some point couldn't

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:39,140
show me all my lessons anymore for my

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:43,550
Spanish needs so Spain is guilty I did

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:46,520
join nokia been a bit later in 2010 had

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:49,400
a fun ride there many of you all of you

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,430
probably know the story I'm going to go

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,130
into too much history here nowadays we

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,770
are the cute company maybe not everybody

00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:01,010
is hundred percent sure what that is so

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:05,960
we are one hundred percent owned by DG

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:09,530
a-- which gives us a bit more freedom we

00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:12,020
don't completely just portfolio because

00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,670
they are incidents and they do things in

00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,300
finland and we are much more

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:21,620
international and we focus on cute no

00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:23,840
surprise there I have and I still do

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,790
care a lot about accessibility I have

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,910
been driving that and cute a lot I

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:37,910
really wish somebody would want to pick

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:40,820
it up because I + 1 X it's almost ready

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:43,760
to be used to go mainstream to attract a

00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,520
new user group it's it's so close I

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,850
could almost use plasmonics blind so

00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,940
well but enough about that lately I have

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:55,070
spent a lot of time on QA things because

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,820
getting Petra's into cute is not always

00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:02,300
a smooth right and I'm also working with

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,880
my team on driving you quick forward and

00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,470
one

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,470
the things we currently focus on a lot

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:12,900
is yeah keep the controls and how we

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,990
think maybe they could be better than

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:20,459
what we currently have in the set that

00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:23,610
we all love or hate that plasma is

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,340
embracing and I think the controls we

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,350
have right now are really important and

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,570
they provide many things that people

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,620
want for example they nicely adapt to

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:37,770
the native loops but we do have a lot of

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,160
embedded while customers using embedded

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:43,140
or low and hardware and for these

00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,440
sometimes really have to use those

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:50,100
controls because they do eat a bit of

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,970
memory and using his style I was

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:58,620
discussing with a few of you so martini

00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:02,180
laughed and just said yeah you're insane

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:05,790
trying to use cue style in that API so

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,680
and other people are less enthusiastic

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,080
about new developments because they say

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,660
hey give me working controls that means

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,850
they need to look native so we'll just

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:19,770
be bored and say that's maybe something

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:22,080
we want to question a bit yeah I think

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,060
in the original abstract I had written

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,790
something about performance I don't want

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,280
to tell you how to optimize your quick

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,230
applications here today so if that was

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,170
your expectation feel free to move on

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,240
I'm really sorry but I think there are

00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,580
many people here that know that part

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,000
better than I do actually you've worked

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,400
with a lot I want to give a bit of an

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,370
overview what we have what are cupid

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,430
controls they are out there currently as

00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:57,630
if you'd lapse project I assume we will

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:59,220
get them into cute five to six as a tech

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,990
review so people can play around with

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,120
them and before we make them final and

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,070
this is also something where I think

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,680
it's great if we can get feedback from

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:11,430
you guys what is missing styling the API

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,570
and new know who's being back there he's

00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:18,750
he's set to destroy me and pound me to

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,669
the ground and yes make my life hell for

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,630
doing the wrong thing so we'll see how

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:28,830
that looks I want to show a bit of a

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:33,570
demo and we we will see what we end up

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:35,700
with so oh yeah and we have this insane

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,430
high resolution screen with 800 x 600

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,520
pixels which I didn't quite expect so my

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:45,240
texts care of it cut off I'm sorry

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:49,140
anyway the big thing is with the current

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,780
set of controls we actually instantiate

00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,729
a lot of objects and allocations are not

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,250
always the fastest thing and not the

00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:58,360
more clever most thing you do and so if

00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,120
you instantiate one button and you

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,310
up with I'm not hundred percent sure but

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,150
about 16 key objects in various

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:10,800
constellations that takes time so my

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:13,509
dear colleague JP he really sat down and

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,750
actually started by looking at android

00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:19,539
and was wondering okay android five how

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,180
do we implement this diet and he

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,889
basically concluded whoa this is a lot

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,650
of work we will be playing catch-up

00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,330
forever and we would probably fail

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:34,960
because android sex is around by the

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:37,569
time we get done and so looking at this

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,370
he actually started his spare time

00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:42,460
you're hacking a bit and looking at

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,199
things and did this tiny side project

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,129
which is out there for people to play

00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,229
with which is i'm not sure what we call

00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:53,500
it huge android controllers or something

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:56,439
like that and that actually allows you

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,199
to use native controls which works

00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:00,939
surprisingly well with cumin they were

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,150
experiments before with widgets and

00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:10,150
kumar so this is actually an interesting

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:11,830
trend and he saw that the performance is

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,259
actually in many cases better than what

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:18,099
we were offering with kid quick and

00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:20,849
that's really got him started and so he

00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:22,499
started to look at benchmarking and

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:28,110
trying to see what we could potentially

00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:30,959
do yeah and you can see he ended up for

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,800
button also the time to instantiate it

00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:39,180
having 5.7 30 seconds instead of 151

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:43,709
does make white a big effect on you for

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:49,430
users if we now think Katie wants to go

00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:52,230
to phones and reconquer the word there

00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:56,069
we probably do want some of that

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:58,410
performance so I do think that it's

00:08:56,069 --> 00:09:00,660
relevant for Katie also even if we say

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,000
we usually have big desktop machines and

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,880
they have good performance but still

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,110
it's always nice to save a bit of memory

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:12,660
and time it just makes everything better

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:17,699
so I don't want to yeah hang around on

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:23,190
that point too much mess another point

00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:25,350
that this question like and I need to

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,680
provoke no no a bit more is it a good

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:31,829
idea to have everything in queue mad

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,170
right cumin is fun and it's easy to

00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:38,220
write it is good to prototype but

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,680
sometimes there might be limits the kid

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,630
quick one controls they kid quick

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,810
controls one or cubic controls as

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:50,149
commonly known with it basically in the

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:54,990
only qml with javascript mixed in and

00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:56,730
actually even from our own people

00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,920
working in Berlin trying to do proper

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,500
tooling we got quite some criticism

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,899
because it's really hard to do good

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,990
tooling when you have some

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:08,029
thing that that's a tiny programming

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,689
language that JavaScript happens to be

00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:14,300
so in order to let them support the

00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:17,209
controls in queue creator they would

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,199
have to jump through some hoops and some

00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:22,399
more and try to pass JavaScript and

00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:24,499
actually at some point the project just

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,199
becomes insanely big when all you wanted

00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:29,569
is to be able to drag a button from

00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:34,129
somewhere on to a piece of canvas right

00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:35,540
so when we first discussed this with

00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:38,119
them they were actually really happy

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:43,040
that we were considering having a more

00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:46,519
strict separation of logic and doing the

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:51,139
actual business logic and C++ and then

00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:55,879
using qml for what's visual because that

00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:58,550
does make sense and yes what initially

00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,279
was the intention of humor so we took a

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,920
big step back of trying to get the

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,990
separation straight and like the typical

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,449
examples like the same game that's a lot

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,249
of JavaScript code and in the end it's

00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:12,379
not really the kind of application we

00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:16,160
want to write we want to write good

00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:19,699
applications that are fast and use human

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,829
to express the UI so this was a big

00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:24,110
motivation for us to do this experiment

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:27,079
which turned out to be actually working

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,089
quite nicely and it is still in the

00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:32,279
works so this now is a great time to

00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,319
influence that the whole styling and

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,980
theming their discussion is going back

00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:40,050
and forth should we expose q palette and

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,350
let you have an application palette that

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:47,819
gets inherited or not there are many

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:50,579
open questions so I'm really also asking

00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:55,709
for input but I wanted to show that what

00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:57,899
the current state is so I just put a few

00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:01,160
random controls on the slide here and

00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:04,829
it's well they are not that exciting

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,920
yeah you can of course click a checkbox

00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:09,990
and this is just the default style so I

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,910
think that's the big fear that you will

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:17,220
be stuck with this look because well JP

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,439
just decided to have this flat look it's

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,449
relatively easy to implement for us and

00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:24,300
that's what we started with it looks

00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:28,160
okay in the modern times but new know

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:32,699
sometimes wants more flexibility okay

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:38,459
but yeah this is kind of easily done and

00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:42,899
I can just move on so another big point

00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:45,240
is oh my godness will quit controls go

00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:48,569
away because this is the replacement and

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,279
I'm very convinced that they will be

00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:51,839
around for a long time because they're

00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,779
convenient they are what many people

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:58,800
want to use but for some use cases they

00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:01,170
don't just don't work well enough and so

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,480
that's why we really want to offer an

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:06,149
alternative so how do you make the

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,040
decision we use version one or two how

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,990
should

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,670
is going to is it going to be a potting

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,980
effort like move everything from one

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,260
thing to the other and the answers maybe

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,970
you don't really have to choose because

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,690
you can just use them at the same time

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:25,120
so yeah I just have a button from the

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,530
good ole controls here I think that's

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,350
the fusion style because i have my own

00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:33,760
pew built and the new controls and they

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:35,260
just happily coexist so there's no deal

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,970
in mixing and matching them the only

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,660
thing you need to do is you need to

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:42,940
import one of them with this s trick so

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,800
you get it in the name space because we

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,250
do want to call the new button also

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:58,360
button we don't want to do weird name

00:13:48,250 --> 00:14:01,300
spacing there so yeah our poor designers

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,290
you know suffering and crying what is he

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:08,110
going to do so when doing this we took a

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:11,860
step back and actually writing the

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,330
business logic of botanists maybe not

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,370
the hardest thing in the world are doing

00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,580
Kokomo sending and so on on it it

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:22,210
accumulates and when you start

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:24,070
implementing a slider oh my we still had

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:28,210
bucks on our slide after two years I

00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:31,660
believe so some things are really hard

00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,329
to do in human actually you get binding

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:38,600
loops

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:41,929
and yeah it's just it's possible and you

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,730
can keep on reinventing stuff that works

00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:45,049
well enough for certain application but

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:51,619
we want to provide something that just

00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:53,839
works so I was thinking to see to show

00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:56,420
you about how we think this could be

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,489
solved I would just write a bit of a

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,649
custom look and you know is going to

00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:02,959
hate me more because actually it's going

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:06,230
to look horrible because i'm doing the

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,899
designer doing styling but maybe we can

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,759
later get together and he can try to

00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:14,720
implement the way he wants things to

00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:18,499
look so let's just see how does it work

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:22,819
wait this was not what I wanted so how'd

00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:29,199
I get out of there yes so I gave myself

00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:32,929
a lot of chaos here it seems um yes no

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:37,730
why oh ok I wanted to start with a blank

00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:40,189
canvas to not see my own show and then I

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,790
thought okay that will do the basic

00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:47,019
thing so if I want to have a button

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:52,879
surprise i'm going to write button and

00:15:47,019 --> 00:16:00,429
give it some texts i can't type

00:15:52,879 --> 00:16:00,429
obviously so then that's

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:09,680
just put it up there and take some what

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,470
works this is the great glorious green

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,840
button that we've seen before and so the

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:18,860
question is now how do I have any

00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:21,710
influence on the visuals right so what

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,210
we came up with is that it's very quite

00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,330
performant if you just have visual items

00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:29,330
a normal item not a component but a

00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,040
plain old item will be just accentuated

00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,010
when it gets passed and the whole thing

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,730
is not a huge problem so I can for

00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:40,040
example set a background property

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:43,490
background and that should be because

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:52,220
i'm lazy just a rectangle and then let's

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:55,490
give it some yeah color what's a

00:16:52,220 --> 00:17:00,170
beautiful color some random stuff here

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:03,410
picked out earlier horrible horrible who

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:06,430
knew no you have to suffer this and

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:09,020
there I have actually changed the

00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:11,300
background part of the button and I can

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,270
of course to the usual fun things of

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:18,110
doing radius and giving it some

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:21,319
roundness and then I can also replace

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:23,290
the text part which is just the default

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:30,280
convenience thing instead I can say

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:33,280
label shall be text elements and oops

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,280
what

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:47,860
so yeah almost good so it is actually

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,519
possible with this approach of having a

00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:55,090
sort of delegates to do a very custom

00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:57,309
style that looks different and of course

00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,070
now we for now lost the behavior

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,419
completely so when I click this button

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,629
nothing seems to happen because

00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:08,080
obviously I didn't tell it how to change

00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:11,799
the visuals so let's just check if it

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:18,700
does anything at all on click for

00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:20,679
example I could do rotation very silly

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,859
example but it demonstrates hey my

00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:28,029
buttons actually working and it just

00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:31,539
behaves the way it's supposed to so if i

00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:34,749
wanted to implement a bit more fancy

00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:42,039
things like prostate i need to give it

00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:48,340
an ID and then i can do if the button is

00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:54,730
pressed i give it one color and as I

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:58,830
give it something else no no what you

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,830
want what's your favorite hex value

00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:02,369
likessee booth

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,799
let's see if that oh my god that's so

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,320
great here I don't know what happened to

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,970
item it's probably very beautiful and on

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,540
this projector let's see better so

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:24,880
perfect so this is our current thinking

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:31,960
on styling and of course it could I just

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:34,990
need to find one wait then we of course

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:41,140
don't need a color and we do not have a

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:48,130
radius property and then we do source 10

00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:54,250
meters does it see I don't write

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:57,790
commercial and everyday life so what did

00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:01,350
I have their I didn't quite know did I

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,350
have well

00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:26,760
so let's see I oh I'm isn't now so

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:30,610
generally it would work with our trouble

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:33,970
yeah that's figured out why it doesn't

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:36,820
work now so this is yeah pretty

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,950
straightforward how you can start has

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,480
some things and now for the slider

00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,409
implementation for example this is

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,419
cumbersome right and they are I think

00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,289
it's actually really it might even be

00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:52,779
very attractive to you because you can

00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:55,510
do pretty easy things so if i put my

00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:58,179
slider there then well that's no big

00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,830
deal and then i want to have the handle

00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:02,409
look different for example then I just

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,360
do handle and here i can put rectangular

00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:07,000
because that's all I know how to do do

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:12,669
you do the proper design and then I have

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,909
height and width it's going to be the

00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:18,159
biggest handle ever if I do 30 and then

00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:20,169
I need to cheat because I somehow they

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,179
managed to learn by heart but this is

00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:23,860
actually part of the documentation that

00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,860
we have at the moment that it takes you

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,270
ok if you want to make the handle it p

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,130
in the right position this is how you

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:34,510
can do it unless you want to do special

00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:41,220
magic oh yeah and then I could also give

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:45,850
that rectangular color lights to move I

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:50,130
got the message so my extremely

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,130
beautiful spider isn't working no

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,090
okay why is it not working probably a

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:02,990
mess up something I have a backup slider

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:04,940
here should we use it back up that's

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,130
before I make a clone of myself

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,650
completely like coding sometimes it's

00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:12,580
just horrible so somehow this magic

00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:18,200
slide idea does work more I don't know

00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:26,780
what did I change the color the color

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:29,210
heartbeat yeah I don't have the ID ok

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,740
let's revive the first I guess the slide

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,820
and replace and beautiful second one

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:40,550
with that thank you it's always good to

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:48,110
have an attentive audience ok let's see

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:53,690
it ah ok so I asked me to work on my

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:55,520
slider but I don't think doing a slider

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,520
from scratch and human has ever been

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,570
that fast so part of what we imagine

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,570
this to be awesome

00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:09,220
it's a turban I don't know it's it's

00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:12,820
done that kind of way out how you can

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,190
build your components and that enables

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,110
you to easily do some of those things

00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:21,600
that have traditionally been harder than

00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:24,460
human so we can even look at the

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:30,039
implementation of this screen resolution

00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:33,879
is just I don't see anything so this is

00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:35,559
also the completely wrong thing so what

00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:44,440
we do internally is actually we just

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:49,330
have this I love it okay can can you see

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:52,539
anything i watch over him so basically

00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:55,210
what we have is two things we have a

00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:58,389
slide out of humid fire which actually

00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:01,960
is used to instantiate the normal slider

00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:04,600
you see and then on the inside we have

00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,639
abstract slider here and we have the

00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,690
same for all the controls sliders just

00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:13,450
the one I like to pick on today and that

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,220
one the abstract slider is actually the

00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,749
thing that's written in C++ and we

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:21,119
nicely hide that from the user so you

00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:23,649
never have to see it and then we just

00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,870
yeah do all the right things hopefully

00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:26,820
and

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:29,220
if you don't like them you can nicely

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,440
replace them so for example the handle

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:36,000
here this is what we have been fiddling

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:40,500
around with so this is a way of doing a

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:49,040
pretty lightweight pretty flexible style

00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:52,740
of a tmobile control set so yeah that is

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,190
our thinking at the moment and I said

00:24:52,740 --> 00:25:00,000
there are huge question marks so I'm

00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:03,690
very curious about your opinion of is

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,590
the sensible would Katie want some of

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:11,160
this how can we use it and of course

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:14,010
it's it's java Simon that there is no

00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,929
good way to make this work nicely with

00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:20,190
the old approach of using Hugh style

00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:23,610
because that is just turning out to be

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:25,410
so hard that we don't really even want

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,230
to try supporting it in here we want to

00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:30,240
do is clean start but if i look at

00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,910
plasma you already have custom themes so

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,190
there feels like this might be actually

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:37,290
a nice fit i I don't quite know I

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:45,390
haven't thought about it too much so

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:48,809
yeah do you want to my eye yeah must of

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:53,330
the mic research haha i got them

00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:53,330
sleeping is not cool a plus forever

00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:48,510
oh yeah that's one of the things we have

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,880
been wondering and so what we imagine

00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,820
right now if you are actually building a

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,010
platform then you would not take our

00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:01,650
default components but should beautiful

00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:05,330
things in there so I don't think it

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:09,090
scares indeed to replace every single

00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:11,790
controls implementation one by one

00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,730
that's not what we want so either you

00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:19,739
create your own subclasses kind of your

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:51,729
own something files that you can then

00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:56,739
something like that okay we should try

00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:59,049
it maybe the API has been kept as much

00:27:56,739 --> 00:28:01,059
compatible as possible but there were

00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:04,869
some radical simplification so for

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:07,210
example when looking at the scroll area

00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:10,389
we found it's a hugely complex beast and

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:12,549
it might be easier to just have normal

00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:16,389
flickable and have a very easy way to

00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:18,070
touch attach destroy bus so I think

00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:23,080
they're the API has actually changed

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:26,590
also for the tab pass I think it's a bit

00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:32,259
different so some things have definitely

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:36,009
changed the basic API asset is as

00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:38,320
compatible as possible but the more

00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:41,440
complex widgets also the stack widget a

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,830
slightly changed so yeah we can look

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,830
into it

00:28:55,649 --> 00:29:03,610
yeah yeah so that's really one of the

00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,769
troubling things that we now have

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:09,519
actually quite a few different one who

00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:12,279
has their onset and we have now our

00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:16,059
second one because we hope this is the

00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:20,760
next step in evolution but yeah we're

00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:23,559
all trying to stay close to the API but

00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,380
when it's conceptually a different way

00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:29,460
of composing the controls then the old

00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:36,970
API often doesn't make sense anymore

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:42,039
yeah so oh yeah that was my last slide

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:49,450
also how are we timewise oh we have time

00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:51,669
for one question so and also the

00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,889
shameless plug by the way if you can

00:29:51,669 --> 00:30:02,370
imagine working in austell and fun

00:29:53,889 --> 00:30:02,370
things or in Berlin you could just get

00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,500
the combo box the middle

00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,550
we don't have many of the more platform

00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,400
specific controls at the moment because

00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:26,280
right now we want to provide a set that

00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:30,210
fits the more yeah simply your eyes so

00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:32,700
you can use the controls once began such

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,130
at the moment and in the control to set

00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,620
I said it's not finished it's far from

00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,540
release 5 foot 6 is where we aim to have

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:49,010
attack with you there's just nothing

00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:49,010
there at the moment yes so thank you

00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,410
