Title: Riccardo Iaconelli - WikiFM: How Do You Bring Open Knowledge to the World Top Labs? - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	WikiFM wants to change the way we create knowledge, how we study and how we approach top level education. How do you create a vibrant community which brings together the world best laboratories with the culture of freedom typical of an open project? How can you allow students to share and contribute their work while ensuring the thoroughness and quality required by a scientifcal textbook? This is the story of a few students, researchers and professors that are trying (with some success) to make the world a better place, while contributing to the diversity of the KDE community.

Some years ago, a group of students from the University of Milano-Bicocca found themselves full of scientifical material, created during the years of hard study, that had much didactical value, but with very limited possibility to be spread to future generations. They invested blood and tears into those manuscripts, and they didnâ€™t want to be in the same positions of previous students, whose amazing work was available and circulating for just a couple of years after the creation.
Fortunately some of them had some experience with Free Software projects, and a solution was found: a wiki! Ideas and concepts were flowing, the project growed fast, and the wiki started to be useful to many other people outside the initial group, which brought everybody to realize what a powerful tool it could become, if used correctly. The ideas were so powerful that it awakened the attention of the HEP Software Foundation, a scientifical group which contains some of the best minds of the top world institutions, such as CERN, Princeton, Stanford and INFN. And exactly related to this, we have a very big announcement which we kept secret just for Akademy.

Understanding that KDE is not particularly aware of the WikiFM effort (also because of the very different nature of the project), we would like to present the project to the wider community, with our vision for the future and our short term goals, including the most pressing of them all - internationalization. We see this moment as a big opportuinty for creating more links between the two communities, to strengthen the KDE roots, get the discussion flowing, and finally give a big push forward to open didactics.

	00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:15,559
we have recovered the key contributor

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:19,640
developer sins more than 10 years ago he

00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:22,010
started at age 40 pin so that he is a

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,089
cosmic or developer and he's also

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,710
collaborations with Sam and other

00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:33,009
research institutions and how we will

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,009
present his next project wiki nfm I

00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:45,079
would like to change the way higher

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:47,420
education is this is deliver and stowed

00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,359
students not only to students are

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:54,890
actually but also to researcher

00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:56,239
professor continuous learner and to

00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,269
explain you this I want to tell you a

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,600
story today I'm sorry about how a group

00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:05,089
of students from physics and mathematics

00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,240
in a university in an Italian university

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:14,110
I try to make an impact and change how

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,110
the word does it's things to open up

00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:26,659
this is a picture from 1967 of MIT in a

00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:31,210
classroom this is the same bathroom in

00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:35,689
2015 can anybody tell me what changed

00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:38,000
now cuse personnel well you see here

00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,310
that better fess oh here is that your

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,219
hand here just words number that's gonna

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,990
stain you can see how that could be a

00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:48,229
problem we have some space for

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:51,259
innovating here I would like to ask you

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:55,430
something meantime if you are our FB

00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:58,130
university students here but the great

00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,969
majority of sick that second place to

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:05,450
party how many of you have always been

00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:07,729
in the University knew all the time what

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,950
you had to do for an exome had all the

00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:13,280
lecture notes without getting one music

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:18,120
ladies anybody

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,189
exactly I always feel that I was

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,530
absolutely terrible like I usually spend

00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:24,239
most the biggest part of my study for my

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,280
exam in actually collecting all the

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,530
material that I needed all the lecture

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,049
notes I had good friends for her

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,359
fortunately so could exchange notes and

00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,430
we could confront each other on what we

00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:39,000
had to do but it was very very

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,099
suboptimal we have a few forms of

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,980
communication such as for example we had

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:46,319
a facebook group but you know what

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,889
problems there are in a Facebook group

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,250
first off its Facebook so it's not open

00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,419
source it not everybody has facebook

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,980
most of the mean of community there the

00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,840
way you can communicate on Facebook is

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,200
limited I didn't have thread you have

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,489
any ways or permanent content what would

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,280
have you done what it would have any

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:08,730
free software developed I'm say well I

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,299
can show my own software I can start a

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,489
wiki it was a privately but it was a

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,579
great success you can my fellow students

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:20,609
because we can we could write it down

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,470
everything just there were about 50 60

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:24,569
people so I just needed once you

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,579
remember everything and we could collect

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,099
a good knowledge we also use it for

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,720
things like writing down the most common

00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,229
questions of the professor's since it

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:39,299
will the private with me anyways and

00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:43,319
start to be moderated using now for work

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:45,689
of six months anything changes and we

00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,090
started having the first ideas or that

00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,609
I'm presenting now here today for our

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,909
course a person advanced calculus which

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:57,030
was extremely well made but someone made

00:03:53,909 --> 00:04:00,840
that the professor was teaching us how

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,790
to do calculus was giving us exercises

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,790
that not even the assistant was able to

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,209
figure out how to solve so we were in

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,760
trouble we we're going to have an exam

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,019
of

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,579
for five months and then no way to we

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:20,620
didn't know at all how to solve the

00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:22,690
exercises to pass the exams we were we

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,400
we were students who wanted to make an

00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,220
expert and so we decided to learn our

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,550
self how to make these exercises and to

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,100
rise a man well our own book on how to

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,630
solve this everybody was concentrating

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,090
on one little part was starting on our

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,260
best books and I'm figuring that out and

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,030
I'm writing it for for everybody to know

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,430
at the beginning to collaborate I

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,100
propose well why don't let for abused

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,410
kids quiet so far but then for

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,960
additional positions who birdie use

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,270
linux at that time it was not really the

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,199
best solution so second option well

00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:02,289
let's try to store it on the week and

00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,600
there is no web page imagine here there

00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,490
is a web page and I honestly don't know

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,580
it worked five years ago in America

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:16,900
anyway we can see to that it's close

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:19,419
enough ah this work very well the

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,400
material was extremely high fully only

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,860
your usage just use it you're after me

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,130
has used it and everybody has passed the

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,440
exam and let me figure out if you extend

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,970
this to our forces which we liked or

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,530
which were particularly difficult such

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,880
as quantum mechanics to this quantum

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:40,449
mechanic for example and at that point

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:44,020
we we end up with a lot with you figure

00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:46,570
done Leila with 15 about 15 books on

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,139
different subjects more than 2,000 pages

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:52,680
of saying typical attempt and we create

00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:59,430
the most important things it was a team

00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:01,560
extremely high quality which is got it

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,660
is high quality exactly because we use

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,780
it for study and we pass the exam so we

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,380
know it works it works for a university

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,050
course not only this but we started to

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,539
see that it was not only the people from

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:19,229
my university who were using the content

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:22,530
it was also people from all around Italy

00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:24,539
the greatest episode about this was when

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,419
I went to Erasmus in Sweden for six

00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,520
months and I remember meeting an italian

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,860
serie the physics well it shouldn't

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,840
projects to me and say oh look there's

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,789
this amazing website check thousand

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:42,419
plenty of things you will use it for

00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:45,060
everything so thank you so we have they

00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:47,550
idea they're here we get them which is

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:52,080
what I want to explain to you today the

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:56,099
idea to have to collect in one single

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,400
place all the material all the lecture

00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:01,860
notes actually even up to the complexion

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,820
of the textbooks this is the range we

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:09,630
want attacks in a free and open way and

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:12,330
collaborative way and what we want to do

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:15,270
is you want to answer the question can

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:18,060
we actually kill it that looks Oh be

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,159
nice will you imagine no textbook you

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,669
remember that at the beginning that lets

00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:24,599
wait really instead of that food we have

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,370
we have documents created

00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,320
collaboratively we have textbooks which

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,539
are alive when something new gets

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,340
discovered it can be integrated when

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,259
another university it has another

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,030
approach to a certain topic which can be

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,889
found interested I mean all of these can

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,479
be discovered textbooks can be assembled

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:41,099
I cannot tell you okay study this

00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,509
subject when visits of textbook cameras

00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:46,740
are around this one I can assemble

00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:51,449
everything why we could have stumbled

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:53,789
everything we are raising

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:55,819
everything up quickly FM is based on a

00:07:53,789 --> 00:08:01,520
few technologies which are really really

00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:04,169
nothing not me like lady or a week and

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:11,129
another ingredient which profiles in run

00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:12,900
for more than desire to students but we

00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:16,889
can have really brings into the mix

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:20,339
which has not been done before is the

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:22,909
connection between these three things we

00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:25,289
have some open source projects such as

00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:29,039
which burski I've checked the Italian

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:32,430
version it's it's really it is not

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,320
really let's say not really completed as

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:38,909
like / physics course has three pages of

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,680
content we got plenty of Cephas last man

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,919
was but nothing else except computer

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,649
science if we use the power of the

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,240
students were doing the work of taking

00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:50,660
the nose anyways and we just tell them

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,910
ok let's try to write them on the con on

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,529
online we go to the professor who write

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,600
some lecture notes and just published a

00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:00,389
modern PDF on a website but would have

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,690
no problem to write them on a website we

00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:06,630
tell them put them together who they met

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:12,510
on your unique source this unfortunately

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:14,880
is much more than we as were University

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,709
students who really do this in the free

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,899
time or in their study sign but it's a

00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:22,260
very limited amount of time could ever

00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:26,730
think of tackling this is really a

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,649
global challenge it's a challenge that

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,690
goes beyond the Italian University it's

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:37,110
really it can be embraced by everybody

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:40,110
and it is why we decided to ask the KD

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:43,019
community and incubation we wanted to

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:46,170
have the shoulders in order to support

00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:52,230
the weight of doing this global

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:55,380
challenge and KD thankfully say yes you

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,779
respect my faster you're a KD project

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,279
and we also got paid by with media eaten

00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:02,899
which is the sister

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:10,220
organization of wikimedia foundation

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:13,249
behind wikipedia at this point you could

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:15,970
ask okay I mean this is nice very very

00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:18,680
nice you know I'm just a developer who

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,740
cares I've been a university student

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,839
have no longer university student and my

00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:29,290
answer to this is whoever told you that

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:31,790
we just for the university for example

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:35,180
we implemented this for the university

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,540
actually for some research centers but

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:41,629
really there is no wiki page that ok I

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,069
really had this week demos but i don't

00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:45,050
know why i don't know if it's the

00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:48,290
internet or something that don't show up

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,999
I think I will well this one is that's

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,850
important the next one I will go to

00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:55,069
another cabin show you may be here with

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,839
some coats of sleep an hour of code and

00:10:55,069 --> 00:11:00,559
it can be run inside a browser itself

00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,230
you just have a C++ code and a better

00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,709
run you click run the code gets compiled

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:09,170
executed and galakras in the browser and

00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:11,209
you say okay still this is nice it's

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:15,680
closer to what I do but it's not what i

00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:18,680
do what i do is this it's it's katie

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,959
session i tell katie programs and

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,569
applications i would like people to use

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,559
this easier don't you notice something

00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:34,809
strange in this indiscretion such as

00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:38,389
this bar you know why empty page fit i

00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:40,420
told you there is a demo because this is

00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:43,610
our last future our last this edition

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,769
this is live version of week FM and I'm

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,769
plugged in every logged in user can see

00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:51,679
this and you would just you want to

00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:55,879
develop Katie good you press Katie

00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:58,040
development image and this is it on

00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:02,360
another server remotely I just got

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:05,209
booted up a private hi private distance

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,970
of Carrie I just love you this is mikey

00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:12,350
realistic look it also has compositing

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:14,320
and cure and an an opengl and this is

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:23,890
entirely in my browser

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:27,570
I can play games so imagine here having

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:32,350
your application your source code and

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:35,170
having the possibility to have users

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,850
just a new potential developers just go

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,010
on the website i want to devil 3d how do

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,380
we do it i won't try our thread Weber

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,790
why could it be nice just won't start

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,320
the examples they don't need to download

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,760
anything they don't need to spend hours

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,010
to compile the development environment

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,100
or install all the development libraries

00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:55,600
I think it's done what is this running

00:12:51,100 --> 00:13:01,350
this is running in Milano in and hosting

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:04,660
is sponsored by a gas boom resources you

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,520
of course is very resourceful but this

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,580
is an actual quotes from a private

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,130
conversation with one of the managers of

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:14,470
of this institution the sauce resources

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,510
no problem we'll just do like Google if

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:23,470
you have more users will just throw more

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:25,480
hardware it it so this is also nice this

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,590
is the main features of wicket em and I

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,990
hope I introduce them to you in am in a

00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,660
way that at least give you some interest

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,220
in the project now I want to tell you

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,560
about a few things a few other things

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,440
that happen around we get them in the

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:46,990
last month the first thing that happened

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:49,510
was the earlier this year a new

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,270
foundation a new entity and your

00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:55,000
situation what is solid to be created in

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,280
the physics were an institution here is

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,230
missing the law sorry that with no

00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,769
internet and sometimes the teachers if

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:09,269
there is a in a hand logo I'm noticing

00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:11,339
life today or not it doesn't work key

00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:14,699
people in these institutions got

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:19,110
together to try to fix a problem in the

00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:20,220
physics word which is we are the

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,839
students that come out from the

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:29,939
universities are not ready to to work in

00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:32,040
the big experiments then try to fix this

00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:34,049
solution by organizing summer school

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,139
excellent summer school directly as a

00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:39,179
place but this was the figure out this

00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:41,129
was not really the solution because you

00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,689
could come you can make a student come

00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:44,549
over and stay there for two weeks that

00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:46,920
it would just be a very limited amount

00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:49,610
of students and in two weeks the

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,499
training you can perform is limited

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:55,049
let's say why don't we try an online

00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:56,879
approach where we have vectors our

00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:59,910
lecture from our training which is for

00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,610
sure at the top level but at everybody

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,769
can consume around the world every stage

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,869
that students can consume and they were

00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:10,740
looking for for okay buddy we can be

00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:13,379
hosted in a place which is zero usable

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,959
but still have some excellent training

00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:18,240
what a pledge solution was obvious wait

00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:21,389
if I'm let's started to contribute look

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,730
there's no this works good this is the

00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:25,920
webpage light web page have a foundation

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,319
or they are populating everything they

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,569
just started they started not even a

00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:32,790
month ago so they don't have everything

00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:37,049
yet but are starting to populate all

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:38,699
there or the training material which

00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:41,490
could prove to be a very valuable

00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:43,529
addition because if you have people from

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:47,089
the institution prior in battle training

00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:49,290
on this Katie passion for everybody it

00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:54,990
increased ability it's a win-win for

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:57,299
everybody and what about the rest of the

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,709
world is this greater physics ring but

00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:02,279
this has got high energy physics

00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:04,230
probably got astrophysics also but what

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,350
about rest of the world well this is

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:10,380
an initial plan or what we have right

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:13,080
now in September you already have

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,720
organized three signers three official

00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,190
signers one is going to get sir we're

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,260
going to officially present it to the

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,060
scientific community one is going to be

00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:25,020
at Fermilab they've given it absurd

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,610
America I hope this this recording

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,990
doesn't go to them because if I if I

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:32,430
pull them the equivalent of store

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:35,580
anything just for this Barry for this

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:38,420
one and another one in Chile with the

00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,110
presence of the major Chilean

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,990
universities and the Chilean government

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,060
who seemed very interested in in vfm

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,950
this is for september's it's quite a big

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,180
busy schedule October we are going to

00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,130
speak with these other universities

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,870
we're going to start in Medina bacup can

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,900
experimentation where the professor's

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,030
will go to the students and we'll we'll

00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,680
ask them please take lecture notes

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,450
directly there will try to

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,430
institutionalize this so that more and

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,510
more people are writing on this and we

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,400
are in contact we decided for

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:08,400
universities which might or might not

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,970
start experimentation something we're

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,370
doing right now the speaking and but all

00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,140
these counters are like coming in every

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,000
every moment because every professor we

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,890
speak to every institution they really

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,290
really happy it seems like that's what

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:25,310
they were looking for since years and

00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:28,910
we're just now providing it to them

00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:31,200
November you know you have contacts I

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,450
was talking with some times a day he

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,610
told me he would be very new board

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,190
member it would be very happy to have

00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,480
the same thing in since University

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,760
accolade yesterday was asking him the

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,620
same question of mathematics so at a

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,820
university why not I've been talking to

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,740
the people the organizers of this

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,600
university PL there were so tell me what

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,480
it will be interesting to have vision in

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,840
our university too so we don't know but

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,530
at least I hope that by December we

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,650
achieve world domination every effort

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:08,070
for training in this meantime we're

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,350
gonna have some development team but

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,740
more important

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,630
it is spreading the word as I try to

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,059
make it clear to you make attempt is

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,640
less about going it's also about calling

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:22,100
because we support physical features to

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,470
allow people to ride chapters of books

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,049
and remix Danny give everybody a freedom

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,940
to day that different part intermix them

00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:30,620
but spreading the word going to

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,140
university going to professors going to

00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,539
the people who are already doing the

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,910
work and just telling them don't let

00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:41,500
your work be rotten somewhere on a

00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:43,909
server or unknown make it public sharing

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,710
collaborate with other people put it on

00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:52,100
a single platform where it can continue

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:56,659
to be useful Simon get up on the watch

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:59,299
24 was made by less than 10 students

00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:02,570
hard as in any open source project to

00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:05,750
say the exact number who had been

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:08,870
working in about 12 percent of their

00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,909
studies I just putting things online

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,429
instead of writing on paper or on their

00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:17,179
own computer maybe so just figuring out

00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:20,240
a little bit how to use mediawiki it has

00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:23,750
been examined only and what it has led

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,580
to so I religion premises what has led

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:29,530
to it is 2,000 pages of high quality

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:32,720
material more than 200 users per day

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:34,760
unique users per day the interest of

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,780
laboratories that discern their meal of

00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,539
cellular sanchita other content it's

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:48,130
huge so my real question maria question

00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:48,130
for you is will help ke can we do more

00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,059
thank you very much

00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:12,320
yes I home or other I will ask was the

00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:16,970
relation between we get back and we lose

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:21,950
because it's oral I related pinky back

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,720
by different people actually our real

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:27,920
competitor is not wikibooks it's

00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,110
University the solution to this question

00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,059
lies in the slide were there is the

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:36,860
triangle and the written connection and

00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:40,820
rinse wikiversity has a wiki has not

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,650
related with some form of plated but it

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,650
doesn't have students it doesn't have

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,690
universities what figured out is that

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,790
unfortunately the academic award is very

00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,500
very close in itself it doesn't really

00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,420
know much about what is going on in the

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,750
rest of the world and pleskot every

00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,880
before something you show it to them an

00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,740
example of this is the Italian

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,380
wikiversity which I checked out because

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,690
it's kind of our direct competitor even

00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,640
if we got baked by wikimedia interview

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,220
which should be on the other side so

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,530
it's not really competing and it's

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,240
really tragic the situation there we

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,130
have no content nobody I mean things

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,350
about going there and putting their

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:26,270
material so if it born in the academia

00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:29,179
you have way more contact and way to to

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:31,730
have people contribute to this the

00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:34,910
second way to answer this is technical

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:37,550
it's a minor detail but unfortunately

00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:40,700
wikiversity as since it's a wikimedia

00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:42,260
foundation project is as very very

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,980
strict requirements on a software that

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,210
you're running it and sometimes this

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,150
software this additional software is

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:54,710
very useful for for training such as for

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:57,730
example I don't mean like I will show

00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,730
you Oh blah

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:08,810
documents such as this one here requires

00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:12,040
numbered equations requires references

00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:15,230
require this is a aligned environment

00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,400
mediawiki the media with you that the

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,560
sooner we give me the foundation doesn't

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,030
want to support this by design another

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,070
quest to another question which was made

00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,780
to me was if you support you an out yes

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,220
we can support the amount we can add

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,200
extensions we can all these kind of

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,550
features that are essential for training

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,730
they're not essentially if you want to

00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,320
below an encyclopedia of course but when

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,290
you will feel the book a book like a

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,690
textbook you really need these features

00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:41,540
so these are the two sides that

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:53,980
differentiate us get answer your

00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:59,120
question okay no more efficient so the

00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:01,280
teachers for greatness was publishing we

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,920
never action elves to the to the world

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,730
because if i remember correctly from my

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:14,090
days in jerz head yeah some of the

00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:16,040
program's a little bit it depends you

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,550
have of course we every time we publish

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:22,160
them we were careful to go to the

00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,680
professor and ask the word professor

00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,970
were saying yeah sure go public

00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,260
everything no problem we'll also give

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,970
you the things i wrote you can do

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,190
whatever you want with them some others

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,380
would say what which were a little bit

00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,900
more worried that they would say you can

00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,430
publish them but don't say was me so

00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:42,050
official because of course they had no

00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:44,450
control over that others have told us do

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,490
it and then you can put my name or you

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,980
can say i also checked them when you

00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:53,150
finish your give me the PDF i correct it

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:56,630
and we'll do a real work so it needs

00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:58,520
things nobody ever stopped the students

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,260
to write their own extra notes

00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,740
of course because also they I know

00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:05,090
really sure they are allowed so but so

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:10,520
of course you have different reactions

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:12,740
the work one of the real strengths of

00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,670
wiki FM is that you don't really need

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:19,700
every professor to how to do that we won

00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:21,530
professor for every course maximum and I

00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:25,630
think take all the University all the

00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:29,210
Syrian population we really can do that

00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:36,110
another question which license to use

00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:40,100
for the is a PL and creative commons by

00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:42,860
sheer luck I'm not enough for me I don't

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,800
remember if it's a dl or GPL anyways

00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:55,850
exactly the same lattices as we began so

00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:58,850
that is attribution-share like okay I

00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:02,150
would like to remind everybody we're

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:05,720
going to have a ball one day that

00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:07,940
already is I booked two hours we should

00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,920
be enough to cover any kind of topic we

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,560
can develop new languages we can speak

00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,780
of the technology we have many many kind

00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,750
of junior jobs you know kind of areas if

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,250
you're interested or as I was saying in

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,340
as lighting or please spread the word

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:25,940
because i feel that katie is not really

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:31,550
aware of what we're doing and why we're

00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:34,490
doing it and so please do that second

00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:37,640
request you told me at the beginning you

00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:39,620
were or have you are for help being

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:46,940
university students you can't lie now

00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:48,710
you raise your hands if you can go to

00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,770
your university going into your universe

00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:54,680
take one course take just your favorite

00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:57,560
course it's enough go on the weekend fan

00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,600
page add a few references to the

00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:03,410
material you really found more useful

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,060
when studying just this this is enough

00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,880
contribution to the kickstarter project

00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,430
if you want to

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,220
tribute at a second level go to

00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:14,620
university and speak to them briefly

00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,300
about what I just showed you I can

00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,310
assure you I spoke with hundreds of

00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,680
professors until now the reaction will

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:26,490
be enthusiastic and it would be a great

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,490
contribution to we get them mkd this
