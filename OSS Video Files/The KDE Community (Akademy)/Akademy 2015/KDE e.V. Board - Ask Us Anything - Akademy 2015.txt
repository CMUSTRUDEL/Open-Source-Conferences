00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,090
leash I'm the guy from the last

00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:41,980
presentation I'm the vice president of

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:44,530
the KETV hello I'm over time the guy

00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:50,530
from a few presentations ago and I'm

00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:54,550
board member hi I'm Sandra I'm emerge a

00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:57,640
board member for the last 48 hours I

00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:00,100
think so you shouldn't ask me anything I

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:12,570
would probably let the guys answer okay

00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:12,570
you actually

00:01:51,799 --> 00:02:00,990
careful with what you say yeah yeah so

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:08,640
that's enough very warmly welcomed at

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:11,400
all we had some dinner some food yeah I

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,010
am I still get to use it should choose

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,670
the things so I don't have many

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:23,640
experience to share with you by by far

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:27,140
so far but I'm very happy to have the

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,660
chance to work with these guys I've been

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:33,870
having some conversations for some time

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:37,709
for doing some some things for KD in

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:42,350
Brazilian image America so I I guess

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,350
that's going to do run very smoothly

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:53,000
so it's being very nice and taking

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,010
Sandra out for dinner we already kind of

00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,140
drowned him in documents to read and the

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:19,489
clowns to get and so on oh yeah he is

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:30,230
through the worst I guess for the ATM it

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:34,310
was 150 as active active members the

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:36,500
active hours at some the active active

00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:46,370
members actually decreased from last

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:49,340
year not by a lot I'm not sure we have

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:53,520
plotted it I would have to cut it that

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,440
time don't dungeon husband of days

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,980
let's get the numbers that means

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:17,790
anything yeah but that was voting people

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:19,530
not to say things i would think I think

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:24,060
we need to make sure everybody needs to

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:26,220
be on TV easily that's not like it's not

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,950
about the veto this should be our

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,490
reflect that's not work it should

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,670
reflect the community right it wouldn't

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:38,340
make sense to grow the V juice because

00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:41,090
Robin baby doesn't have a purpose hey

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,090
that's have a purpose

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,890
but i found the numbers and actually it

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:56,030
was right the total number of members is

00:04:51,890 --> 00:05:03,680
missing on most years and by what i know

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:08,300
is that on 205 2005 it was 123 2012 it

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:12,680
was 165 and now it's 100,000 53 so it's

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,800
a bit like this but yeah and personally

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,020
I think that having a lot of members is

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,670
not required that the important thing is

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,180
to having a lot of people who do think

00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,950
and actually good question would be how

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,540
many people we had back then how many

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,630
people we have now and exit something we

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:34,810
cannot know because it's not comfortable

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,810
maybe or maybe these metrics person is

00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:48,050
oh just make sure I understand you

00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:50,559
correctly you ask what the

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:59,569
responsibility of the kitty EV is and

00:05:50,559 --> 00:06:02,919
how to become offer KETV menu ok so to

00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:10,809
stay an active member you have to either

00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:15,199
attendee edgy members of the board yep

00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:17,419
so you as a member you should attend the

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,759
General Assembly which is once a year

00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:27,219
before or during economic you can send a

00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:29,869
proxy for that if you don't do that

00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:32,449
twice in road and you become a passive

00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:37,099
number other than that there are no

00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:41,599
strict requirements of anything you need

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:43,699
to do but in order to really move the

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:45,919
organization and the kitty community

00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:49,009
forward it is of course important that

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:53,719
our members take an active role and do

00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:58,039
things in the Association like help us

00:06:53,719 --> 00:07:02,659
with organizing things and reporting

00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:08,860
things this kind of stuff to become a

00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:11,629
member you find an existing member and

00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,779
see if they would like to propose you as

00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:18,490
a new member then you fill out a small

00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:22,819
survey that is available on evk de dark

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:24,469
and the member who proposes you then son

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,870
said to the membership mailing list

00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:30,470
where two people have to say yes I agree

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:34,170
dispersor should become a member and

00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:41,610
then there's a motive and if that is

00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:44,580
positive you I remember then you become

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,280
famous and there's autograss even theory

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,400
on the street and you get to decide free

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:58,680
software and we teach you to secret

00:07:50,400 --> 00:08:04,610
handshake if you forget you I'm sorry we

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,610
will finish it after after this session

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:32,340
would you say i would say that doing

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:35,010
free software is more than doing the

00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,170
software itself there are other aspects

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,570
and without an organization around it

00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,790
it's basically impossible academy is

00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,240
impossible without the EEG spreads are

00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:48,270
impossible without the EV if people

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,660
value those those assets that the EV

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:54,300
provides i think they should join also

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,400
mainly bless servers all these kind of

00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:02,330
things without the EV are almost

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,330
impossible to keep in a safe way I'd say

00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:14,019
also it helps DV the representative like

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,810
the more people we have the more points

00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:19,990
of view and and different roles of those

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,269
people we have so it's not like we only

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,699
do sprints for coders because there's an

00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:26,889
artist right so if you have more artists

00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:29,130
then they would say we also need like

00:09:26,889 --> 00:10:00,490
the more people were there that the

00:09:29,130 --> 00:10:03,970
feather we are just for me this

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:07,120
information and I'm sure if you like

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:14,410
this about opening organizations to the

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:17,410
Egypt source software that in my feeling

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:20,589
i know it's hard to like to organize a

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:25,139
community this stuff there's much to do

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:34,660
but still asleep

00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:38,069
yes because i dr. divini especially

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:46,809
wonderful ketamine is for me my word is

00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:52,199
very much maybe not because of him but

00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:55,589
because it's much cooler but for example

00:10:52,199 --> 00:11:06,459
for this year to me they wouldn't even

00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:11,199
call follows there was like this is

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:14,729
significant last year look at me how

00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:18,729
would it know mr. bisson who there and

00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:23,739
be afternoon weekly and behave it's

00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:28,179
public information life count how much I

00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:32,889
miss Emily's so this year was a bit

00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:35,319
special in that regard and there was no

00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:38,199
bit bidding process so there were also

00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:40,319
no bits to be published the reason for

00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:43,899
that is that we originally intended to

00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:49,089
do academy in berlin weather with

00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:54,129
another partner that took a very long

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:58,839
time and to get together a local team

00:11:54,129 --> 00:12:01,029
that had potential for that and it was

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,889
very important for that partner to have

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,889
that in berlin and at a certain time

00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:15,129
ultimately way too late in the process

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:18,929
this fellow's room day bed out so we as

00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:24,369
support basically had to do last minute

00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:26,660
talking to people we know to get this

00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:29,449
event rolling

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:33,050
and I'm very thankful for the local team

00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:38,149
here who agreed to what is what was kind

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:40,730
of crazy so yes this shouldn't happen

00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:43,639
again in this case it was unfortunate

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:47,060
but out of our hands but I agree with

00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:51,949
you in the future that none should be

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:54,800
better also if you had been a member you

00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:56,449
probably with an ID mentioned that the

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,310
only benefit for you were would have

00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:00,110
been having more information I'm

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,959
actually not sure we have the

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,759
information earlier to the members you

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,860
wouldn't have as your benefit wouldn't

00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,339
be high cap more information I don't

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,949
think we give much more information to

00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:16,639
the members that we give to the bottom

00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:18,829
like almost everything we try with we

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,720
give I mean there is discussion right

00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:25,160
those discussions are private but the

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,540
outcome of them I mean I'm bias right

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,939
because I know everything so it's hard

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,670
to meet you to know what the other

00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:34,819
people don't know but I have the feeling

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,899
that we at least by definition we try to

00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:40,899
deliver a man we might miss something

00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:40,899
even

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:58,780
discussions like maybe proposing to the

00:13:49,970 --> 00:14:02,960
English actually we are ready to that

00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,970
maybe we should send more things to the

00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,440
community amenities but whenever there

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,930
is something to be communicated we

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,990
always discuss maybe we can put it to

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,880
the community manga stand well when you

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,510
see that we do it because we decided and

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,730
actually if you ask member you will see

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,040
that the traffic is not huge over there

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,020
and actually mostly the traffic that

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,480
it's on the membership making this is

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,130
because there's needs to that with other

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,580
things that we need to figure out and

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:33,790
that we need to figure out us as as a

00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,790
noir ganization

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:17,510
discussion which I feel should we be

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,510
happy there most articles on as planned

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,839
because websites back faronics will

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,000
start renovated and they want to avoid

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:33,540
it on the other hand the discussions

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:37,589
that follow you might be placed me in

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:41,930
alias I'm disabilities anyone because I

00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:41,930
joined us discuss mr. middle finger but

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:54,269
they should be there but it's something

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:57,899
that next yeah it's it's hard to draw

00:15:54,269 --> 00:16:00,660
the binary for example the compilation

00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:03,240
mailing list it's all public as far as I

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:06,570
understand but also as my ass in this

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,399
time there is the non official group of

00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,410
people that mail each other that

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,459
happened to be on the foundation for the

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,720
things that they might to go public so

00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:18,360
it's the thing right you make it there

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,769
everything public and then it doesn't

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,269
mean everything will be public anyway

00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:23,720
because people will start mailing them

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,720
selves

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,649
was like oh yes this is exciting I

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:42,070
wouldn't get against all kinds of super

00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:44,410
many lists which was embarrassing so as

00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,149
a new board member of que te veo may get

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:56,680
access to one secret mailing list and

00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:59,070
that is the board my name is clearly the

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:22,030
secret handshake is not a meaningless

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:28,120
you learn it in the street public and

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:30,370
there was one figure so there was me

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:38,140
this is this project is the multi

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:44,520
project could be maybe if it's like me

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:44,520
she because it would be to know

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:55,500
so are you talking about what is it ring

00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:58,190
yeah that basically wasn't discussed on

00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:20,070
membership maintenance as far as i know

00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:23,880
so that is not an easy thing to get

00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:27,659
stripped of I don't know what they did

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,429
for me John far as I know they were not

00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:32,029
complying one hundred percent with the

00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:34,649
manifesto there were some issues that

00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:38,159
they didn't want to comply but the

00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:44,730
manifesto is the reason to stay and the

00:18:38,159 --> 00:19:35,610
thing to comply so the developer of ring

00:18:44,730 --> 00:20:32,039
KD is around here so there's many

00:19:35,610 --> 00:20:35,159
projects on it but I don't think that

00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:37,620
the question I don't think that the

00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,330
question was whether it was a problem or

00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,890
not he was just complaining that he

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,890
didn't know about the backstory

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:59,800
I just the follow-up of that I mean I

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,780
understand why we do want to know I

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,610
wanted to know and everybody wanted to

00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,730
know but there's there are some things

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:10,750
that maybe it makes sense not saying

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:13,660
like we kick out someone I mean let's

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:17,320
imagine someone does sexual harassment

00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:22,540
right you I mean you want to give it as

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:24,600
a no maybe you're Muslim yeah like the

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,280
people like a need-to-know basis earnest

00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,930
sure it's not a good comparison that it

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,690
is similar right so they broke the

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:34,440
manifesto which is broke it's breaking

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,440
our laws right

00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:01,730
so I were connected

00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:22,440
I think who is

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:33,240
people started to make judgments based

00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:35,670
in this specific project and when we

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,670
really loved us in some mechanisms which

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:42,330
make sure that we ask for information

00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:47,100
communication so this I'm not sure who

00:22:42,330 --> 00:23:01,770
moved how this should make the entity

00:22:47,100 --> 00:23:03,930
the expectation well maybe it's not

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:06,750
about transparency per se it's more

00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,430
about processes right i mean the process

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,110
needs to be transparent maybe the

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,480
outcome doesn't really need to be all

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,310
that transparent but I agreed that since

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,200
I mean probably as a lot of power

00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,420
nowadays and it's not only on these

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,110
subjects I was talking to a second

00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,300
person a couple of days ago and yeah so

00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,040
it's it's definitely narrow there needs

00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:30,290
to be more communication in some areas

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,290
but that's why we're here in

00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:40,760
we need to trust our systems because

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:54,200
they do they pretty color whether they

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:56,570
choose to administer it or not but it's

00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,720
not about trust it's about sharing the

00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,720
weight

00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:20,770
nobody is asking anything I love you

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:23,140
safe I so there is lots of key members

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:26,170
here I like them I like to encourage

00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:29,500
them to run for the fort it is a very

00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:33,400
important place we will eventually have

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:37,540
people that pushed Armstrong out mine

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:45,340
next year so it is good that people

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:51,190
think about their feature on the EV one

00:24:45,340 --> 00:25:05,380
year in the future who knows do you plan

00:24:51,190 --> 00:25:08,200
to run I know get give him that it was

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:13,750
not clever they bit let it go just

00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:18,430
cheeky and and low so who is going to

00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:22,980
apply to the door anyone know or you can

00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:22,980
think about it it's kind of cognitive

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:37,750
you don't agree I think you are ready

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,450
what about it at least for a part of a

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:46,300
second you are seeing yourself back to

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:49,080
board with our secret handshake of

00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,080
course

00:25:52,419 --> 00:26:00,690
Oh Kimmy let's we have a nice desktop

00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:11,830
I'm sorry okay d course the people is

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,720
but everyone says although what I like

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:16,929
about katie is that I can do my thing

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,090
and reaches to ppl makes an impact I

00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:21,820
think this is awesome it's impossible to

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:25,080
do something like that anywhere else so

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:29,049
easily and with so such good company

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,480
it's the place to things and have an

00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:35,230
impact even if it's just on some geeks

00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:43,779
or maybe not that gates but see what

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:45,850
people it's pretty good comparing to

00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:49,239
some other communities I'm a part of I

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:53,109
think it's most amazing that at our size

00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:59,730
we managed to have a relatively diverse

00:26:53,109 --> 00:27:02,440
and different community and still

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:05,289
managed to have useful conversations

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:13,200
without screaming at each other I think

00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:13,200
that's amazing I have to say something

00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:31,869
the coolest thing about Kelly and yeah

00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:35,169
people is the more Epiphone answer for

00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:39,309
that but I think that's also a great

00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:42,039
opportunity to make a you being there

00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:44,980
often a little bit outside of your

00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:50,169
comfort zone for having new challenge

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:52,060
and just to to keep yourself push

00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:57,770
yourself a little bit

00:27:52,060 --> 00:28:00,680
each day so it's a very cool place for

00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:07,670
for learning and for sharing experience

00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:12,700
and two children to live the benefits of

00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:12,700
free software to all parts of the world

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,250
and it's just told something I just not

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:21,620
about yeah the learning part is awesome

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:24,430
and it's not only the learning part that

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:27,920
people will will let you do things i

00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:30,650
remember back when i was young so there

00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:33,980
was this k PDF thing and it needed

00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,420
porting 2x PDF 3 something light and i

00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,940
sent an email saying yeah i'll do it

00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,710
like how hard can it be right and and I

00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,120
nobody said now now you're to nearly

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,120
right because I was a nearly like that

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,040
and and it took me months of holidays to

00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,150
do it but I did it eventually right sir

00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:53,200
there's this sure you can try and nobody

00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:57,040
will tell you the only will shut down

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,040
that's that's pretty neat

00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,140
