Title: Jan Kundrat - Trojitá: A Fast IMAP Email Client - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Do you read lots of e-mails? Would you like to open a mailbox with 100,000 messages in a couple of seconds? If so, you might want to give Trojitá a try.

Trojitá is a fast Qt IMAP e-mail client.

Our mission is to deliver an application which:

* Enables you to access your mail anytime, anywhere.
* Does not slow you down. If we can improve the productivity of an e-mail user, we better do.
* Respects open standards and facilitate modern technologies. We value the vendor-neutrality that IMAP provides and are committed to be as interoperable as possible.
* Is efficient — be it at conserving the network bandwidth, keeping memory use at a reasonable level or not hogging the system's CPU.
* Can be used on many platforms. One UI is not enough for everyone, but our IMAP core works fine on anything from desktop computers to cell phones and big ERP systems.
* Plays well with the rest of the ecosystem. We don't like reinventing wheels, but when the existing wheels quite don't fit the tracks, we're not afraid of making them work.

	00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,090
ison is a better

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,280
so I gather myself and this talk is

00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:21,260
going to be about

00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:23,990
which I stood at Google years ago you

00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,780
might ask why do we actually motor with

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,030
setting up email clients and you know

00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,460
starting awards from scratches sorry new

00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,460
email clients from scratch the thing is

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,760
i think that Toyota is a particularly

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,010
fast one and when I say fast really mean

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,379
it I mean we have it written on our

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,360
website and whatever a new user jemison

00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:45,739
you know price Garza throw it out for

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,330
the first time they were really

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:50,540
surprised that it actually happens to be

00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:53,269
fast which is why I like to show you a

00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,110
quick demo it will who is going to work

00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:56,110
dinner

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,790
excellent no so what I'm going to do in

00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,590
this table is you know just a very

00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,930
simple benchmark how much time does it

00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,580
take to open the mailbox which contain

00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,690
something like half a million female

00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,250
messages and I can do in a secret is

00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,509
going to take 15 seconds which seems

00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,670
like an eternity when you're sitting

00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:36,070
here standing here so I'm going to click

00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,140
it looks right now and you can see what

00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,540
you can see on the right is a very

00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:43,479
sexually so Congress going on the email

00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,759
messages are starting to load and it's

00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,860
still very slow because you know all the

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,080
caches are actually called there is no

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,950
participation type disabled it on

00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,930
purpose or for this demonstration and

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,600
yeah it's also using a debug build of

00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,119
gate 5 you know a big ol pile but it

00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,340
sounds very fast so it was very quickly

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,380
what you can do is change nobody works

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,380
you know it goes up when I came back to

00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:14,880
the the original how familiar email

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,200
messages pink is going to look very

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:25,150
quickly you know something like two

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:29,079
seconds so no it was why you know why

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:32,940
exactly is it so fast so the biggest

00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:35,560
reason is lazy loading which is that

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,660
director doesn't actually know load

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,820
anything which is not needed it's been

00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:43,050
skinny little in the city starts to

00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,510
start to appear you know when everything

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,510
let's go fly it's simple flashing which

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,770
you can see is that you know these are

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:55,310
some placeholder messages another reason

00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,380
the other reason for being so fast is

00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:02,880
data doing as much as possible to nate

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:06,330
I'm observer which means for example if

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,040
if we are searching from the ingles the

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,900
search is not actually going to do

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,700
happen over your device but it's all

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,850
down to own server site on which you get

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,120
back is just a result and the of course

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,290
everything is cash it means uh whatever

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,320
whatever something was already done with

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,560
it it really won't you give elated over

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,180
and over again um if you open if you

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,790
open an email which contains a huge

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,240
attachment for example the picture of

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,610
your friends gates of whatever different

00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,970
language three hours SQ is asking the

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,440
server for a structure of the email and

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,140
you get back look quite a combined data

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,800
structure and you see just the just the

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,250
textual content of the email and uh yeah

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,000
the attachments on hold it only we need

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,400
it there is of course a cage with this

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,090
and the gauge our code prepay on web

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,360
service or actually two sorts of great

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,640
I'm observers the first of them are more

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,709
was harmless because you know if I'll an

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,080
operation is just slower or takes a

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,630
little more time or or you know

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,180
transferable data doesn't feel better um

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:19,980
what is a little bit more annoying are

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,580
I'm observers picture which like some

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,940
features for example and you know this

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,919
is quite an iphone of an quested feature

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,290
there is Gmail which unfortunately

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,050
doesn't really support all you know

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,169
email Friday organizations showing

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,090
messages and Fred's different is gmail

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,310
actually does support something very

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,160
similar but a cage is they are doing

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,900
this in non-standard manner and I mean

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,460
it would be really terrific to have you

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,830
know a new feature with intricate

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,510
knowledge which would add support for

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,460
this thing that's so far but it's

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:58,770
contributed it yet but you know we're

00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:00,479
open for accepting position I mean I can

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,640
show you a couple or I can tell you a

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,780
couple of numbers or statistics we

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:09,090
started in 2006 now we joined PD in 2012

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,800
which is actually a value where it

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:15,150
actually became feasible for day-to-day

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,180
work and I mean join indicating it was

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,539
quite really nice experience especially

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,590
the summer of code and google code in

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,479
competitions or well collaboration

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,479
current leader who is sitting right

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,600
there right-eo is one of our selected

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,340
students and you know working with all

00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,450
the new guys was something which I

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,030
really liked and so far more than 70

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:42,720
people's contributed to hit up which is

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,460
what nice think I'm not including

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,930
translators equals in translations of

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,030
elephants support repository and yeah if

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,250
we are speaking about the size of the

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,890
project these numbers are really really

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,500
you know something like estimates and I

00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,409
think that on the complexity scale we

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,619
are roughly comparable to other okay

00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:05,239
or or say the optimization something in

00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:08,149
between you know it really depends on

00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:13,249
what sort of four metric you will look

00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:17,479
at about your roadmap you maybe I've

00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:21,679
seen when I showed the user interface

00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:23,809
it's sort of simple and noted said like

00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:26,119
that's a feature but the thing is really

00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:28,639
only support a single email single email

00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:32,889
account which is sort of you know

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,779
useless limitation and so the work which

00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,519
just needed to get rid of this notation

00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:39,579
it's something which I saw something

00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:42,589
like a high priority organ for us and

00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:46,939
you know what still like of time at work

00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:50,239
um I think that all the technical errors

00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:52,699
are in place in you this is just what

00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:55,309
was I'm going to fix in a couple of the

00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,829
wii UI classes but yeah it's still still

00:06:55,309 --> 00:07:02,119
down another frame which we want to do

00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:03,439
in the future is integrating the work

00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:05,289
which another sovereign student

00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,550
different once it's done it's about

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:12,199
finally supporting open pgp encryption

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:14,959
it's something else oh yeah and there is

00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,879
the final think maybe some of you might

00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,219
be familiar with what a given to phone

00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,199
think so very reason they're definitely

00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:25,969
require which is called eco which is

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,889
based on Rita they are essentially 40

00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:30,649
code base and I think it'll be terrific

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,599
if we can somehow merge it back so you

00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:34,699
have to stay just a single project but

00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,979
I'm not sure whether this is going to

00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:40,189
ever happen you know yeah I think this

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:44,139
is all that I have sorry once again for

00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:44,139
the huge delay with extra hundred

00:07:52,009 --> 00:08:10,370
if we have some time for questions

00:07:53,819 --> 00:08:13,319
regarding the solution and it stays like

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:16,919
what we ended up doing is insanity and

00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:20,729
you say unfortunately use this the

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:25,770
command line interface for for 4.jpg I

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:28,710
think well you know if there is a choice

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:31,080
between a PDF library which is

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:34,320
distributed with Katie which you say

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:46,440
this with you know look like an obvious

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:47,519
first choice sorry okay well yeah I

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,190
think they're looking at possible as

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,959
well that's you know I think you know

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,510
any kind of library is going to work I

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:57,029
mean maybe I wasn't clear enough we are

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,699
using to you see a library and you see a

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:02,940
library already handles everything which

00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:06,320
we need so yeah it's essentially just a

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,320
huge wraparound something

00:09:40,860 --> 00:10:06,880
mobile that was it done for elbows yep I

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,340
think it's great and you know I've quite

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,140
a lot of stuff Jerry to take care of in

00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,240
you know professional life helpers alive

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,370
but I think this makes a lot of lot of

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,680
sense gee I mean this is quite

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,260
specifically an audible big thing for

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,100
lucky that and I think makes a lot of

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:28,620
sense and in fact i think that you know

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:31,770
stuff which was done for the mountain or

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,500
okay mr. Milligan and also what what was

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,840
down by both us and the even two guys

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,520
for freaking it's actually you know

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,430
whereas quite a long way towards you

00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:45,990
know just we can equivalently user

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:47,430
interface or for something so i think it

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,000
with terrific you know i'll be very very

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,000
happy to help

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,450
