	KDE has a long history of delivering great end-user software. We are changing. The world around us is changing. We need to take charge so we can continue to deliver free and open software at a time when our users need it the most.

KDE has a long history of delivering great end-user software. We are changing. The world around us is changing. We need to take charge so we can continue to deliver free and open software at a time when our users need it the most.

Where are we? Where do we want to go? How do we get there? These are the questions we need to ask ourselves and find answers to. Evolving KDE started with a survey to get broad input on these questions. Let's have a look at the results and what they mean for KDE's future.

	00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:20,000
all right good morning um thank you for

00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,260
waking everyone up thank you for being a

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,599
wedding let's talk a bit about a woven

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:31,970
ke and how we can shape our future it's

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:37,430
been long time since much as it was

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:47,809
wrote this email that started KD that

00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:51,800
was in 1969 and 96 sorry you're awake

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:56,030
very good oh and wonderful things he

00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,090
writes is unique popularity crows thanks

00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,789
to the free variance mostly Linux but

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,730
still a consistent nice-looking free

00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:07,100
desktop environment is missing there are

00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,920
several knives at the free or low priced

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,650
applications available so that linux x11

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,490
would most almost fit everybody's needs

00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:21,920
if he could offer a real gooey that was

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:28,640
almost 20 years ago I think we can say

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:34,700
we have that but the water honest is

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:38,090
changing we have mobile phones we have

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:42,079
smart watches and we have these weird

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:45,640
things and all of us know that this is

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:49,610
happening all of us feel that yes

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:52,340
technology rawness is evolving in many

00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:55,840
many different ways but it seems to me

00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:01,040
that for a long time we've been kind of

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,079
not acknowledging it as a community

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,899
individual people definitely but as a

00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:11,210
community we've been kind of like a deer

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:16,400
in a headlight Sol Sol runners is

00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:19,900
changing so are we this is a beautiful

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:30,350
place but is it be

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:33,170
growing and not taking enough care of no

00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:37,850
one took the time to take away few

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:43,430
things to remove some unnecessary pieces

00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:46,640
or some unhealthy pieces and I think we

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:52,340
have kind of the same situation in our

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:56,380
community so we need to look at where we

00:02:52,340 --> 00:03:00,440
actually are and what we want to do to

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:06,080
get us ready for the future and this is

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:10,010
where I well when Katie comes in it's

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,700
basically an effort to try to get us to

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:18,130
look at where are we who are we where do

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:23,989
we want to go and how do we get us there

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:29,390
we started out with a survey to as

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:31,959
everyone our contributors or users about

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:37,910
their opinions their feelings and their

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:40,640
view on our ecosystem and what I'm going

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:44,390
to talk about in the next few minutes is

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:50,030
what we took out of those answers that

00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:55,340
people gave us so first on topic of we

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:58,580
actually are we we have a great

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,940
community people appreciate that we are

00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,010
friendly that we are open that it is

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:09,410
very easy to find someone who can help

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:12,970
you with a problem we meet at academy we

00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:17,630
make here there's a lot of very good

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:20,690
social interactions as one of the people

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,070
who filled out the survey said there's

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,200
the sense of working for the greater

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,600
good that drives the community is

00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,950
welcoming and friendly and able to

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,380
integrate people from very different

00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,260
backgrounds and cultures

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:36,270
for me it represents the ideal of what a

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:42,400
free software community should be I

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:47,290
think that sums it up very nicely we

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:51,670
have great technology people will rave

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:54,670
about Britain for example we have pretty

00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:58,300
cagey frameworks 5 which is getting used

00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,430
in all kinds of places now and which

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,270
really can take our technology to more

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:08,380
places than it ever has been before and

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:10,630
we should be proud of that we are a

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,520
place where people can have an impact a

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:16,870
real impact on the world where people

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:24,700
can really make a difference and it is

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:26,260
something they well you it's my friend

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:37,270
machines this is the t-shirt he always

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:40,210
wears when he flies we r place where we

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,820
really provide users with your tools

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,890
they need to be free to keep their

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:51,910
freedom in a world where this is more

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:54,520
necessary than ever we are a place where

00:05:51,910 --> 00:06:00,760
people can scratch their own edge I can

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:02,830
really solve their own problems we are a

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,000
place for learning where people can grow

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:09,160
and learn how to interact in a global

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,900
diverse community where people can learn

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:16,840
to program where people can learn to

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:18,070
work in really complex systems and we

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,380
should be really proud of all the

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,710
mentoring we do

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,750
through what was a mouth cod season of

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:29,220
KDE and all the other unstructured

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,480
learning and mentoring that we do and

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,820
one of the people who filled out the

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,820
survey said the right variety of people

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:39,530
involved in the past years it did teach

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,530
me to see the world in different ways

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,540
but there's also tell things people say

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,360
they don't find the time and energy to

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,140
contribute to Katie which is an

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,700
indication for me that they don't

00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,790
prioritize and hired and a lot of other

00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:04,080
things in their life which might be fair

00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:09,780
but maybe in some places that priority

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:12,600
should be shifted some people say they

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,870
have a really hard time to see how they

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,780
can get started how dare skills can be

00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:21,270
useful for us we still seem to failure

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,260
despite all our efforts to really show

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,690
people and it's very easy to get into ke

00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:30,630
that it's very easy to start with

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,460
something really small we spent so much

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,850
effort on that and still it doesn't seem

00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,850
to stick

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:46,390
william strategy and focus we don't

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:50,680
really have it and people feel that and

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:53,470
people demand it and one interesting

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,980
thing someone said was why we are not

00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:01,420
always moving in the same direction we

00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:03,100
always want to move forward which I

00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:09,820
think sums it up nicely different

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:11,770
situation but that brings me to where do

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,920
we actually want to go where do we want

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,540
to tell all that energy that we have and

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,070
all the good ideas that we have and all

00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:25,810
the talent that we have to figure that

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:29,500
out we definitely need vision strategy

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:32,970
and focus which things should we be

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,970
concentrating on what should we be doing

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,940
so some of the things people say is for

00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:43,140
example we should be on more devices we

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:46,540
should be in the cloud we should be

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,230
defending users freedoms there we should

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,060
be giving them a conversion experience

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,360
no matter which device they use they're

00:08:52,060 --> 00:09:01,960
going to have KD on it and they want it

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:04,540
to be a seamless experience people want

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:08,980
us to create truly excellent software

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:12,040
that is not just better than any other

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,430
free software but that is really truly

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:20,770
excellent and can compete with whatever

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:22,870
is out there and that is hard but it's

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:28,890
doable as some of us in the community

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:31,780
have shown at the same time we need to

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:37,780
continue to stay friendly and open and

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:42,220
this will be a struggle people want us

00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:45,510
to continue to defend freedom both by

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,970
providing them with real free

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,519
journalists will

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,800
have to prepare herself and that is out

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,800
there that is infringing on their on

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:59,300
their rights and on their freedom and at

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,370
the same time we should be collaborating

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,490
more with other organizations to

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:08,240
advocate for some of the things that are

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:14,209
wrong and that hinder our work and it

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,740
you know people's freedom which brings

00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:19,930
me to more concentration on a bigger

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:23,600
picture over the last year's we have

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:27,560
spent so much time on ourselves that we

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:31,759
sometimes lost the focus of where we are

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:34,490
in a much bigger ecosystem how we how we

00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,470
fit together with other organizations

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,250
how will how we see our role in the

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:45,709
world and that is something people want

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:47,089
to see changed the good thing is we're

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:50,089
actually partied out already we have

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:54,949
cases where parts of our community

00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:57,199
really do this we have creature for

00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:59,389
example which was named so many times as

00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:02,480
one of the project that has a vision

00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:05,180
that is truly excellent that can compete

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,980
with whatever is out there we have

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:12,470
things like KDE connect that really

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:16,639
brings us this connection between we're

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:20,269
aware and very future is we have ktv

00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:23,029
frameworks five that we brings us out of

00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:30,379
the usual suspects that we've been

00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:34,189
serving so far so how do we get the rest

00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:38,600
of us there there are five things that

00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:41,779
we need to do the first of which is we

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:47,899
need to find a way for us to define a

00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:49,670
vision a strategy and focus how we're

00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,069
going to do this is something we need to

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:55,089
discuss over the next year or the next

00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:55,089
week or next month

00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:02,230
once we have that we actually need to

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,449
have a really hard look at all the

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,499
things that we have been doing over the

00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:12,189
past 19 years and figure out which of

00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:15,069
those are still useful in a way we have

00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:20,759
them which of those need to be tweet and

00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:24,839
which of those maybe we need to stop how

00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:28,899
how are we going to do that I'll without

00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:33,429
original strategy and focus so we need

00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:35,709
that first being having that allows us

00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:38,819
to say no and that allows us to say yes

00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:44,619
to many many different other things and

00:12:38,819 --> 00:12:46,449
this is something we really need the

00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:49,569
third thing we need to do is really have

00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:53,919
a look at our current ongoing processes

00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:59,019
and how we show people how to get into

00:12:53,919 --> 00:13:02,980
this community how to get started so

00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:06,419
many different sub-projects have junior

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:10,779
jobs getting started guides and so on

00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:14,470
but we have no clear pipeline to get

00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:18,669
people there we need to fix that we need

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:25,389
to simplify make here or give them

00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:29,169
better tools to get started our main web

00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:31,720
presence we really need better message

00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:34,329
and clear page there we really need to

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,119
make it easier for people to understand

00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:42,160
who we are and to get them to what they

00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:46,989
really want our current represents isn't

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,299
throwing that and the first point we

00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:54,249
need to look at all our outreach menus

00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:57,620
social media the dot planet and so on

00:13:54,249 --> 00:14:00,850
and we find ways to improve them

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:07,270
we reach a wider audience with our

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:11,140
message now none of those can be done

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:14,120
without the contribution from all of you

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:17,470
so please think about what's the one

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:21,529
small thing you can do to get us there

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:28,330
what's the next step that you can take

00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:33,620
to help make that happen and we have

00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:35,690
above on on Monday tomorrow and I hope

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,570
to see many of you dare to discuss this

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:44,170
and we have some time here for questions

00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:44,170
as well now other questions

00:14:52,550 --> 00:15:39,029
Frederick will fade away do you already

00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:42,199
have oh yes I have some ideas and I

00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:47,310
think we should start by the things like

00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:51,709
why do we have so many music players why

00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,709
do we have several screenshot programs

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,720
we should really take a look why and

00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,079
find a good reason find a good answer to

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,079
that question

00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:15,140
so you said we should say no we should

00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:19,459
focus on strategy so we can we do it we

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:22,279
don't so hungry one of the great things

00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:24,560
is there many people bring their people

00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:27,230
come with their own ideas and actually

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,959
for the web own community for all kinds

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:33,230
of crazy ideas but people just have to

00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:36,500
ask fighting injustice and ask us

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:40,579
together as one of the various we work

00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:45,579
together community so is there to say

00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:45,579
anything operation where you

00:16:48,800 --> 00:17:03,829
we also do crazies and I think i erase

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:08,790
you breathe which i think is very

00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:12,770
consistent very nice is an amazing step

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:20,459
forward and still allows us to have

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:23,400
tracy other things we say no doesn't

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:26,819
necessarily mean it can't be done but we

00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,580
as a community need to say this is what

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:31,680
we concentrate on and this is what we

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:35,130
don't concentrate on anyone else boluda

00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,020
that's fine they could continue to do

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,930
that and maybe that's exactly the way

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:45,810
how we get crazy new ideas for the next

00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:48,230
20 years and that's fine but unless we

00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,610
have a clearer story about ourselves

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,700
it's very hard for people from the

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,730
outside to say okay this is where I

00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:00,390
belong this is where that I what I can

00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:05,510
associate with this is this is a line

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:12,210
with myself and I know this isn't going

00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:15,870
to be easy and I know that some some

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:19,920
people disagree with that and it's I

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:24,750
think okay because the place we are in

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:27,980
right now is not sustainable you just

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,720
had an ice storm this morning about how

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,540
less and less people in generally a

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:39,510
general contribute to free software or

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:44,430
to volunteer courses like what was it a

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:46,470
firefighter and concentrate more on for

00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:50,130
example oh I want to do this great start

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,370
I want to raise a lot of money and

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,390
you're seeing this

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,950
in the number of people from India for

00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:01,510
example apply for who is enough core

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:05,230
programs instead of saying I could make

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,300
should a lot of money if I start a

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,650
start-up which is probably not going to

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:16,330
happen but that's something people

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:19,630
thinking we need to counter that we need

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:32,410
to find ways to to be more attractive

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:42,309
again and to find out focused every time

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:45,460
you turn around I just mentioned also a

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:50,280
disability guys wait because I was still

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,280
looking for really possible

00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:06,410
and it may is my father's professional

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:15,810
so good professionally

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:18,420
as the default whole point of our simple

00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:22,230
as that alternates powerful needed is

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:25,650
really used that I think at least all

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:30,240
the program modifications that are in

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:34,680
the main repository are to fight obesity

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:38,700
other expert here and play down it's a

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,940
trailer which is there for playing

00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:49,740
around and I'm cute i've played

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:56,870
expertise so it would be really very

00:20:49,740 --> 00:21:01,670
cool f KD whatever it is that space i

00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:04,440
would be the perfect systems at least

00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,950
Volturi one of the lady was Olivia's

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,950
these days

00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,150
I

00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,340
morteza process

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:37,590
I was missing first step for mentioned

00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:41,790
or rather what is d so we have to define

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:46,490
the week and is not a technology that's

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:51,990
a lot of looking at katies the

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:56,130
technology to her so does the system or

00:21:51,990 --> 00:22:01,380
only nucleus really but from I

00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:05,270
understand the key if he and quality was

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:14,480
always not ultimately and stay out

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:18,710
people in in Iowa loop so my question is

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,710
you have the survey

00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:28,200
see that so what has the communities in

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:31,140
what they'd like to go to see that's

00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,630
basically the things I I mentioned as

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,810
this is where we are and this is where

00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:39,540
we want to go if you want access to the

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:42,000
Royal data I can give that to you there

00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:55,800
is a written summary on the kid

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:59,490
community list okay and so I'm trying to

00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,920
ensure people took the survey roughly

00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,940
half of those where users and roughly

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:10,110
half of those where existing

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:13,140
contributors most of them or a good part

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:17,310
of them came from Europe and the people

00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:21,420
who contributed contribute for five

00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:23,300
years or more most of the time yes that

00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:27,890
is what I have in mind right now but

00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,890
yeah there there's more online

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:51,899
you have exercised yes my plan is to

00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,299
write this up as a blog post over the

00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:55,799
next days and I can also put up my

00:23:54,299 --> 00:24:05,600
slides but I don't think they're too

00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:05,600
useful without commentary more questions

00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:39,259
who does who does the size we don't just

00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:39,259
listen is what happens

00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:50,980
and maybe focus on that attractive plant

00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,980
was 16 yrs issues but that's very good

00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:14,180
and that's the big day today um honestly

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,760
I don't think so because again look at

00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:22,160
kita look at please look at crazy

00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,990
Phillips five they were all done to

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,090
scratch an itch and two to solve a

00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:31,640
problem but at the same time these teams

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:35,270
managed to get a clear goal and to sign

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:38,450
their part and to really succeed at what

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:41,600
they had planned and we can do that in

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:45,290
more places without compromising what

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,630
what we have been we just need to find a

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:51,010
way how to do that and it's possible we

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,010
have shown that we can do that

00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:25,560
to both provide Beautiful's neither mean

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:28,930
what needs me there I'm actually rather

00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:40,060
old source communities that produce

00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:42,760
multiple products there's no attitude in

00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:49,450
terms of brandy what's the community

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:53,400
versus product and instantly imagine

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,400
exactly what it is that they work

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:37,330
there was a time when it was yeah yeah I

00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:43,059
have my feet didn't several other

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:47,019
projects as well and 41 I am familiar

00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:51,149
with its I think one of two cases either

00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:56,619
it's a big struggle just like we have it

00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:58,299
or it's very top down this is what we

00:27:56,619 --> 00:28:01,840
are and you're either on board or not

00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:03,909
and I hope we can find a way somewhere

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,679
in between and we have to figure out how

00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:10,529
to do them and looking at more other

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,529
projects i think is a very good start

00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:33,670
we are a friendly community no fighting

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:37,950
here okay say I think television doesn't

00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,950
go away time

00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:13,930
and again we have done the same thing

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,870
for a manifesto and I think it has

00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:21,750
really benefited us in having a clearer

00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,750
answer to is this house forest is not us

00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:22,820
we want to see even a movie n plus 1

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:22,820
musically a project that

00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:37,280
yes so it's not about dieter yeah so

00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,890
it's not about telling the and

00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,799
crossbones music player you can't come

00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,410
here but it's about saying okay you can

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:48,640
be the n plus ones but the first one is

00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:52,160
the one we focus on this is where our

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,720
resources go this is where we

00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,700
concentrate on this is what we market

00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,220
this is what we recommend to our users

00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,490
and if your helpers one and you get so

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:12,820
much better than the first one maybe

00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:12,820
then you should be number one but yes we

00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:26,809
ve G to propose the park to start a

00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:29,470
process of finding 54kg and then we

00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:29,470
gotta

00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:38,080
presented and that was such a huge

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:57,580
package that we each time we were

00:31:38,080 --> 00:32:00,610
together so do I community that um the

00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:03,250
survey was the first step to show okay

00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:05,880
so many people believe that this is

00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:08,680
something we really should be working on

00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,930
and the other thing is I think we really

00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:14,440
should look at what what has faith in a

00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:17,260
passive way and see how we can do that

00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,470
in a different way I don't have the

00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:23,040
answer yet but please come to the buffer

00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,040
and let's talk

00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:40,940
so the light appears for the last year

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,940
that we

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:52,920
that's something which overtime rules

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,730
credit me and brought me closer because

00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:59,900
I know

00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:03,340
are you getting for the other part circa

00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:06,350
my respected guarantee near there

00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:10,510
occasionally the standard but upset or

00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:13,510
also application you know the quality

00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,510
really

00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:36,240
such as per usual does work usually

00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:39,100
around world usually creatures and

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,639
halibut please do not work you have to

00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:45,519
be a gel to be it as how you have to get

00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:49,620
people that we actually search engine

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:54,690
plant uniting the time community under a

00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:58,240
vision that we will follow a narc which

00:33:54,690 --> 00:34:02,499
is all terribly and we monitor which is

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:06,279
fun you fast changing be working and

00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:10,000
trying to fix violation and in that

00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:13,510
regard I actually believed was my

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,970
vitamin B let's just spirits and these

00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:22,869
will have a completely successful

00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:26,669
critically is a product returns services

00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:26,669
and filter like this

00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:55,730
so I've been on board for four years now

00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:57,650
in kidding me almost 10 and what I'm

00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:00,559
seeing is that people are desperately

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:05,000
waiting for this to happen and it

00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:09,980
doesn't really happen except for the

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:15,859
cases we mentioned already so some help

00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:19,220
is needed and unless so we can decide

00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:24,260
that we don't want to do that but then

00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:26,540
it's not going to happen that's if

00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:29,720
that's what we want that's fine but from

00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:45,920
the other comments I sense that that is

00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:53,440
not the case yeah d got folks whose

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:58,549
dimensions and frameworks plasmas where

00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:04,510
these seeds from my duty be one or two

00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:04,510
people in each case have come up with

00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:18,460
is if we want to create a focus as I do

00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:22,940
you think we're going to need Pete like

00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:28,640
those of people to leave that followed

00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:31,340
up and it's not dangerous to have so

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:39,020
much to the leadership positions into

00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:46,310
the node is this post david has not when

00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:50,270
you get once without it yes um yes I

00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:52,070
think so and I don't have to perfect on

00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,660
sorted out yet and I think this is

00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:59,510
something we should be discussing down

00:36:53,660 --> 00:37:03,620
and looking at the time yes this is joy

00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:13,960
luck let's disagree and agree disagree

00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:13,960
again let's discuss right now thank you

00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,350
you

00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:30,609
