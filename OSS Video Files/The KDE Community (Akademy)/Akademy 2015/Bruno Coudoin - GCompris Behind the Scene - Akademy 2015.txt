Title: Bruno Coudoin - GCompris Behind the Scene - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	GCompris came to KDE one year ago with the promise to reborn itself as a Qt Quick application. Why did we made a so radical choice, and what are our success and failures so far.

Doing a multi-platform application that spans all major desktops and mobiles operating systems is cumbersome even with the help of Qt Quick. We will see the major difficulties we are facing.

Beside the technical aspect, we already have an official release on Android and we will share some numbers on how GCompris performs on this platform.

At last, we will give some explanation and some figures about the commercial effort behind GCompris that started more than 10 years ago and continues with the Android version.

	00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:20,240
thank you yeah shakin pretty you turn

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:27,079
the lift a lot of four habra I was

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:30,290
supposed to say so gee comfy started in

00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:34,940
two thousand it's used in many many many

00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:37,280
places many schools even on place where

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,870
I didn't even imagine it could be used

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,350
like in hospitals to do some real

00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,450
education or surprises so you can you

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,290
can use it in many many places because

00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:52,190
originally written in gtk and started to

00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:55,730
bawl compute quick in general I 92,000

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:59,710
for and it's still in progress we say oh

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,880
we are are we are progressing on that

00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:05,540
it's just something special about you

00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,969
complete that there is also a commercial

00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,240
for behind the beyond the project we

00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:15,770
will see a little bit how it works wire

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,960
why we do this but originally the idea

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,930
was to give an advantage to the new

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,630
linux version because if you do the same

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,200
software and you provide it for free as

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:30,920
in beer and linux and on windows and

00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,110
then in schools or do you purge the

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,590
teachers or the administration's to make

00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:39,200
the effort to use linux if they can get

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,140
everything at the same level on windows

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,030
so the idea was to say if you want to

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,850
stay in windows because it's easier for

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:50,030
you it's ok but for me it's more complex

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:53,420
to maintain and packages software for

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:57,710
windows so you will have to pay for it

00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,689
and it swirled working so little bit it

00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,780
helps to fans of development motivates

00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:05,570
the development and also increase the

00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,500
audience because in some places just

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,980
being solved it opens new door to the

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,540
to your software that's strange but

00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,090
people some people or some places they

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,550
like to play software and if you don't

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:24,040
say the software they don't use it

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:26,020
that's strange so the software started

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,220
in two thousand so it's getting a little

00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:33,940
bit bored and started in gtk and the

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,650
idea was to bring the software to new

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:41,170
devices that people are using like

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:43,989
especially tablets so last year we

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:48,970
decided to rewrite everything and to do

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:52,090
it in a in qml we reuse on these the

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,500
graphics the data set or the activity is

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,630
the logic of the activities the

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,690
algorithm but of course we don't reduce

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:03,850
any code which was in see my son and now

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:06,090
we are in c++ and qml and JavaScript so

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:10,959
it's really there is really no nothing

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:13,480
common so my your fault and we took a

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,170
lot of requirements in the loop and say

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:21,390
like saying it can run in landscape or

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:26,140
portrait mode which is quite unusual for

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:28,230
four games on on tablets it makes things

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:34,480
a little bit more complex to develop but

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:36,670
we wanted to make it well take the time

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,470
to do it well and it's easier to say

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,739
okay all the screens will be the size

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,680
but so doing this is more compact but in

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:48,790
the long run we expect it to be more a

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,799
very very good feature the completion

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,200
chain isn't seeming so it's easy to

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:58,450
develop it we develop it like a regular

00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:02,500
cute application the architecture of the

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:05,560
software we have a c++ code in which is

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:10,989
in slc call or sexual activities or a

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,090
specific specific folder they are they

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,670
are

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,609
in RCC files which is all loaded at

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:20,130
runtime by the bicycle so the design of

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:23,190
the software is quite modularity see to

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,940
extend because we we only distribute if

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:29,910
you look at the zoo bandar once you

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:34,800
create a band or without the binary the

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:39,240
executable one RCC / activity and one

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:43,650
sec / translation and Jake improving the

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:49,320
runner or all of this at runtime so it's

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:52,380
very clean at the distribution level to

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,660
create a new activity if you want to to

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,690
collaborate on this there is a little

00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,580
script you create your view right you

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,380
will run see Meg you start to come pre

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,380
and you will have just your activity

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,950
which is a displayed and you can just

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,289
start and all you have to do is to to

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,940
change some qml fives and they did some

00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:15,870
KML file so you have to do pml-n

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:20,160
JavaScript if you need more more code

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:25,700
than the KML can can support that's very

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:29,099
easy to create an activity in you know

00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:35,910
porting I found out that a typical

00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:40,169
activity in cute qml because JavaScript

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:43,680
takes off the size in line of code than

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:47,789
what we did in Python in the old version

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,729
and we have more features more fancy

00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:54,389
graphics animations and so on so the

00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:58,320
code is really clean smaller easier to

00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:59,139
maintain it's very big big success of

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:06,599
technology

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:11,830
is very good status we brought hit the

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:16,419
100 activities on the 140 of the gtk

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:19,199
version we we have we got 60

00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,789
contributors currently we have 22

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:27,129
student working on Angie complete part

00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:29,759
of KD Summer of Code we need to rework

00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:33,069
of the graphics some of you maybe have

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,629
LP does get some fun and to pay to pay

00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:39,900
timilty working on the on the redesign

00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:44,229
of algae complete to make something more

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,969
more logic in terms of graphics so it's

00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,279
a great success also that we've been

00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:51,669
able to get some france to other team OT

00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:54,009
working more solid mounts on Angie

00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:58,120
complete to reduce graphism that's very

00:06:54,009 --> 00:07:01,300
good very good Android release in

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,500
january 2005 so it's really it's really

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:09,129
new so we are the nose in aus content to

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:12,009
to make an android version so that was

00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:15,789
the first release of GECOM player in the

00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:20,169
white and we'll see how it works in

00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:21,460
terms of distribution 16 languages for

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:25,180
the last version at one hundred percent

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,430
thanks to KD translation team we have

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:31,659
reused or the content of the observed

00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:39,599
version to avoid duplicating effort when

00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:39,599
we when it was possible multi-platform

00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:46,149
so what we found doings as doing g

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,139
comprehend doing the sport QT is very

00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:53,649
very well in doing doing multiple for me

00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:55,480
we have very few specific code just to

00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:57,610
enter the

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,250
distribution the packaging where we have

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:05,590
to find the where are located there were

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:09,070
RCC files that's almost all the if that

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:19,420
we have in our code so it's cute is

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:21,430
really holding it it's it's doing what

00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,620
it said it it does in doing a very very

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:31,030
an excellent job in there doing a bit

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:35,380
apart from under our environment what we

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:38,590
have to do some approaches which here

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:41,710
there are some some specific stuff to do

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,080
too but here we are dipping we're going

00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:47,950
deeper in the in the integration of the

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,920
different mobile platform and it

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:56,650
requires still achieve some work in

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:59,560
terms of packaging it's a it's a lot of

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:01,570
work even if a if QT is very good to do

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,480
so to the software you can really fast

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,640
get to get g computer run on iOS but

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,180
then when you want to bundle it to

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,980
package it to to go to be able to upload

00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:18,400
it on the store it's it's where the work

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:25,330
is where the most of work is do is to

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:27,540
read so of course we want to object

00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,190
completely undone as many platform as we

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:37,240
as it could as a as people are using but

00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:39,880
it's quite how to do because if you

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,100
don't have the other where you are out

00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:47,370
of luck maybe some contributors will

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:49,690
package it but if you really want to

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,550
turn to

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,950
the thoughts are going and to be like

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,470
professional you need to to be able to

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,140
provide the new binary as soon as there

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:03,220
is annuities so it's hard to just count

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,380
off on the community of someone as yahoo

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,780
at time but six months later perhaps

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,810
railway is broken and you have nobody to

00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:13,420
make the package anymore and you left or

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:16,180
the users of this platform in the in the

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:19,360
dark and they cannot use a software

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,630
anymore so it's it's quite complex you

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,610
you really want to go professional we

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,820
need to have the outward at some point

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,340
if you want to support a platform so

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,130
going should look at upper it's quite

00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:37,240
expensive to buy order or the gadget you

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:40,090
need to to develop and test on an upper

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,830
platform so you need to learn and

00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,590
integrate the two chain on that / you

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,840
need to use xcode you even if you did a

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,730
lot of a lot to to integrate and to

00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,040
avoid using the specific tools of each

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:54,400
platform at some point you have to use

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,440
them and they cannot do or everything

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,740
for you it does a lot that not

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,520
everything and then there are a lot of

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,710
work to maintain the your product in the

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,290
App Store so it's more like a marketing

00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,970
but well we are doing everything so we

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,480
are doing the marketing the communities

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:16,270
so it's a lot of work to create create

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,490
product and trees in the stores to

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:23,230
maintain them to have the product being

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:26,470
accepted you have to follow up the

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,840
remarks of the customers or users of the

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,980
application we say this is not working I

00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,780
want this I want that so you have to

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,790
make some community around your product

00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:40,660
to make sure it's it's available is

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:47,589
working and it takes her it takes time

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:51,760
to do this and promotion it's all to

00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:55,030
find y de compra is not number one I am

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,590
down the right on this tour yeah android

00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,140
store because it's where we have it for

00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,030
now I don't know why it's not number one

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,740
they are before you comprehend the store

00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,770
they are applications that are for sure

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,710
not as good as G complete even if we are

00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,780
not perfect that they are product say

00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,510
why they are before us I I test the

00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,790
application see it's just crazy it

00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:19,900
should be better but why I there before

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:25,600
us I don't know so I found out at some

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:28,690
time that for example I I I did I used

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,410
in the teacher of the application I used

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,030
g complication or software but there's a

00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:39,160
teacher of an application and generate

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:42,640
store I found out the main referencing

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:46,840
in the main index for for for the store

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,520
so G compy is not something that people

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,260
are looking for if they are looking for

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,080
it it's in the description and the

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:56,520
product will welcome but if they are

00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:59,380
looking for children or educational or

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,000
if you don't have it in the teacher of

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,120
your application you will not be

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,820
proposed so I remove the chicken from

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,220
the teacher of the application so the

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,950
application is educational software or

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,990
educational for children or I don't know

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:17,230
something like everybody used because

00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:20,160
that you cannot use just names that

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,160
people don't know

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:34,260
y becomes where becomes complex at the

00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:40,920
all part of the of the of the

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:43,920
development cute is perfect but they are

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,490
birds and they are a lot of breath and

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:52,170
all different on each platform of course

00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:56,300
they are a little even if it's it's

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:59,280
perfect at 99 dot nine percent and this

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,100
got one percent are very very annoying

00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,290
because it may be a reason not to cheat

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,470
your software or it may be a reason that

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:14,940
makes yourself to a crush on some

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:17,970
platform and it's very odd to you cannot

00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,340
escape this so for example on Android we

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,220
had we made some particles which was

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:26,490
very fancy it works well but on some

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,070
devices it crashes so we removed the

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:32,460
particles for everybody because we

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:40,830
cannot know which devices makes it crash

00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:42,560
and why we cannot find it on windows we

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:46,560
could not find a suitable audio codec

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:50,100
because we we are using OGG Vorbis a

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,310
native of yo codec because it's free

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:56,460
software under the best for us but on

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,650
aptor you cannot use our homies on us

00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,130
you cannot use of bobby's you have to

00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:05,090
use AAC so we had to make to change a

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:08,070
complete to be able to work on AAC or

00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:10,860
hobbies or everything is customizable at

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:14,880
completion time so we can use the codec

00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:18,180
or another but on Windows we still don't

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,980
know what to use except mp3 but mp3 you

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,320
have to pay royalties to distribute an

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,750
application that include ambitious and

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:30,750
we are not yet ready to play

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:36,360
a four for this right so on Windows we

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:41,400
are we have no signs for now on mac OS

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:44,400
six packaging a cutie cute aves if you

00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,740
tap apps is broken when you try to you

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,510
can make a package and distribute it out

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,470
of the store but when you want to upload

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:55,620
it on the store apple says your

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:59,880
application is not it's not okay because

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:03,690
there is a cute library that as an

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:08,940
underscore in it and say you're logged

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:12,630
and iOS we have an SVG wondering that is

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,990
dub dub lid on retina display we have a

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:20,070
we have demo downstair on the the

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:24,030
chicken Priebus you can see it so we did

00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:31,760
open father's we need open bags on and

00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:31,760
cute by tracker but no solution for this

00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:39,900
iOS are so requires a commercial cuter

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:46,339
conversion to be able to render and

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:54,080
distribute an application for iOS this

00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:57,960
zest cause 30 euros per amounts that

00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,570
recently the DJ said that this version

00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,300
was not selling very well so that's this

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:07,439
was kind of indie developer and it was

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:10,050
not was for them to continues as this

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,630
product line and they say they will

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:17,939
discontinue it and so developers would

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:22,319
have to pay 350 gyros turns to to do

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:26,130
this which is logically that natural

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:29,580
possible to pay its too much 4g complete

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:32,250
so i paid the sub 0 so is a the change

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,900
the zester they say to you you have up

00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:38,030
to

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:40,010
last of August they still accept people

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:45,520
to join the program at sochi europe or

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:54,110
not but you can see it's like it's very

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:58,160
complex to to get there we are so we're

00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:01,490
sort of contributors who try to go to

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,100
look at other platforms like selfish we

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:08,390
looked at the human to mobile platform

00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:13,670
we looked at Jorah and on each of this

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:18,440
platform it's it's have any cuties there

00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:22,850
even if we you can really fast RG config

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,980
raining raining on it if you want to

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:28,970
package it and to make a product and to

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:30,470
make it clean and to not use could use

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,070
the correct version of queues or

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:36,410
something it's always always a little

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:39,530
bit complex and especially when we not

00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:41,570
have yard where we will have to bio each

00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:45,250
of this hardware to be able to maintain

00:18:41,570 --> 00:19:00,230
it like i said it's kind of complex two

00:18:45,250 --> 00:19:03,110
together commercial approach i started

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,660
this in 2003 like i said on the at frost

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:08,780
on windows so i sell binaries and

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:12,350
proprietary platforms the demo version

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:14,870
is is always available with all the

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,240
contributed activities or i am doing is

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:20,090
that if people contribute activities to

00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:25,130
g complete they are in the demo version

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:29,450
so everybody as they all the activities

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:33,500
that i do myself I make them as they

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,510
require a fee but it's very easy to get

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,000
to access to everything on windows there

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,400
is echo

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,510
which is saying that access to the full

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,250
version for Android the AP car is easy

00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,350
to find Angie computer net right

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:52,230
download if you just browse the files

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:56,910
you get to Z 2 Z ATK so when I do really

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:59,820
this on the add one ounce mount that in

00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:02,160
the community I give the links so people

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,710
can contribute and will participate in

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,290
the community they get the software for

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,200
free they can do whatever they want take

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,730
them there is no limitation treaty so

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,880
many people will get it from the stores

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:18,120
for Android or from a computer net for

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:26,100
windows or mac OSX they are required to

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:28,470
baton so it's very very interesting how

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,690
it works they are sorta downloads per

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,730
day OMG computed net for the for the

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:38,840
windows version which is just the gtk

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:44,940
version they are about 26 per day and

00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:47,580
30s cool says in 2004 in what I require

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:51,320
for schools they I sell about something

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:54,150
like 50 euros for school so scusa

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,610
contact me they say i want g compete for

00:20:54,150 --> 00:21:04,080
all the school and I make them a

00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:08,160
quotation and they pay it and so on

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:13,200
droid there is about 100 installation

00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:18,200
prob day so we are 20,000 so far but

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:23,220
there are 15 the installation per day ok

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:29,310
100 is good 50 less interesting what

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:31,800
happened is that the Google store they

00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:34,740
take out an application as being

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:37,530
installed if somebody keeps the

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,420
application more than today so if you

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,850
just download an application from the

00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,460
store and you uninstall it it will not

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,430
become

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:53,080
as an installation so it means that

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:57,940
people are decent studying to complete

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:59,950
some people are keeping it some people

00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,750
don't like the application maybe doesn't

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,770
work on the platform maybe it is not

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:09,610
what they expected I don't know the

00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:12,940
rating is quite good for that certified

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,980
so there is a rating on five there is

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,590
about to sales per day which is about

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:21,220
the same number of say that what what

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:25,300
what I have under on Windows but in

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:28,690
Windows I said it nine euros Android I

00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:33,070
said it six year old but uh not worried

00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:38,610
Google takes thirty percent and there is

00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:42,730
a vat of thirty percent or so or 20,000

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:51,850
so on 60 rolls you get three euros got

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:53,950
five which is quite less some number

00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:59,770
assets yeah it's very popular in France

00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:05,380
I don't know why don't Lee because of

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:10,900
the name yeah or perhaps because I'm

00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:13,330
French and I do better marketing in

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,630
French in French of French sides or

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:19,450
whatever I don't know we do everything

00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,760
in English so it should be as popular in

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:25,330
or all the countries that is it which is

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,250
in France but it's not maybe a cultural

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:31,630
PK we could maybe there are some

00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:33,850
cultural effects that I put in the

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:38,920
software that makes it a softer more

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:41,800
friendship more the popularity is

00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,460
growing in other countries very popular

00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,660
in which

00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:48,970
in the Brazilian Spain and Rochelle many

00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,910
many countries or this is growing so

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:59,110
that's quite good to see the software

00:23:51,910 --> 00:24:06,850
are moving moving on like this app store

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:11,320
ranking that's what doing Google on just

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:13,690
toys that they they they stopped the

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,600
ranking at 500 so if you were less than

00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,130
500 you don't know what you are you

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,710
don't know where where you are ranking

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:24,280
so they are looking at by countries they

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:26,970
have stores for each country and you can

00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,970
see where you are

00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:40,800
so it's a lot of work when you we

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:44,160
started doing everything again in a last

00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,820
year we we were looking for about two

00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,560
years of work to complete support not

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,690
sure we will achieve this at the end of

00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,300
the year perhaps we will have completed

00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,760
the port maybe not but we are getting

00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:02,160
closer and the project is very dynamic

00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:04,410
and active and we are really willing to

00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,810
kill the gtk Vijender vinegar because

00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:09,150
the gtk version is to maintain their new

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:12,390
version of the gtk version on a regular

00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:15,210
basis when we have berry bros i continue

00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:17,280
to package it and maintain it so i will

00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:21,960
have to just kill it and doing this

00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,700
conversion to be better what we are

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,260
looking at we are something like this

00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,290
and the jetta conversion is a teacher

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:31,950
console so that the software can be

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:36,330
really using a inner teacher environment

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:39,450
and especially with tablets where the

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:41,490
teacher have to be able to let's say we

00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:44,640
are we are in a classroom with children

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,620
and you have tablets and it's all for

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,350
the teacher to know is the children are

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,660
doing the exercise or not and we really

00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:54,480
have to provide some things so that the

00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,340
teacher can just control little bit

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,700
words what the children are doing on the

00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,700
targets

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:12,450
we need you that's a community is very

00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:17,100
important for us because if we don't

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:19,920
have any marketing or marketing team or

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:23,040
anything so if if you talk about you

00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:27,990
complete about your community to choose

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,630
new site about about about linux in your

00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:33,480
own in your country that's very very

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:36,360
important for us to to give us some

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,670
visibility and so that people find you

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:43,170
completely tested fine if it's useful

00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:47,010
for us for for them what's also

00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:49,050
important is to ask the voices we want

00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,760
we really want to complete working as

00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:54,179
many languages as possible there is a

00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:58,200
lot of default to support language even

00:26:54,179 --> 00:27:00,480
minerally languages that are in small

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,240
group where they want to keep alive a

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,670
language j'ai compris very good tool for

00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,030
them because that's a quality software

00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:12,050
they can translate it and I can't put

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:16,350
the voices on it so we have everything

00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:18,450
in place to to accept a contribution in

00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,840
terms of translation of course but in

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:25,130
terms of our voices and thus we can add

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:29,610
a new website a new page to have a

00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:33,530
summary of all the voices translation in

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:37,140
which country now we can know where

00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:40,050
what's missing what voices Miss is

00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:45,450
missing four in each country if you want

00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:48,420
to meet I provide for everybody we want

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,490
to contribute to voices I can send you

00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,860
and I offers a week like a

00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,260
semi-professional Mick so that you can

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:58,260
get the mic at all and make the voices

00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:01,620
when you want and continue to provide

00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,120
updates and if you want to make adjust

00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:13,650
by you and I

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:18,530
I off all week for me I mean me there is

00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:23,550
no Armenia currently there is one in in

00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:26,880
England there is one in France for the

00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:44,910
German voices and there is one in Brazil

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:49,520
so I'm done tough questions you can show

00:28:44,910 --> 00:29:01,290
you now because it's not my computer

00:28:49,520 --> 00:29:05,630
licensed massage I just but I checked

00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:09,050
this out score and a sonic you still

00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:11,700
dating were together which washed out

00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:16,590
where is the moving to think you know

00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:20,820
know that I didn't talk about it but j

00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:23,490
comp is now part of KDE this year it has

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,429
been accepted in an extra year so we are

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:30,450
no more in KD review so we are in extra

00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:32,550
Jessa official repository is KD so if

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:37,350
you go on Jay completed net developer us

00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:41,400
and you search for the get it will be KD

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:44,370
1 but we are maintaining a mural on kita

00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:48,090
so that some contributors can just for

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:54,950
the project easily and provide food

00:29:48,090 --> 00:30:03,150
requests I'm good where you can move

00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:06,840
Kundalini get cleaning yeah yeah Katie

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:10,340
because while musty people will just

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:14,220
make a small contribution get up is fine

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:16,860
but if we want it is possible to make

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:21,179
regular contributions then they will be

00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:23,280
integrated by us in the KDE process but

00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:25,890
for small just one shot contribution

00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,809
it's just not very interesting to make

00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,659
this person if she's not interested to

00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:34,140
to participate in the KD community it's

00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:50,070
not works to make the effort but the

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:54,659
idea so you will want the first project

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:57,659
you later in weight against men

00:30:54,659 --> 00:31:08,580
physically nothing to you which expected

00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:12,350
you just beat algeria it was present

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:16,020
experience I nothing bad to say about

00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:19,559
about it i find it natural and straight

00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:25,080
forward i have no no problem the program

00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:27,270
with this got some help with the time I

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,110
needed air but I could find somebody to

00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:34,940
to to help me moving forward so it was

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,940
just no problem

00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:44,500
