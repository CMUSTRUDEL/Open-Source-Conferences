Title: Aleix Pol Gonzalez - Going Cross Platform: Are We Compromising? - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	I would like to go through some of the issues I've found on some projects I've been working when it came to portability to other platforms and form factors, so we can put these problems in common, see them coming and come up with a general way to react to them.

Do KDE Frameworks dependencies help? Should I port the application to QML? What platforms can we take into account?

I'll try to infer answers from the discussions we've had for KDevelop, KDE Edu and KDE Connect.

	00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:30,380
alright so yeah it's like the third time

00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:31,850
I talk about Chris plus for me stuff at

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,210
the academy you're probably already

00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:37,309
tired of this but I think it's something

00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,350
very important so I don't have a problem

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,220
with being very very stubborn I'm

00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,159
stubborn on other aspects of my life so

00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:48,110
with those at academy it's also good

00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,809
first of all up online I mallesh like I

00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:53,540
said and what i want to emphasize here

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:57,260
is that i've been working for the most

00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:59,960
of the of my k/d time on applications

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,479
what does that mean while we've you've

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,750
all heard it is not the desktop anymore

00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:10,000
and it's all about all kind of different

00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:13,729
projects and even if when i joined fiddy

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,649
it was a desktop i was already working

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:18,820
on applications my first application i

00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:22,579
worked on in ink ed was k algebra and

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:25,640
shortly followed by K develop which well

00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:29,119
arguably have maybe nothing that much to

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,179
do with plasma but then one of the

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,490
biggest reasons why I hacked on Katie

00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:38,090
was probably because I was already using

00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,520
cute at that time and one of the reasons

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,829
i use cute was the documentation the

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:47,240
second one though was that I was not

00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:50,179
tying myself into a platform I remember

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,850
actually when I was teenager reading

00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:55,249
documentation but then I actually used

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:59,719
windows I had this feeling every time I

00:01:55,249 --> 00:02:01,999
read one of those books that learning

00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:04,100
that would make me be only their right

00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:10,030
and what they wanted to do is to create

00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:10,030
stuff that well as every want to use so

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:18,140
why I keep talking about cross-platform

00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:23,060
an about being able to be on other place

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:26,690
and for me the reason is that I don't

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:30,530
want all of our projects to be focusing

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,840
a niche or focusing just a subset of

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:38,000
society when I when I create my software

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,250
i created with a bigger mindset and

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,080
actually I don't want that the

00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,200
technology were using or the platform we

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,989
were using is is the limiting factor on

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,660
who's going to be able to enjoy it and I

00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:52,220
completely will agree that free software

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,830
platforms will be better for everyone

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,670
and we should tell everyone to use them

00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:05,810
but then I still won't improve society

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:08,540
without waving a flag so anyway I think

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,459
that the first and most important point

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,000
is through to reach the light reduce

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:16,160
waste to read this to reach society

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,250
nowadays we don't I don't think we would

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,680
consider that the people who use

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:26,090
computers or who used technology this

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:29,209
kind of technology as in IT are a subset

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:31,400
of society nowadays I would consider

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,970
that everyone is using them and and we

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,010
need to go to them and say well we are

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,560
some nice people who make free software

00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:44,780
and we make it for you and and we're

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:49,940
here to help you another very important

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:52,940
reason is that we want to take we want

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:56,120
to make somewhere that is part of our

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,579
life altogether that is not only part of

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,190
what we're doing when we're in front of

00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:03,650
a computer all the women serve has

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,930
already showed that there is that we're

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,739
working at the systems on this device

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:15,430
that we will be able to carry around but

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:18,220
then but then first of all currently you

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,389
what you get the device is much easier

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:25,800
that is not using Katie then then

00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:28,590
is right and reducing all the use cases

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,469
to what whatever plasma for Indians

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:34,529
would be reducing our or scope and our

00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:39,960
mindset a lot and in a very not needed

00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:41,909
way but on the other hand here we're

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,889
talking about creating technology work

00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:49,379
with talking about about creating

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:53,699
software that that can have an impact on

00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:55,319
many aspects of our lives and but most

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,810
of you over here will have an android

00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:01,080
phone will have an iOS phone well you

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,180
will have a blackberry phone so I think

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,150
it's a very legitimate use case still

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:11,580
for a free software community like we

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:13,409
are so what do I mean when I talk

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,349
cross-platform there's probably many

00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:18,689
different definitions and I maybe I'm

00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:21,270
not using the correct semantics even but

00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:25,529
what do I mean well there's very two

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:27,900
very important axis in the in the

00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:29,729
concept as I see it there's on one hand

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:35,279
for on the form factor you can be

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:38,370
talking about a TV and you can be

00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,649
talking about a phone or a desktop and

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,750
the other axis would be clearly the

00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:48,089
platform operating system the technology

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:49,830
and actually most of the of the of the

00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,300
of the technologies of the operating

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,210
systems will have different form factors

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,189
and vice versa and actually in KDE even

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:59,909
we are covering already a lot of them

00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:03,389
and even if when we talk about making

00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:07,770
software that is targeting the many form

00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:10,500
factors that plasma support even we can

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,120
do it we still have the problem that we

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,360
need to adapt to each one of them right

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,129
so in the end we we have a huge problem

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:23,009
with ton of variables which ranges from

00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:24,050
white compilers to use while new

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:30,179
Campfield

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:35,039
rules at to adapt to or even yeah the

00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:36,719
firm factory so since I am now no guru I

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,539
will talk about my experience a little

00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:41,819
bit and i will start talking about k

00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:46,919
algebra because we will know that i love

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:49,349
the project and yeah it's my my my in a

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,349
big project to move anything which is

00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:54,830
Katie related into a platform because

00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:57,889
basically it doesn't rely on too many

00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:01,080
operating system dependent features and

00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:04,439
and it still has a library and an

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:12,089
application so you get to play around as

00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:14,219
if it's a standard KD project so I think

00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:16,919
that the most important part when we

00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:20,159
talk about nowadays operating systems

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:25,409
especially mobile but nowadays not even

00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:28,079
really is to get our platform or or or

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:30,240
software Ananda on whatever the users

00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:35,099
are going to reach out to the to the

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,339
server and in the 90s or even in the

00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,050
2000s the way to install stuff

00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,860
especially on windows which is what

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:46,740
people use back then was to download the

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:49,469
Installer kind of thing and from whoever

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,999
it was with all of the viruses and

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:54,569
everything and getting it in your

00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:57,179
computer on linux on the other hand we

00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:59,819
were probably a bit smarter we protein

00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:02,189
good leverage on some assumptions but on

00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,800
the other hand we had the distributions

00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:06,479
that already allowed us to have a

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,589
library and to do those stuff and

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,769
actually it's what we've been doing so

00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:15,449
far on linux we have never really

00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:16,800
distributed any binaries what we've been

00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:20,550
doing is just relying on the

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,499
distributions and NIH has worked but we

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,349
know how it has worked it has work it's

00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:28,289
going to be well but better in any case

00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:30,779
on linux patterns with bin where the

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:30,940
users reached out to on on the rest of

00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:37,060
the

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:38,979
we haven't and and more and more the

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,530
devices are starting to be more narrow

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,150
for example if you go to many of the

00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,590
operating systems the modern operating

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,250
systems and you try to download

00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,940
something from the from the interwebs

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,680
that thing that you're downloading

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,810
wouldn't won't be able to be installed

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,290
on on the on the computer right or it

00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:01,570
will warn saying this is coming from

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:02,860
from virus land so what we need to we

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:08,280
need to be there we need to be where

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:11,230
people are expecting us to go and and I

00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,900
don't think that we start to think about

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,760
them is well I have this application

00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,370
that is working on on Leonard generally

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,530
because it's what we're using I need to

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,660
put it to this platform and then you

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:24,700
start realizing that some issues some

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,210
differences will arise some of them will

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:32,350
be technical exclusively like where do I

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:36,580
look for the main that qml file where do

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,670
I do for my images gift abstract some of

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:42,240
these issues doesn't obstruct others and

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:48,670
there's many hats that we could use to

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:52,080
solve them what my suggesting here is to

00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:55,770
always try to have one one code base

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,080
because it's what I feel that will have

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:04,240
the most maintainability in in the long

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:06,840
run and actually not be too strict there

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,240
I haven't managed actually to do that

00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:13,570
even on Android at the moment and inkay

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,860
algebra which should be trivial it is

00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:21,160
not I have some if devs for for Android

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,620
and I'd say it's fine i can actually i

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,320
think that it's very interesting and at

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,839
this point that we start to think about

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,540
how should have have it be so that I

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,550
didn't have had this problem so we can

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,710
start moving this and trying to solve

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:39,040
these issues upstream whether it's in

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,750
scenic or or in cute because most of

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,550
these issues

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,440
will happen on other projects and this

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,640
is especially interesting because this

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,280
way we don't become that project that

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,730
could get to Android but we are creating

00:10:50,280 --> 00:11:02,520
the kini that will go to Android or that

00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:05,070
will go to ubuntu phone right and then

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,860
there's the UI DUI it's something that

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,340
one would assume that it should be maybe

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,290
probably the same on every platform the

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:17,820
truth is that at the moment it's quite

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:19,830
impossible to do to get that should try

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,960
to come up with a kiss p controls that

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,910
integrated on the look and feel of the

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,150
different platforms and actually it kind

00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,590
of works nowadays even on on Android

00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:33,300
they have a huge heart that makes

00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:35,370
applications look native and and since

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,980
the pitch card they are also moving away

00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:41,820
from it which its kind of understandable

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,070
but then in any case you also need to

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,810
cut it to the different form factors and

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:51,200
it's not something that you can make you

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:55,140
can't generalize so Indian you need to

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,510
create a specific you is or that's what

00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,550
I've done at least four for the

00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,950
different platforms and then it's

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,750
actually quite recommended or I would

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,260
recommend to have different ones for the

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,780
different form factors because otherwise

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:12,930
things that would look good on a small

00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:18,450
screen look like to mumbles on on the

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:20,130
bigger one then another example I would

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:23,150
like to talk about this KD connect I

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,110
started working on it mostly this year

00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,310
because I think it's a really cool

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,240
project and I

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:33,060
wanted to experiment a little bit and of

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,920
course they're the set of problems I

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,510
found where we're actually quite

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,950
different first of all Katie connect is

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,320
nowadays only working on two platforms

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:48,450
it's working on Android and it's working

00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:50,640
on let's call it KD I don't under it it

00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:53,220
is using the Android SDK so it's in SAP

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:57,240
application and it's actually something

00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:00,240
quite a novelty from for kitty it's not

00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,880
the only application that has decided to

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,440
go into another another platform and say

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,710
well i'm going to use whatever its

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,950
suffering in order to integrate with KDE

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:15,270
and i'll order to to make a common

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:17,550
platform but it's still trying to it's

00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,710
still actually leveraging the other

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,540
platform rather than our technologies

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:26,120
and of course it has its own set of

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,870
problems right for example each each

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,380
person who wants to implement the

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,750
feature like let's say let's well an

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,150
example was the remote keyboard or touch

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:38,930
pad line it had to be implemented on KDA

00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:42,089
first and then android or vice versa and

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,770
it had to land on both sides at the same

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:48,330
time so that it could be used otherwise

00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:50,910
it was like useless and and this is a

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,370
this is a problem in it if you only have

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:59,760
one one codebase you have only one set

00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:04,950
up problem of bugs etc etc the other

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:08,130
plum that Katie connect us as well is

00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,680
that the boss is cross-platform ish so

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,459
one thing we could say is well let's use

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:19,100
the same code base for example or maybe

00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:21,990
big chunk of of what Katie connect is on

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:26,580
the KDE connect kitty is one Android and

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:29,940
then add an Android SDK kind of UI on

00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,250
top this could be perfectly feasible but

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,200
then we need to start removing this kind

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,840
of technology that we're using and we

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:40,560
you there or actually not really sure if

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,360
it's kind of work here that maybe i'm

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,720
not sure but in any case there's this

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,280
things like for example KDE connect has

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,280
to be poor certain other different

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,080
desktops as well at some point grant and

00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,470
when we considered at OS and windows we

00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,110
thought the bosses probably acceptable

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,400
also nobody really knows and there's no

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,630
but they're really pushing for those

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,790
platforms so it's kind of hard to tell

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:09,690
and that's actually it with the point

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:12,810
right if you have few people especially

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,030
on the nonlinear scaly platforms you

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,050
especially on those cases what you want

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:20,790
to have people that are on top on

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:25,010
android we could because albert is the

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:29,580
maintainer the the android sdk

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:30,840
implementation and and so on but then on

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,960
the other platforms who want to have

00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:38,690
even less of a deep divergence than done

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:42,270
on on on lyrics actually we had a desert

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,920
last year for iOS and it was kind of

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,730
reading was doing the things it should

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,440
have done and the reason it wasn't

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:53,610
uploaded to the apple store so people

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,620
could use it was that why would the guy

00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,630
was not that very responsive and we

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,470
didn't feel that comfortable with

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:05,280
maintaining the old Bessie was he came

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:08,280
up with because none of us are have iOS

00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,460
devices none of us have the experience

00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:15,360
therefore it was a bit of a suicide

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:17,430
maybe so in that case also if we had

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,220
used the same codebase were used to and

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:28,130
we only had to worry about the UI maybe

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:28,130
maybe it would have made sense so

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,240
we're still talking about what i was

00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,160
saying for in pushing the depth by the

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,550
pushing the dependencies up and down

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,310
what i mean is let's try to leave some

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,920
kind of safe space when whenever

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,440
possible that you can say this is going

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,720
to work on any platform or this is going

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,170
to work on the set of platforms that we

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,690
want to support so whenever the guy who

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,240
is very interested in yola phones for

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,550
example we can tell him you can try this

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,780
code base and you are not going to die

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:09,280
in the in the in the attempt because

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:12,860
otherwise they already feel quite

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,230
unsecured about developing actually

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,510
those platforms nobody really knows how

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,990
they work and the people who approached

00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:24,829
you they probably usually just want the

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:28,520
application more or less working and and

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:33,740
what we did there was through a lot of

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:37,100
possibility to for example strip coyote

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:41,210
dependencies and NK service which put a

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,760
lot of stuff because it was it's already

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,500
in a lot of work to ask them to compile

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,150
it and to package it for the platform if

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,130
you have to ask them to package all of

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,410
Katy frameworks to get onto that

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:58,490
platform how we did that actually was

00:17:51,410 --> 00:18:01,730
that at the moment we can have use que

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:05,530
cayó network configuration or use the

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,970
cutes version so if you don't want the

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:11,960
Kyoto dependency for example you can

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:14,390
just use cute and then it will only work

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,360
for file and HDD and a couple of stuff

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,820
and if you use the the Cal one it will

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:25,300
use all of the platform all of the

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,300
protocols which is kind of cool then

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:33,440
when we talk about this what you're

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,830
talking about is something I call to

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,730
myself the control and integration

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:41,240
compromise which is

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:44,060
never you want to control more how

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,440
something works like let's say integrate

00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,950
better with how the colonel works

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,050
internet integrate better with what the

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,120
with what the application looked like

00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:55,550
you're losing integration automatically

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,320
because the platform might do the same

00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,720
that you're doing or might it might do

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,930
something very different for example you

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,210
might decide that in P developed you

00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:09,020
want the menu some on the bottom and you

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,300
want the toolbars on the left and your

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,370
application will weird on every platform

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,610
because of other platform is doing that

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:19,630
and it's actually the kind of things you

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:22,700
probably want to decide at some point

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:25,910
and then also I wanted to add a couple

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:28,090
of slides with my experience with

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:31,850
platform which is admittedly not that

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,460
big but in general the thing to take

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,140
into account there is that mostly things

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,730
just work over there because it's

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,190
actually the same operating system we're

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,490
already using it or at least the same

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:45,650
stock except for Weiland so if things

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:49,940
don't work is mostly marketing dresses

00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:51,230
error and and when it works its thanks

00:19:49,940 --> 00:20:00,380
to you because you did such an amazing

00:19:51,230 --> 00:20:02,570
job but in any case in any case but what

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,580
usually happens is that you get you have

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,820
an application that sits maybe and

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,230
that's not the kitchen it's called one

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,730
it was looking properly not a desktop

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,930
you put it over there it looks like

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,910
Frankenstein camping and well then you

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,520
have to work on doing the specific UI

00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:25,520
for for the phone which actually this in

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:27,620
this case it can be either moving making

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,320
the small components adaptable into the

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:34,940
form factor or it could be doing the

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,440
whole UI altogether which is what the

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,000
hood you i hope together is what we're

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,880
doing or I was doing

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,380
algebra 1 without doing nowadays and it

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,270
could change because it's not final yet

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,730
but what I'm doing nowadays is making

00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:48,760
the components to understand that it's

00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:52,550
on a small screen so it needs to

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:57,250
position a bit differently but only on a

00:20:52,550 --> 00:21:03,830
per component ladies so as conclusions I

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:06,260
want to remind a little bit that what we

00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:10,070
want is to make when we design an

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,810
application we can design it into moving

00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:15,470
on other platforms at some point in life

00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:19,610
it's not a new field its software

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:22,790
engineering has been about that on since

00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:24,950
long time it's completely fine and I

00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,260
think it's very rewarding to see your

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,210
your software working on on very

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,510
different use cases or at least

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,340
definitely very different devices for me

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,770
actually was quite interesting to see

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,290
console or keep right working on the

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,240
phone it was something like is this

00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:45,950
really supposed to be working correctly

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:48,730
I think I think it's really cool but

00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:52,280
then as I we say trying to improve the

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:54,500
foundations like improving cute

00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,180
improving frameworks this goes a long

00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,640
way because you're not improving just

00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,000
your use case you're improving probably

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,250
any other use case and it will make that

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,850
the the suffering I was going through

00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,560
when i started with key algebra well i

00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,200
don't have to go through it when i'm

00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:18,230
porting other applications and so you

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:20,540
don't so you're welcome and yes

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:24,230
downsizing but I meant with this is the

00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,660
the Cayo compromised having kayo

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,940
everywhere it's really cool and actually

00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:31,280
for example on the phone we just put it

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,860
there and work and it's amazing and we

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,280
have little parties about cayo but then

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:41,120
100 it's maybe not needed and we have

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,090
mechanisms to cut it down it could be

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,809
interesting for some projects and

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,419
actually I don't think

00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:50,779
we have to be very scared of saying this

00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:52,820
cannot be done on Android because if you

00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:56,480
want to use a proper platform you would

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,559
use the plasma phone of course and then

00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,539
the new gun field which is actually

00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:01,730
something I don't have a solution for I

00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:08,240
I would love to tell you what you should

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:10,700
do things keep changing we give cute has

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,330
evolved a lot in the last three or four

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,940
years it started with q mal it's quick

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,889
it with two kids we controls and now kid

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:22,580
wit controls to which is something

00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:24,649
completely different and so it's still a

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,570
bit of a moving target this also means

00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:28,879
it's an interesting subject and I would

00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:31,639
suggest that to take a look on it and

00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:35,539
follow it and this is the did the

00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:37,100
controversial part it's it's a a hard

00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:39,559
problem and actually we were doing

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:43,669
something very different actually cute

00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:46,999
used to be about code once run anywhere

00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:48,950
and and the corollary would be and it

00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:52,249
would look integrated with the platform

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:54,679
and actually with the last developments

00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:56,690
in Kiama and actually even since the

00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:00,230
start of pml things haven't been

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:03,440
integrating all that properly so the

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:05,720
thought I want to put in people's minds

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,659
and actually I want to talk with the vin

00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,820
ET about is to consider whether we

00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:18,940
really want to look integrated with the

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:18,940
platform right away as a main as I mean

00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:27,100
as I mean gold for example if you think

00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:30,259
about what other people are doing or

00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:32,690
grita I was talking with linear last

00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:34,080
week he was telling me that when they

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,029
were working to

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,580
at some point I realized that this style

00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:41,870
that was running over there wasn't that

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:45,149
good and they ended up using a plastic

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,590
Tuesday which actually means not really

00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:48,990
integrating with a Luger pillow top of

00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:51,059
the platform and I understand it it's

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,399
quite fine with people I don't really

00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,500
think somebody would say I'm not gonna

00:24:53,399 --> 00:25:01,500
use critter because it the buttons are

00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:03,269
not ugly another example is google are

00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,539
using the materials design a bit of a

00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:08,789
brand now adays and i was looking at an

00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:11,039
iphone from a friend some days ago and

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:15,690
if you look at it the applications on

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,190
iOS from google are also replicating the

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,820
design decisions that they took on

00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:22,830
android so that means that integration

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,620
is good I'm not really going to change

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:28,830
that puts there's probably other ways to

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:33,480
look at it and actually this would make

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:36,799
our work probably much simpler in some

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,899
areas and it would open maybe some new

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,909
opportunities so well I would like to

00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:46,049
hear some fun your thoughts at some

00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:48,240
point and maybe now in the questions or

00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:52,909
during the week which I'm going to be

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,909
here so

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:16,539
notice the local media applications all

00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:26,110
your hard work so did extremely early

00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:43,240
but the easiest I videos and hit the

00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:49,289
customers are able to imagine the

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:55,230
platform layer style versus package

00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:55,230
express the RAM and housing there

00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:05,080
yeah I might have an opinion but it's

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,930
not worth it buddy I mean I could I from

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,660
a very developer preview I would say

00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,550
that what I want is not to be able not

00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,040
to have to think about these kind of

00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:20,800
problems at all but then it's probably

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:23,650
just me being lazy in my ideal world I

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,840
have a toolbar menu bar and it gets

00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:29,290
wherever it has to go which is how we

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,030
used to work on on kid widgets it's

00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,980
probably very good idea to that

00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:36,610
applications loop whatever they need to

00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:39,870
look like but I prefer your feet like

00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,870
better than whatever I can say

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:24,250
yeah in this regard I think that I am

00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:29,020
fine with that problem because it's

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:31,330
mostly a programmer problem I mean it's

00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,760
something i can solve because I know how

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,919
to add a mover button as long as I know

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,929
what the alternative I have if I mean

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,760
that platform or another I'm more

00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:46,950
worried on yeah I prefer that to decide

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,950
what things look like maybe I don't

00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:28,950
and these days even though they have all

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:46,230
be more sensible not in the web world

00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:46,230
everything looks different okay

00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,040
