Title: Matija Suklja - FLA: We Meet Again! - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	A gentle introduction to the Fiduciary License Agreement [FLA] and the right time to resolve all questions you have about it.

The Fiduciary License Agreement is a type of a very well balanced copyright assignement that enables KDE e.V. to manage your contribution and if needed protect you in court, while making sure that you get all the freedom you need both for your code and yourself.

After the talk (preferably in a BoF session), there will be time to answer any questions you may have about the FLA as well as gather any comments for improvements for the future version of this document.
