Title: Dan Leinir Turthra Jensen - Gemini: Form Factor Responsiveness - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Gemini is a concept in applications which allows them to switch between distinctly different experiences depending on the form factor your device is in at any particular time. See a Gemini style application in action, and see what you need to do it with your own application.

A number of years ago, a small company named Always Innovating created devices which could switch form factor at runtime. Since then, this has become popular in a number of places, but one issue is still the awkwardness of applications, which tend to work well in one particular mode, but not very well in others.

Enter Gemini, a concept in application design which allows for the construction of applications which can change their entire operational mode to fit on these devices, in which ever mode they happen to be in.

During this presentation, and based on the work done in cooperation between Intel and now unfortunately defunct KO GmbH on the Calligra office suite, during this presentation, the concept is described through presenting Calligra Gemini, and you are given an introduction into how you can do this with your own applications.

	00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,540
hanging talks where turns out where I t

00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:17,180
running a bit late so we're going to get

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:19,130
started dan is going to talk about when

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,119
we can talk about weed killer with you

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:25,660
well Gemini Gemini and it's going to

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,660
stop loving you

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:46,480
yeah so that was fun right now why I

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:54,670
showed you this video it's not on oh oh

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:57,519
yeah this is also not on okay yeah this

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,569
is also not on which is why you couldn't

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:06,549
everything in that video nevermind right

00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:08,530
the reason you saw that video and is to

00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:10,780
give you a very quick introduction to

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,440
what German are actually is so the idea

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,180
is you have these crazy new devices

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,069
which are both laptops and tablets

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:25,480
depending on how you hold them

00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:28,540
essentially now the reason that we came

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,049
up with this idea of having applications

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,700
which can switch at runtime between

00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:37,030
these two modes is obviously because of

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:40,780
those devices and it is the realization

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,930
that while going says not all apps are

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,250
created equal the sort of things you do

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,370
want to tablet and the sort of thing to

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:52,410
do in a laptop are not the same so we

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:58,349
came up with Gemini which is about

00:03:52,410 --> 00:04:02,620
creating on tablet on the laptops

00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:06,459
editing on tablets and consuming on

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:10,169
tablets so you in as well so hence the

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:15,879
type of the video create edit and view

00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:19,989
and what we originally did it for was

00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:22,360
kreta where we had an existing touch UI

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,580
and we created something which would

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,340
switch between the touch UI and the

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:32,320
desktop UI had already existed and then

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,990
because Intel had an interest in this

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,690
obviously being the sort of people who

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,130
push these devices and they asked us if

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,890
we could do the same thing for other

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,410
bits of the colibri sweet and then

00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:47,970
recreated calibra Gemini which does it

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:51,190
for calibra word sample calibra stage

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:54,730
one of the interesting things that we

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,280
did in there was mentioning IDP is that

00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:00,970
we came up with a way of ensuring that

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:04,000
things look and sensible on any tablet

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,890
screen it's not a solution that fixes

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,500
all of these problems where you have

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,210
stuff that's all the same on and then

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,710
you know you have a tablet UI that

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,240
between squeezed down and if it's on a

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,950
phone that's not what it's about what

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
it's about is to ensure that we have the

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:24,160
same UI that fixed on a 10 inch screen

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,830
up to about 15 inch screen or a 3 inch

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,460
screen up to maybe a 7 or 8 inch screen

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,620
so it reduces the workload you still

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,630
have to create these multiple user

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,770
interfaces but you can make it much

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:43,570
easier it's not directly a Gemini thing

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:46,570
but it is it feeds into the ability to

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,860
easily more easily create Gemini style

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:54,670
applications I'm not going to dig into

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:57,010
this because we are running over and you

00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:00,070
know about the technology is basically

00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:03,310
that make this make this work it's all

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,620
because we have these these wonderful

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,990
systems the stuff that makes huge tick

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:12,820
the stuff that makes all of our tady

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:15,610
software tech the most probably most

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,010
importantly the fact that cute makes it

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,010
really really difficult to not create a

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,620
layered software so in pretty much

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,520
anyone that's here that has a piece of

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:31,600
software whether user interface based on

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,670
any of the KD frameworks have a very

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,990
strict separation between user interface

00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:40,419
and a document letter which makes it

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,260
really easy to then also create a touch

00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,390
UI for

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:49,340
what we have is a desktop application or

00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:52,460
vice versa and then the Gemini idea is

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:55,100
basically just to encapsulate those to

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,250
you is in the same application and

00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:02,990
switch them at runtime that obviously

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:06,250
take some time but it's not about to put

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,080
it in a perspective once we had the

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,840
proof of concept to create a proof of

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,500
concept for it for illegal Gemini that

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,230
was was it two weeks something like that

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,450
and that was not you know javi that was

00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:25,370
actually functional prototype that i

00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:27,620
have seen started writing now the future

00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,260
we need to ported to framework five and

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,200
five we always been helping us with a

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:37,160
for a bit but that's pretty much it

00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,620
ended cooperation less but thanks thank

00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:44,450
you to them for at least helping us with

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,740
a proof of concept of it and now it's

00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,640
not just Caligula that we want to do

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,750
this with and because of that please

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,100
everybody who has an interest in this

00:07:50,750 --> 00:08:01,790
ranbir this year is all about bringing

00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:08,320
touch to ke and a also ready yet the

00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:11,180
convergence in style of gemina so yeah

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,600
that's it thank you very much if you

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,600
want to look

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,760
