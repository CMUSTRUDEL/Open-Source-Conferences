Title: Irina Rempt - Krita Artists in the Spotlight - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Krita lives by the grace of its artists. In five minutes I will show off the work of roughly two dozen of them.

Artist interviews are a popular feature of the krita.org website. They give artists the opportunity to show their work and talk about the way they use Krita. It's remarkable that so many artists, with very different backgrounds and very different work habits, all say the same thing: the Krita team cares for its users.
