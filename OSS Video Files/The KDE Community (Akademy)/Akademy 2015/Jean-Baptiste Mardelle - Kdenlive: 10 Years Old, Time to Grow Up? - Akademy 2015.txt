Title: Jean-Baptiste Mardelle - Kdenlive: 10 Years Old, Time to Grow Up? - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	The Kdenlive video editor is about 10 years old, and a lot of challenges are still ahead of us. In this presentation, I will talk about some of the weaknesses / stengths of the project. I will also discuss the results of the recent integration of KDE Applications, the reflections that came with it and what we can learn from other great KDE applications.

Some of the recent/future developments will be presented, as well and I will be happy to share ideas with you about the evolution of open source video editing in today's world.

	00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:21,360
so John pasta steak cooking all day and

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:24,180
I'm it is there the telescope molded in

00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,850
here and we are like him talking about

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,670
the challenges that we are still facing

00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,950
with your life along with that you will

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:37,260
be talking about evolution of video

00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:42,019
editing in Hobart source for support ok

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:48,360
thank you so thanks for being here I'm

00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:50,070
shrimp ok I just decide just knew a few

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,970
days ago that I could come here so it

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:57,780
was a bit short time to prepare my my

00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:00,570
talk so excuse me in advance so i will

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:05,100
first give a few explanations on how

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:10,100
kdenlive works I've been implied in this

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:12,860
project for more than 10 years now and

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:17,189
basically getting life is just a

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:21,240
graphical interface for MLT easy the MLT

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,859
frameworks the MLT fly box was mostly

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,140
developed by done lady who is very

00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:31,530
famous person in the video world of

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:36,270
Linux he for those who are old enough he

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:39,090
wrote Kino on giving rap was first tools

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:42,490
that could be used to produce be on

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,909
Linux so he's a very complete

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:49,479
a person and we are working closely this

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:53,110
museum to to dig up killing life it's

00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:56,020
closely related to MLT some of the

00:01:53,110 --> 00:02:00,399
energy modules were written specifically

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:05,710
from killing I very good communication

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:09,759
because the two projects and what I what

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,760
I like about the MLT frameworks it come

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,540
out is that it's some kind of glue

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:21,580
between all kind of multimedia projects

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:23,650
under linux using ffmpeg sucks on lots

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,610
of hazzard projects and putting them

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:30,390
together so it's not trying to rewrite

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:34,600
everything from the start like some

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,730
video a toast try to do and most of them

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:42,370
most of them fail because i think it's a

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:46,950
it's take several several years to which

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,950
a good video camera

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,269
so getting life was fun from the start

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:05,440
to the KDE based project but it's only

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:09,400
in 2011 that we started to have more

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:14,860
contacts with KD community before that I

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:18,630
I mostly work by myself without many

00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:22,780
interactions with Katie community and in

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,790
2011 that was meeting in randa so it was

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,900
the first time that I I personally met

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:32,890
some some people in port in MKE and it

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:36,370
was a great great opportunity is allowed

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:41,560
us to build a small team and to really

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:50,260
move forward and last year taking like

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:55,239
won an Academy in the world that we seen

00:03:50,260 --> 00:04:08,670
this and it also started move to have

00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:10,590
two links with the talks KD

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,580
moving the website on the KD

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:18,450
infrastructure in the blood pressure and

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:22,620
slowly we we integrated any applications

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:25,800
relief and it was a very positive move

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,130
because it allowed us to bed it from the

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,650
ke infrastructure and so the developers

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:40,440
could concentrate more on on the code

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:43,950
unless on website issue cetera run also

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,710
now we have a beautiful and all kind of

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:51,260
services that are part of a key and it's

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,260
very great opportunity for choice

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,920
cookie soap yes I only talked a bit

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:12,810
about this so also being part of any

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:16,390
means because this meeting it's also the

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,730
motivating to people and it's also I

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,390
think very interesting if we can

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:30,580
exchange with other media applications

00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:33,360
like Drita large or the user base then

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:37,810
giving life and Bob more experience I

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,790
think we can believe in an exchange on

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:43,030
communication between D these

00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:45,840
applications because party we we have we

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:52,690
need the same problems on three

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:54,910
headteacher move towards KD also allowed

00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:00,010
us to participate with google summer of

00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:02,550
code for Tommy so we have a contest

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:06,370
student working on an english

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:10,000
integrating care of animations in in re

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:16,900
heart and I hope that we can merge this

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:25,710
folder for end of the year please take

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:28,710
you have questions how it was it was a

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,710
smooth

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:40,450
Mario cooks for the lesson it's on

00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:44,600
mentoring two drivers integrate this

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:46,420
also what I really like is that he yeah

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,030
he helped us to ask us some questions

00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:53,270
for example kind of the mission for

00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:57,200
finding life something which I then we

00:06:53,270 --> 00:07:01,510
sought about the comatose I am myself

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:05,050
playing some video editing there oh my

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:07,970
Bobby a semi-professional and I

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:14,330
developed daily life for what I need so

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:19,250
whiskey it's 40 myself but now let us to

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:22,760
think about defining a mission for pain

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:27,500
in life which means of which sugar on

00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:30,590
this job k-lite should be designed and I

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:35,150
think to have this this vision also will

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:40,330
benefit us to have a better visibility I

00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:47,270
think very interesting reflection which

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:54,200
was not actress I'm personally am very

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:59,020
happy with it also big change is that

00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:02,740
before we need any light version maybe

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:06,569
house either basic series everyone's

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:10,810
because we don't have to manage it

00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:13,990
big help for us the question isn't

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:18,699
forward to friend of my son is it using

00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:21,460
frameworks but come on yeah don't you be

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:26,560
a highly the deep remorse 50 yes sir

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:29,020
sorry yes we did yes and one of the

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,060
problem is eating habits that it's now

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:37,330
is begin a huge program and I feel like

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:42,669
we're we've always doing some buffing

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:44,860
and some without going so but at the

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:49,089
beginning of this year we started to

00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:54,610
move towards a five and we have now

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:59,130
released our first version 15 dot 0 for

00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:06,310
it is based this is single box of a

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:09,089
Fremen him expire and now in in August

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:14,579
we're going to use a second direction

00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:16,720
which integrates some some epic going to

00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:24,670
because we're trying to clean up that

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:27,279
road yes arranged in strand and one of

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,589
the problem is really high is that we

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,020
have been using the energy per box of 10

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:34,529
years and the beginning we were

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:39,060
communicating with ml

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:43,319
through XML to generating xml files i'm

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:46,889
sending them to MLT under this thing's a

00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:49,589
result but now we are have a better

00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:52,920
integration were using the library's

00:09:49,589 --> 00:10:00,439
directly but integral in the code we

00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:05,819
still have some some old ways to work

00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:09,620
that have to be changed to some object

00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:16,309
changes that have to be done to make

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:18,809
roti know that we started is this work

00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:22,170
since the beginning of this year with

00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:27,300
wings on spin on french guy who is also

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:32,850
working with me and we quite happy to of

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:40,410
the results we well know you using a

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:44,059
pipe but it still since sorry because we

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:47,519
need some large architectural changes

00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:51,449
until I hit 11 a big program we have

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,000
some sauce on side effects so when I try

00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:57,050
to prepare my presentation you miss

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,710
Katie I discovered at least five but

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:05,170
this morning

00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:08,530
right so we of work and yes I think we

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:12,970
will it's very difficult to do this from

00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:17,380
half happy if you like we always try to

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:19,120
catch up don't feel too bad about that

00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,920
because when I sit down able to draw

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,510
some English creature within five

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,550
minutes I'm calling again because I

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,220
found a better quality or something

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:33,130
that's not going smooth I don't know how

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:35,920
Rose I just do it the pre pretty much

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:39,610
every video tutorial them written is

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,230
made with Katie alliance here we have

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:47,140
some great food from home users also

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:56,650
people teaching you to keep Swiss

00:11:47,140 --> 00:12:06,940
getting items small video station at the

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:11,290
edifice um oops oh yeah so the weakness

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,180
is a first aid in life yes one of the

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,550
weaknesses that if faison it's also

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,120
strengths that it's better on energy

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,600
energy is not

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,800
well known and worked let's use the

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:29,029
widely and it's mostly goodbye 11 guy so

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,700
this is maybe a bit dangerous to rely on

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:36,529
on such a project but on the other side

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:42,640
Emily I think it's a feeling additional

00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:44,990
very well designed so I mentioned yes

00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,960
refactoring and posting which takes a

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:51,140
lot of of energy and also one thing that

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:54,460
we need for our project is to

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:59,240
communicate more on what's happening

00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:02,420
what we are doing because this we only

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,930
blogging maybe three times a year

00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:10,190
business over the last month's is so

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:12,260
it's not enough and as I said defining a

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:19,850
mission for kiting life I think will be

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:23,779
very good step forward so now the

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:28,100
strength of heading life I said I think

00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:30,950
Emily is a very good project also since

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,480
getting live it's mostly practical

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:36,980
interface you don't need to have

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,620
advanced knowledge of video how video

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:44,120
works to produce a project because it's

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:48,770
mostly an interface so I think it's

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:51,670
quite easy to join the project and then

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:54,579
I can have very many different usages

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:58,179
some people are using it

00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:59,769
a video living some people i use it

00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:03,610
sometimes to make interactive

00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:09,100
presentations so i think you can can be

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:13,629
used in many different ways i think one

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:18,389
of the strategy okay so what we are

00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:23,499
doing now here I important is now done

00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:28,209
and never going to change the code is a

00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:33,009
good progress we have tried to make some

00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:35,619
small goals to that have easier to

00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:42,879
integrate so this is quaint quaint

00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:45,459
smoothly and yes we have to work longer

00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:50,069
on the community I really like also the

00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:55,499
way that theta managed to have users

00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:59,019
posting interviews to test it testy to

00:14:55,499 --> 00:15:02,980
work to show how what they do is

00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:08,230
realizing it's a great way to to make

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:10,410
some Felicity or from Joe we talked

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,410
about

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:27,130
okay and about the future developments

00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:31,330
so we have to think about that was why

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:33,400
it stands a few weeks ago when I saw my

00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,320
sister's kid with ten years old was

00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:39,520
doing video editing on her smartphone

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:43,870
and something that was yeah I was almost

00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,810
not worth it you can do this but so it's

00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:50,080
I think that we have to think about with

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:55,200
what place does aidan life help with the

00:15:50,080 --> 00:16:02,020
evolution of mobile devices only days on

00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:06,100
desktop on I would also like to to

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:11,610
increase communication with ultimate

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,610
rice without using them I think we could

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:23,580
yes it is now they were contamination

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:23,580
features so maybe interactive community

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,950
effort every time someone asked me about

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,020
a feature for create animation it's

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,450
already getting life right already tell

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:37,510
them no we are going to just output of

00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:42,280
virtue finishes and it's wrong

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:45,190
applications job yeah but we can and we

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:55,600
do easy to make this joint transition

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:58,990
easier but I really different goals okay

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,960
and then I i plan to show you some live

00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,630
demos but since i didn't take the

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,860
adapter i couldn't use my my own laptop

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:13,570
so i try to do some screen grabs which

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:15,520
are really shaky just to demonstrate you

00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:18,250
some of the present developments in

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,800
getting light so i just think this this

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:25,260
morning with my laptop and it's just to

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,260
show you the clock direction feature

00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:35,120
front never see also new feature with

00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:37,670
its spring effect to show that Regina

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,910
beyond the video with a effect which

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:44,170
other set of this individual that we are

00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:53,060
going to be used with the next version

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:58,010
August ok so I'm arriving at the end of

00:17:53,060 --> 00:18:01,150
my presentation thanks if you somebody

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,150
has a question

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:37,350
get a knife used to be one now

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:42,510
autonomous is easy to use so since you

00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:47,910
are considering writing why any one

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:50,990
suggestion is not any wine and then

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,990
Morty Harry why

00:18:52,350 --> 00:19:02,640
we really consider to develop an emoji I

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:02,640
can't imagine to me who use the money

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:11,490
well me neither but maybe some kind of

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:15,090
people packages but yes but open chest I

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:21,610
think I think that's a suggestion but

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:23,950
which user is needing like for the

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:29,170
aperture a pension project is now almost

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:32,530
dead for almost two years I don't yeah

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:36,120
it's a I don't know if we have any ways

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:39,670
to I think it to tell you even I'm not

00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,550
wanting to make a very basic video

00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:51,160
application so I mean I think we keep

00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:54,220
this multitrack sorry for many people

00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,670
laptops are not just I mean this is

00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,670
attached

00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:12,100
sorry I was just showing off my laptop

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:14,290
which also is it's touch and yeah

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,350
everything's that everything's becoming

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:26,880
one so saying phones are like they're

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:32,440
smaller yeah hi so i used to get a wide

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:37,420
and it's if you use a lot and it's a

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:40,060
stressful application if the crashes are

00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,620
not horrible the inserts into fig the

00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,910
lock me up in everything pretty bright

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:49,300
often and the thing that may be stuck

00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:54,190
was that the doing the transitions of

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:59,650
living in a house is very serious and

00:20:54,190 --> 00:21:02,580
not well sample and i started using to

00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:07,080
not directly to the market yet category

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:11,800
so I'm wondering if you will integrate

00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,680
more of a cumulative visibly inside you

00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,010
know the oil scripting dignity that I

00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,940
will actually edit maybe with ease the

00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,010
transition

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,470
and the possibilities in terms of many

00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:27,690
nations and rickety birth defects are

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:31,710
amazingly great any get a lot more speed

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:34,240
every ready for the user interface

00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:38,950
getting luck wish I just started to use

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:42,810
qml for the example the monitor speech

00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:47,110
can detect it was an internal and also

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:54,340
the title module in bikini logic device

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:57,030
oh it's very good very it's very hard to

00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:01,090
maintain and what one of the

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:04,210
possibilities is that service webley

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:08,080
effects module in energy that supports

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:10,860
Israel human so I for children I would

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:16,210
really like to use this this energy

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:19,360
module 2 to display qml directly inside

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:22,440
the video which would follow some

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,680
scripting and society session to be

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,680
completely single

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:45,299
are you giving life right here at Orel

00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:49,020
Hershiser so I think I'm we have very

00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:52,309
very smooth him i am the only one who

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:56,400
worked on it from the long time and

00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:59,039
videos ago we had a small team but i

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:05,669
have to stop development of one year but

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:09,029
of health issues and then the builder so

00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:11,340
now mostly things on you know within

00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:18,179
francis working with you that it's

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:20,850
almost all the there is a mass girl

00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:22,500
short boring because we've been through

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:25,440
this justifies our mission statement

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,649
already offering lady that's it where

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,679
you may accumulate and the other

00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:33,960
developers button and if it's just you

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:39,059
and on two of the three mighty too

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,399
intimidating but if you want to work on

00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:43,700
your vicious end I'd love to help with

00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,700
her as well

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:11,330
you talked about the dangers and is it

00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:15,210
about a bit busy group inside the mass

00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:17,940
pike County all our effects only have a

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:22,429
line of transitions and so this would

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:29,030
Louis but this is like busy like terms

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:29,030
in athens in the parameter yes in the

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:41,940
figures like we create a mask and you

00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:45,150
use it try again oh so it's X on effect

00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,100
parameters but it also allows see if you

00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,470
want to move an object on the screen to

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:57,559
move it using curves instead of just

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:57,559
hands awesome so thank you John

00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,960
