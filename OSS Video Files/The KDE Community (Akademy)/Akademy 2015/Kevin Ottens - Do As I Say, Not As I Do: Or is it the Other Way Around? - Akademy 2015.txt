Title: Kevin Ottens - Do As I Say, Not As I Do: Or is it the Other Way Around? - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	This short talk will be a follow up on last year craftsmanship talks. Indeed, it is too easy to lecture people on how to do or not to do something... there must be another, darker side, to this story. Don't be afraid, we'll explore it together, you won't be alone in the dark.

Last year we gave craftsmanship advices spanning from testing, to CI use going through architecture. But do they all work for real? Are there rules we broke in the Zanshin project? Why and when?

In this short talk we'll point out everything we did or we are doing wrong in Zanshin as a counterpoint. This way we can come clean and show how naughty we are as well and how we try to treat ourselves.

	00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:20,369
alright so we have many dogs now which I

00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,369
can you know they're probably man those

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,960
idiots in CVS 10 minutes right I result

00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:34,739
with that with not doing a 10-minute

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:39,430
story but probably a shorter one ok so

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,500
you've seen my talks last year I or if

00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,769
you've seen me in sprains and stuff like

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,660
that you know that I talk a lot about

00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:52,539
craftsmanship that I talk about the test

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,499
and that you should really do TDD as

00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:59,980
Alex I liked it and I'm really sorry

00:00:56,499 --> 00:01:05,110
about everything I said in that context

00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:07,780
I mean look at this guy right right it's

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:11,230
kind of good right look at this guy read

00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:14,860
luke see how serious I am about all that

00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:17,970
right all this stuff that works trust me

00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:22,780
okay I do it I'm a real professional way

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:26,890
but I might have a secret right actually

00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:29,320
yes I've kind of dirty secret even I'm

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:33,189
not really perfect but from it and

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,290
that's actually proof of that I even

00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:37,509
have more proof right so really you

00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,420
should listen to what I say that yet

00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:43,329
don't look at our really do stuff in

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:46,210
reality look at the in the community we

00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:49,149
have this guy okay this David guy unix

00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:54,700
test you should totally do as assays and

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:56,469
as it does or maybe not right this point

00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,490
here is that you need to experience

00:01:56,469 --> 00:02:01,770
things by yourself right because during

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,759
talks that's clearly

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:09,269
whatever we say that's clearly idealized

00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:13,970
to some extent and what we say works and

00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:16,769
that's what you should do but you want

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:20,430
Jenelle you won't do what whatever we

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:24,239
say everyone we find his own style who

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:28,830
through experience by going through

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,370
those advices in some way we can relate

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:36,000
you something which is named shragi

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:38,730
which describes the stages of learning

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,540
in martial arts it's been expanding to

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,190
other fields and so sure that the first

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,670
stage that basically you have to protect

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,620
obey and learn learn the fundamentals

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,110
right and once you bring up with those

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,230
fundamentals that's when you get you the

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,360
hot stage where you detach and you

00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,519
degress founders from the hunters and

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,940
that's where you start breaking with

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,290
tradition the word pointing you breaking

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,450
with tradition to find your own style

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,489
and that's when you get to the rate

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:13,410
stage where you live basically you leave

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:15,109
you step ID from the branch and you

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,120
create your own tradition because you

00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:20,940
everything you do now feels natural and

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,940
you don't ask you to clinch to any

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,670
particular form and watch important that

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,370
it will start with soon right and that's

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,349
why in the towards always idealize it's

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,569
because it's a fond of hunters it's

00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,660
because it's a tradition that we present

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:39,750
there it's also slightly the station

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:43,139
still at so that's why I present this up

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,660
that way and I try to stick to it really

00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,620
and I thought often and that's why you

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,480
should not do as I do but do as I say

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,060
for instance I say test driven

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,620
development okay you should test hers

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,020
and you should have tests for everything

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,920
you

00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,750
use the other well the truth is I did

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,280
skip a few tests right and there are

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,310
tight deadlines it happened a few times

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,110
and I regretted it each time that's what

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,750
matters right it came back at me each

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:14,580
time wasting my own time later and

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:18,730
that's why despite me doing that I say

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:21,040
test driven development I also say keep

00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,350
your test screen you should be asking if

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,040
not more than your feet your code inside

00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,870
of your tests well in practice I did

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,300
some tests by just copy and past

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,280
incurred around right so lots of

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,670
duplicate occurred I let it happen

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,590
especially from new contributors to not

00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,410
to scare them away with having to make

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:44,200
perfect test from the start and why it

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,390
came back at me lowering my possibility

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,860
to refactor and that's why I say keep

00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:53,890
your test clean I also say why we say it

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,190
even more tomorrow I say mark but knock

00:04:53,890 --> 00:05:00,520
temporarily it's especially great to use

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,800
more for emergent design and we cover

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,770
that mall tomorrow or to drive the early

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,310
phases of design discovery but as soon

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:12,100
as you do that you should then

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:15,700
consolidate your card and use real

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:19,120
objects of steps right well the reality

00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:22,210
is I did let mark spread everywhere in

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,850
my tests and temporary became permanent

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,580
and I have lists of tests copper to the

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,590
implementation of my card and came back

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,840
at me lowering my possibility to

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,360
refactor again right and so that's why i

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,990
say more time priority a lot three

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:41,919
examples at just about testing just

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:44,500
about testing and the related failures I

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,740
had with testing so now I let you

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,300
imagine the rest right because I talk

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,620
about architecture as well I

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,479
talk about how you deal with your

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,810
features as well and so on and I have

00:05:53,479 --> 00:06:01,250
failures plenty of them there so please

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:04,520
do as I say not as I do because as we've

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:08,180
seen what i do is what close to me in

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,539
crabtree and avoid the traps I working

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,889
to ok that's the most important and that

00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,710
that's why I have this trick terra

00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:18,710
stands when I am doing talks because

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:22,310
that's the best way for showing a path

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:24,110
to people coming after me right and by

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,080
saying on that path you can improve

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,180
faster than I do that's what matters so

00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:34,810
don't work out those don't work in those

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,810
traps I work in two so thank you and

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:55,979
while I go fust oh so we have time for

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:55,979
questions thank you

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,220
