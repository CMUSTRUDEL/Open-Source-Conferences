Title: Jos van den Oever - UNESCO PERSIST: Preserving Digital Heritage - Akademy 2015

Description: 
	UNESCO has a project to preserve our digital heritage. This project includes many archivists and some industry partners e.g. Microsoft. It also includes a few people that promote
and know about FOSS. UNESCO really wants to promote sustainable software and
file formats going forward. At the last meeting yesterday, at UNESCO headquarters in Paris it was decided to start a pilot. I proposed to involve FOSS communities to bootstrap the effort. I want to people from get FOSS communities like KDE, GNOME, Firefox, Debian and many, many more involved.
These are the goals for the near future:

* Build a global community to raise awareness around sustainable computing.
We all know that that means FOSS and Open Standards. UNESCO knows this in
theory but does not feel it in their bones yet, like we do.
* provide technology to run stream VMs to your desktop so you can have a VM with e.g. KDE 1 running in 10 seconds. This works today on Linux, but it's not available on distros yet.
* provide tools to render old file formats on modern computers. The Document
Liberation Project can help here, but also Calligra can.

Presenting this project to the KDE Community, is a
great start. The technology in the project is intrinsically useful to KDE (real easy debugging and sharing of dev setups, KDE wayback machines, any software running in Olive also runs as remote software on tablets).
KDE has an awesome community and great facilities for supporting this community. I would love input from KDE on how to bootstrap a community for digital sustainability under the UNESCO flag and Akademy would be a great platform to get cross-pollination between KDE and UNESCO going.

	00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:19,290
it's time for a second after them this

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:25,050
video is not just on them over yeah

00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:30,869
a.g.o sasaki since 2005 he has working

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:33,390
in calera weblogic al DF and three just

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,370
is there a colleague representative of

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,140
the open document format at places a

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,520
this presentation is going to be allowed

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,250
in esco persist that is a working on as

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,010
canaries trying to preserve they are

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,129
eater in arrogance thank you for the

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:57,410
perspective ok thank you for the

00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:00,059
introduction graphs with everybody so a

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,760
topic which is not entirely completely

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,509
Katie but it will let you very much too

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,149
Katie so this is about the UNESCO assist

00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:12,240
program going to start off by explaining

00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:16,560
what it is how it came to be and how it

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,210
relates to kaylee so tiny bit about me

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,229
already gotten introductions learners

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,600
can be short I am a long time kitty

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,360
contributor I used to work for a company

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,159
in doing only a lot of KD development

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,939
but currently I work for the mystery of

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,250
the interior in the downloads the

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,540
government when we publish many many

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,790
documents in a lot of file formats also

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,840
the creator of web o DF which is a

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,829
library in which you can show an edit

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,329
documents in a web browser okay the

00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:54,500
actual topic then well in esco it's a

00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:57,319
fairly famous name of course in the

00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,170
world it's an important institution who

00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:02,600
seeks to help peace in the world and

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,939
health understanding between cultures by

00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,250
education and also by preserving

00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:11,510
cultural heritage I think most of the

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,090
sites or most of the things you know

00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,010
when asked about is about them

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,780
preserving parts of the earth parts

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,930
cultural things that we made but also

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,989
nature and here you see a few examples

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:27,170
the Taj Mahal some pyramids the Great

00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:28,519
Wall of China that's all very things but

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,280
they do more they also have a program

00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,220
which is called memory of the world and

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,129
then they save artifacts and documents

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:40,129
which are value or they don't take

00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:41,959
themselves but they they find them out

00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:44,650
and then they give them a special status

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,390
and this special status requires

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:51,139
countries that are part of an esco to

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,880
take extra care of these documents well

00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:56,389
are some examples here as well you have

00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:01,010
clay tablets you have a big chemistry

00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:03,889
here in the corner some old medicinal

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,319
books also modern things like movies and

00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:08,660
photos can be in there other things that

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,150
can be in there can be large collections

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,519
of documents for example some city

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,500
archive which gives a particularly good

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,650
view of the history of the city can also

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,859
be a part of memory of the world all the

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:25,400
audio files goals to be part of it so

00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:27,680
it's quite quite wide but there's

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,560
another type of things which we make as

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,930
humans which can also be important to

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,480
preserve for the future digital heritage

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,680
right for example clipart from the 80s

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,470
maybe somebody in the future would like

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,290
to look at it or a tamagotchi

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:48,490
that work why do people create that it's

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,860
also helping to future generations

00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,360
understand how we are living today maybe

00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,580
they would like to compile the first

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,930
little external or even today's linux

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:03,380
kernel in 100 years time some file

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,410
formats like vrml are not even really

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,030
supported today anymore so how can we

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:12,080
still view them even though they were

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:15,850
very hot in the 90s and other big things

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,560
maybe like the Great Firewall of China I

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,970
actually only put that on the India jump

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,560
because I don't really think we can

00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:26,270
preserve it yeah so how do I deserve

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,130
world heritage well for sites is

00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,510
obviously we protect them and we make

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,360
agreements with the countries where they

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,830
are to take care of them for documents

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,780
we store them and artifacts we also

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,510
store them and we can scan them and make

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,340
them available online for digital it

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,710
seems very easy to preserve them just

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,780
copying koppiyam 500 times make a lot of

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,120
backups and they were done well actually

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,950
it's not that easy we can have the

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,220
copies we can have the zeros in the ones

00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:55,040
but but then we are hardware is

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,430
currently constantly changing so

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,180
software that works today probably won't

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,430
work can probably work with not software

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,840
works today might not work in five years

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,960
time when the computers are different

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,210
operating system is different so we need

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,850
not really need to do more than just

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,490
preserve preserve the data we need to

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:20,060
also be able to for example emulate the

00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:23,630
hardware or keep the hardware and we

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,840
need to have licenses licenses trachea I

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,180
showed you the the big size right the

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,200
pyramids 3,000 years old but I think

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,450
copyright law

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,250
live longer than 3,000 years so we have

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,380
to somehow make an agreement with the

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,560
guys who have the copyrights that we are

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,750
allowed to show it to other people who

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,520
are interested in in it even if it

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,490
suffer from the 80s that was using

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,120
anymore we still need to have the

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,440
licenses to be able to show it to people

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,810
the other thing is not the software

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,410
itself but the documents created with

00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,300
the software if you have this clip art

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:03,380
or the vrml which was created with

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,510
software from 20 years ago you cannot

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,780
usually open it anymore with software

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:11,450
today so how do we deal with that well

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:16,670
to face these issues in esco start as a

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:18,380
project called persists and so far it's

00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,210
quite a young project there have been

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,790
several meetings on planning how to take

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,440
care of this obviously preserving

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,960
digital content is not something unique

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,940
to UNESCO but in esco seeing now that

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,770
they should also have an opinion about

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,190
it and have good practices for how to do

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,470
this so there were meetings papers

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:40,690
written about their plans and we are now

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:43,610
planning for a proof of concept of a

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,340
repository for digital content and for

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:52,120
tools to make repositories for digital

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:54,410
contents well I talked a bit about the

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,570
strategies which are things we need to

00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:01,820
take care one of the things we can do is

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:04,340
emulate if you have old software from 85

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,710
you can on a modern computer emulate

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,750
that computer and still run the old

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:12,080
software and if you have a document from

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:15,380
85 you could then open the document in

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,690
the emulator this is approach an

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,720
approach which is taken by the olive

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,330
project which is advising UNESCO and

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,349
they have a software called

00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:32,020
net x and what it does is it is an easy

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:33,400
way to emulate hardware if you currently

00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,770
want to emulate hardware you have to

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:41,590
download virtual image which can be very

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:44,199
large then install the emulator and open

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,349
open the iso file open the virtual file

00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,319
in your emulator and start working this

00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:52,060
project makes it easier because it

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,360
downloads a virtual machine on the mound

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,969
this only works on linux because you'll

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,819
see later why but you can also run it to

00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:02,830
a movie so then you have the emulation

00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:05,860
running in the cloud somewhere and you

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:09,129
can see the old machine in windows or

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,099
android or linux this project was

00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:16,120
started by such a from he's a professor

00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:18,909
at Carnegie Mellon and this is what the

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,099
website looks like so this is all of

00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:23,949
archive and there you have a list of

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:27,940
virtual machines here you see the mosaic

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:31,979
browser on the Macintosh there's a

00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:34,510
launch so am I future yeah oh great

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:37,810
there's a launch button here when you

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:40,240
press that then you instantly start the

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,370
virtual machine and if you press the

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,070
cloud button here then you are directed

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,720
to you all so that you don't decide the

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:50,019
machine locally but you started in the

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,630
cloud and they have a repository with a

00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:54,339
whole number of these virtual machines

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:58,420
which you can go back and you can travel

00:08:54,339 --> 00:09:00,699
back in time with them now the these

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,060
lists this list is not public yet

00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:06,970
because partly because of licensing

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,649
issues so i have an i have an account

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:13,120
here and that's why i can act and open

00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:14,800
this but the software is open source but

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:21,070
there's no public repository of this yet

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,570
a bit about how this works you install

00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,480
the old software on a virtual machine

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:30,430
you start the virtual machine and then

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:32,110
you hibernated and this hibernate this

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,320
hibernated file is what you publish on a

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,390
web site you linked

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,920
cloud image and then the client comes

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,200
along and it presses the button on the

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,390
website and then your machine will mount

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,580
the memory and the disk image which fuse

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,590
and it will start q give you on the

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,150
clients and download all the parts of

00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,950
the file system on the map so you don't

00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,710
have to download everything this is all

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,660
taken care of for you by the software so

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,430
it's very a very convenient way of

00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:01,730
running old machines running all

00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:04,340
software well emanation is nice but

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,040
there's not enough to make documents and

00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:12,350
old content available to to modern

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:16,250
systems because new users they don't

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:18,080
know the old software if you if you are

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,540
on dos well I don't think that most

00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,540
people today know does they are familiar

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:27,650
with Android and iOS and they use the

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,120
finger to interact with the machine they

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:32,360
won't be able to handle this all

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:36,500
software so not everybody will be happy

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,510
with just an emulation if you want to

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,790
take content from an old document and

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,500
combine it with a new document you need

00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,090
to be able to access the information but

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,530
if it's only in software which is

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,800
running in the am later you still can't

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:51,800
get to the content and you'd like to be

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,630
able to index your files perhaps or so

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,460
that you can search all do a big

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,560
analysis if you have a whole lot of

00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,540
files a whole database from all times

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,220
and you would like to do it an analysis

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,990
on those files you need to have software

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:10,490
which modern software which understands

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:12,460
the old file format and this is where

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,800
the document liberation project comes in

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:19,340
this was started by Felix liver he is a

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:23,270
liberal office developer and he wanted

00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,640
to improve our ability to open old house

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,890
and old formats so he's collecting

00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,860
documentation about his old old file

00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,620
formats and he's figuring out what the

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,980
what the

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,540
format looks like inside and writing

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,839
free software to extract information

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,670
from from the file formats or even write

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,100
software so that we can convert the old

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:47,550
files to a modern standards the open

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,950
document file format so yeah these guys

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,500
are constantly in these type of views

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,150
and they have a binary editor where they

00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,790
try to understand what the old file

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,529
format it looks like and then they write

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,050
software so they can still open it and

00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:03,930
it was all this that well your old files

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:08,190
like ms presenter or the page maker get

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:10,020
converted to ODF or epub and when they

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,880
have converted to the standard then you

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,510
can open them with modern software like

00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,850
Microsoft Office we will offers calleja

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:23,640
yeah and we are still access to these

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:25,950
old files using a standard that's nice

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,740
and so going forward we should try to

00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:31,800
use only standards as much as possible

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,330
and this is something that in esky

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,070
should also be promoting they should say

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,779
look we have all these strange file

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,050
formats which we need to do a lot of

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:42,450
work on to be able to read them still

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:44,279
but we need to also set standards so

00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:48,660
that in the future this problem can be

00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:50,730
avoided and even though we have

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,790
standards now like ODF we still have

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,800
some issues because if somebody is

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,450
editing in microsoft offers somebody

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,420
else in google docs somebody else in the

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:04,320
office and they're saving to ODF or to

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:06,630
docx this is how these implementations

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,900
have different ideas about the details

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:12,120
of the standards so everybody who's done

00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,190
this kind of juggling which files knows

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,300
that sooner or later something will go

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:22,380
wrong right so it sounds good but we

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,320
also need testing and we need to test

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,220
the implementations and for that some

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,720
other projects like

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:33,120
office shots and ODF auto tests which

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,890
loads user files in office suites then

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,530
they save them back and then they check

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,330
if it's still a valid file and odie of

00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,330
all the tests does the same but not with

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,850
user files but it just creates a lot of

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,370
files from the specification and then

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,890
test specific features and what you get

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,900
then is some nice overviews for all the

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,220
implementations with checkboxes and if

00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,810
you have a lot of checkboxes you can

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:59,700
make graphs and get a sort of you know

00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:03,060
how good an implementation is in a

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,130
particular file format so those are

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,070
three methods in which in esco can

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:11,700
contribute to preserving digital

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:14,670
heritage mostly we are now looking back

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,520
so we provide emulation and we develop

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:19,560
converters for old file formats but

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,620
going forward we have to encourage good

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,480
practices so use well tested

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:30,390
implementations that implement

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:31,890
well-documented standards okay so I

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:37,020
haven't really mentioned que te at all

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:39,450
yet in this big drawing there's some

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:43,590
room for Katie what is this this is sort

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:46,680
of a rough overview of the components of

00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,650
this website and this repository and the

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,240
letters are too small for you to read

00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:54,540
but here we have continuous integration

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,300
which we are very good at here's the

00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,160
word software ATA software so this all

00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,110
this software here is supposed to be

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,300
August all software it should we should

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,540
we enesco doesn't want to have propriety

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,370
software to build this because then they

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,060
would be dependent on a single vendor

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:14,510
which is not a good idea and by the way

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:18,900
Microsoft is also in this working group

00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:20,649
and they have their own ideas which they

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:24,129
put forward in this world

00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:26,589
let me put it like that here it says

00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:29,920
open source community right so the open

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:32,649
source community we is supposed to also

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:38,040
provide input here and provide input

00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:40,779
into these tools and I think that KDE is

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,779
very well suited or has good practices

00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:48,369
that can help in bringing this forward

00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:52,149
and the reason for that is we have a

00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:55,779
manifesto and now the manifesto of KDE

00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:58,480
says we should ensure that the result of

00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:03,249
our work is available to all people for

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,800
all time and I don't know the flowers

00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:07,689
were built a pyramid also had these kind

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,610
of ideas where we should be should be

00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:12,249
forever eternity this is what this is

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,550
what our manifesto says so yeah maybe we

00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:19,050
should also try to help adopt some good

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,610
practices and maybe even communicate

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,629
with the persist project at UNESCO and

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:27,990
help them out to make this possible

00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,990
that's my talk

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:49,250
you seem like a good point of contact it

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:59,810
is there any movement in katy to make

00:16:49,250 --> 00:17:03,340
sure our old software is mostly what KDE

00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:05,870
still has available is source archives

00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:10,220
most of them won't compile anymore i

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:12,860
think if the above a certain age there

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,570
was when i was preparing for this talk i

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,760
actually looked through what katie

00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:21,430
provides and the oldest thing I could

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:29,380
find that I could still use was an ISO

00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:29,380
with a live CD of KDE to that wasn't I

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:46,300
haven't built the heart of things that

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:46,300
are needed yeah also around

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,330
this is the first time that I'm

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:56,560
communicating about this publicly yeah

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,960
so because since the end of last year

00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:03,580
I've been to a couple of these meetings

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,590
and the people there are very mixed but

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,770
it's only a few open source people

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,870
actually which so that's why I'm

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,160
continuing continuing to go there

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:17,110
because I think it's an important voice

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,940
that needs to be heard there and now

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,980
that I've written this presentation this

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,080
is a nice starting point to start

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,850
writing a blog post about it on the

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,650
other hand there's also meetings going

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,690
on still to make these plans and

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,640
obviously I don't want to interfere them

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,460
too much but I think just writing a

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,100
promo blog about it is it is not a bad

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:53,740
thing to do so that would be a good next

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:57,310
step I think yes yes yeah yeah yes ya

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,710
know my involvement was like a bit less

00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,350
than a year ago but this group has been

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:10,870
discussing this since to us tune of

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:12,790
years no no this is that there's there's

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,100
no sis admins involved at all yet I mean

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:21,400
this is just their states out all

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:24,280
meetings and paper and the poppy the the

00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,870
subject project the deal projects is

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,000
somebody who is present at the last

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,770
meeting and said this is open source

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,480
software you can start using that and

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,610
the same goes for free like Shiva so we

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,530
have some components well because which

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,900
we can start using but it still has to

00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:40,120
be put together into a website which

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,550
requires either input from the open

00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,490
source community who simply helps out or

00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:47,410
in SQL say here we have some funds to

00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,930
hire some professional developers who

00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,480
work on it in pay time but the lattice

00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,370
thing requires some Brock receipt in

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,920
escrow to

00:19:53,370 --> 00:20:02,430
move it forward right so that hasn't

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:05,610
happened yet but obviously if volunteers

00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:08,910
say oh let's just build it and make it

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:11,280
available to an esco that would really

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,170
help move things along just like the

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:22,470
document liberation project simply

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:26,220
started we will try to make QE will work
