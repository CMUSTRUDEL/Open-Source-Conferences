	00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,720
I'm just gonna sit here because it's

00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:16,059
later the Dail and lazy so it's cute a

00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,860
road to mobile domination so I'm working

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,050
at the company writing apps and we've

00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,670
been using cute for one and a half years

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,619
now for apps and so I'm just going to

00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,830
share my experience in the past what

00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:29,620
does improve what hasn't and so West

00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,960
rather sad news number one so the cute

00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,300
company discontinued the indie mobile

00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,660
license and professional license so they

00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,940
used to be a india-mobile license for 25

00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:43,539
euros a month or something which would

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:46,539
give you like the legalizing security

00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:48,820
because on iOS it's difficult with lgpl

00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:51,129
and also an Android I think it's kind of

00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,019
a different a difficult situation if

00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:55,780
you're not writing open source software

00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:58,839
so for KDE that thing is not that big of

00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,010
a deal but for potential customers

00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:03,789
especially with the indian mobile

00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:06,250
license it was a really nice offer for

00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:09,490
smaller companies to try to get into

00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,829
cute and maybe do more with cute later

00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,850
and the professional license was also

00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:18,060
for mobile only in orders trust a

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,070
enterprise something license which is

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,049
like 10 times the price of the indian

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:29,740
mobile license and covers everything and

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:33,549
set this number to blackberry cute 5 is

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:36,340
now unmaintained since april or march i

00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:38,740
think which is pretty sad especially

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,990
because i moved to a blackberry like to

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,170
we afterwards I didn't notice or I

00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,409
didn't know it back then but the good

00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:50,200
thing is with the recent my 3.2 update

00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,850
cute quick to Android applications now

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,000
run in blackberry they didn't on

00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:58,390
10-point 3.1 for some reason I think

00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,079
because they're runtime didn't support

00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,149
some require so with 10 53.1 you can run

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,500
cute android applications on an

00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,009
operating system

00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:14,770
running cute so this guy would be really

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:17,530
proud of you and that's actually the

00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:20,710
cute everywhere demo the Android version

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,800
and whether demos and performance wise

00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:26,500
they're running pretty well so what has

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,540
improved so there's now an Android cute

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,390
quick control style so Android native

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,670
looking cute quick control style that's

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,680
obviously not the one but that one is so

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,230
if you're using cute quick controls on

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,470
Android I think also for widgets and not

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:45,520
sure then you get native looking

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,709
controls like the menu and check boxes

00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,959
and everything and by native looking I

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,920
mean on startup I think at the kukri

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,060
controls too tall he said that it's

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,220
insane what they're doing and basically

00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,620
on first startup of the application it

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,290
extracts a lot of assets and dumps them

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:06,100
in some temp folder of your app to use

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:09,730
it later it's looking pretty well

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:12,970
actually and even if i come and develop

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,830
a vendor of android device messes around

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,840
with the style it still works pretty

00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,280
well with animations and busy indicator

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,209
looking strange and everything but gets

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,910
pretty gnarly stirred something like

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,870
this also accessibility is now available

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:31,030
so on iOS and Android if you use

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,190
accessible dot roll and button and

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,130
accessible name which you really should

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,840
if you're not using like your quick

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,269
control switch do that for you then you

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,320
get this i don't know if you can see yes

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:46,480
you can see the orange the green weird

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,480
rectangle is the current selection and

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,720
then you get this weird robot voice

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,640
reading aloud what you

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,390
currently selected you can DoubleTap the

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,940
mostest on press action handler and then

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:03,620
does stuff so that's pretty nice to be

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:05,300
no accessibility so other notable

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,050
improvements there's no bluetooth low

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:12,410
energy support on iOS and the media

00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:14,450
player is also working on iOS pretty

00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,920
well entered also the last time I tried

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,170
if you fight when two or something you

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,709
couldn't even do remote streaming so now

00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:23,870
media player working pretty nice user

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,120
interface user experience integration is

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,580
significantly improved so we have a lot

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,580
of platform menu stuff on various

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,790
platforms and everything and also q 3d

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,880
it's not yet support an iOS right but

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:40,190
other than that it's working pretty well

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,470
as on Android and canvas 3d where you

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:46,550
can use HTML l stuff and then poured it

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:49,100
too qml pretty easily and obviously with

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,650
one code base you can well actually it

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,680
should be six screenshots because of the

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,080
plasma phone but as you can see I'm its

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,340
own code base and it's five different

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,080
apps basically they all look pretty

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:05,210
similar because I didn't spend too much

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,210
time with the other platforms so from

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,130
the left to right you can see its iOS

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,210
then they may have android windows phone

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:16,400
blackberry 10 and ubuntu phone and maybe

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:20,390
even than the plasma phone in the future

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,570
and so you can see with the with cute

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:25,669
you can really have a lot of common code

00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,700
so in our apps i did a totally

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:31,790
scientific measurement with clock and my

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,160
folders and then i figure that so the

00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:38,919
blue thing on the left is the

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,270
application itself it's a massive jumel

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,950
construct with little secrets plus

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,870
because everything is modular so it's

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:48,410
loading a lot of gmail files for all the

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:50,300
different sections on the page so that's

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,380
why it's pretty massive and that one

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,360
actually doesn't have any platform

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,820
code in there except for some stuff like

00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,410
if Android then use this button graphic

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,420
iOS use this one but no native platform

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,390
specific code then the library is the

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,640
other big bunch and then we have not

00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,920
even a third of the entire app is

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,150
platform-specific so Android is like I

00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,450
don't know three and a half thousand

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:18,480
lines of code including rapper java

00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:21,270
classes because on Android it's easier

00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,760
if you just like write a Java class

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,730
which then call from C++ rather than

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,850
trying to do Java stop Maya C++ like

00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,470
getting emails and then calling methods

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,510
and creating objects and everything so

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,430
just make a java class call it it does

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,170
everything and then returns to you and

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,790
as I admitted it's a bit more because I

00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:42,150
always have this wrapper stuff in

00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:45,480
between and iOS is basically the same in

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:48,180
the dark red one is other platforms

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,460
which is windows for a blackberry but

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,950
there I didn't bother with most of the

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,050
integration so they don't have

00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:57,450
advertisement tracking stuff video

00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,000
streaming blah blah blah because it was

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:03,930
more of a proof of concept that it can

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,300
be done in afternoon kind of thing so

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,550
outlook has nothing to do with Microsoft

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,620
all because a cute quick control style

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,410
for Windows Phone and Windows RT coming

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,810
it was even supposed to land in 5.5 but

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,300
was postponed a couple of days for

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,730
before release and that's also cute

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,660
positioning which can give you access to

00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:28,910
I think openstreetmap in stuff you can

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:32,430
draw maps in qml previously then also I

00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:35,130
did a bunch of mobile API improvements

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,800
on starting in 5.6 because finally we

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:41,610
could decide an icky ml API for it you

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,940
can adjust the on-screen keyboard enter

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,740
key quite out of it so you can now

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,490
change it to like the search bar send

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,849
back previous whatever so like when the

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,349
keyboard waving

00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:58,059
trusted so thank you for attention if

00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:00,429
you're interested in more native

00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:03,729
integration how to interface Android

00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:07,270
travel stuff with C++ and cute go visit

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:26,139
my workshop on Monday I think 1230 is

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:28,860
enroute so this is today this magnitude

00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,860
go inside

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,820
