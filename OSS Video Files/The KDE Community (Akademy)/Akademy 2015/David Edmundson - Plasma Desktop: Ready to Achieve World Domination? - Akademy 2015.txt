Title: David Edmundson - Plasma Desktop: Ready to Achieve World Domination? - Akademy 2015
Publication date: 2016-04-02
Playlist: Akademy 2015
Description: 
	Last Akademy we were preparing for our first 5.0 release. A year has passed, and we can reflect back on the highs and lows of the release; where we're heading and the future of the Plasma Desktop

Plasma as a desktop environment is still very much a key player in the desktop world and it's important to create a product we can all get behind.

In this talk I will discuss the changes that have happened over the past year, the challenges we have taming an overwhelmingly huge codebase and most importantly where we'll going over the next few years.

	00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,710
okay i'm here to talk white part of the

00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,330
desktop normally when you talk about

00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,639
plasma we do talk about the multiple

00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,340
devices but give me full Senior Program

00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:20,320
I don't need to do that he could is

00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,649
going for an entire talk about coming up

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,210
which allows me to spend half an hour

00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:30,579
wasting the time talking surely about

00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:32,470
what we're doing on your desktop side so

00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:34,930
I'm going to talk about why your car my

00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,360
desktop is still important aspects of

00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,760
witnesses and all if you can look

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,690
forward to not just in five but for but

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,360
moving forward so into the mood of a

00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:50,530
kind of heard yesterday or your desktop

00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:54,700
not relevant lots of points but I have a

00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:58,420
grass so first is it best of relevant

00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:00,850
and the blue line shows number of hours

00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,800
use on a desktop green is number of

00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,570
hours views on a mobile and we can see

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,090
mobile is getting more and more and more

00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,700
important but it's not actually at the

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,220
expense of people work when your desktop

00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,020
people still spend just as much time on

00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,390
your desktop and still as relevant now

00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,620
as it was two years ago there's no sign

00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,090
of it waving despite doom and gloom is

00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,790
low if your hardware manufacturers

00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,549
because the limitation in computing is

00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:31,210
no longer the speed of your computer

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:33,820
it's your software providing fast to use

00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,860
software so it's an interesting form for

00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,750
us to solve now it's a software problem

00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,369
valve and hardware so hard on

00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:44,110
manufactures are scared we should be

00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:46,210
excited and you just obvious best of

00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,470
still relevant is the Linux desert feel

00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:52,210
relevant again another graph again it's

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,340
not really waving it's not shooting up

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,619
we're not winning everything but it's

00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,360
also not going down and if we're excited

00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:02,049
to write a desert before we should still

00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,750
be excited now and I put it to you for

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,000
your presentation that plasma is the

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,830
best in the linear desktops and it's

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,700
going to be a best of all of the desktop

00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:15,890
including a proprietary windows

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:17,870
no effect in the future hopefully so

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,450
what's the goal of a carbon desktop

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:25,519
what's the point of desktops in general

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:28,310
and why do you use it and it's purely

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,050
for one thing to get stuff done as in

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,410
Thai reason you turn on the computer

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,739
where the getting stuff done means

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:41,269
watching YouTube sending an angry email

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:44,420
to an estate agent or writing code or

00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:46,730
making a video it all things up us what

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,250
you use a computer for and in everything

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,590
we do in plasma is trying to help you

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,989
get stuff done everything from the

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,940
window management to being able to newer

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,970
windows around snapped edges and

00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,280
edgewood your virtual desktops and such

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:04,400
what we have type of activities to group

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,959
and context you can work faster cave on

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,599
us you can find things in launching

00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,720
faster blues you can find your finals

00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,060
faster everything that we do in Kozma is

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:19,040
all about getting your stuff done first

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,930
making you more productive and more the

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,269
mantras or if adopted and plasma over

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,579
the last year's is simple by default

00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:28,040
powerful when needed that really fits in

00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:30,440
with getting stuff done you want things

00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,420
simple so you can do things we've

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,459
simplified the network manager so you

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,680
just click one button you're on your

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:40,250
Wi-Fi you'll get it your work then again

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,989
but you can still do everything else you

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,880
can still connect your VPN you can still

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,500
do all the advanced features if you need

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,870
to because that's what you need to be

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:53,060
productive so what what separates

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,880
partner from the competition what are

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,739
our strengths that make us good are

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,480
making you more productive compared with

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:04,910
all your desktop environments alka what

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,700
we've this huge existing code base we've

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:11,620
been going for 19 years or legal

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,620
drinking age even in Canada

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,209
and we can really benefit from that

00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,769
there's a lot of new desktops coming up

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,100
but I don't benefit from this we're in a

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:24,890
winning position because of this

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:29,600
powerful plasma is me via shell no Quinn

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:31,160
Quinn makes a quarter of plasma the

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,230
shell with all your widgets and

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,900
everything else for plasma then as half

00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,360
of just miscellaneous things that you

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,520
need to make it desktop work so when we

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,380
seized 12 top window managers getting a

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,400
lot of excitement it's still got a lot

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:48,380
of work to do to actually be usable to

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,120
be something that you want to use for

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,120
your production to get your stuff done

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,890
taking just system settings just four

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,140
modules of all the different

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:03,110
configurations and your little demons up

00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:05,540
and now your settings to one is around

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,820
60 thousand lines of code and as you use

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,700
a co-curricular model to estimate a

00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,650
development time apps 11.7 man years of

00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,280
development to get all of your settings

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,900
and that's useful because even though

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,700
you probably only use five percent of

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,130
your settings for all the years of

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,230
distally five percent so it takes a long

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,690
time to actually get to our system a

00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:30,340
desktop which everybody benefits from

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,960
and we've got that we're winning enough

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,850
and we've got everything on new code

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,510
everything in plasma shell was all cute

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:42,080
quick and keep quick is two things with

00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,850
qml a javascript which means everything

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,720
is faster prototype we're easy to

00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:50,450
develop from but it's also very crushed

00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,190
safe if will not pick those wrong your

00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,820
entire desktop still playing up is just

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,290
a warm-up let up Mike malfunction you're

00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,350
safer it's a safety system and

00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:03,680
everything's OpenGL of a park you quit

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,790
using OpenGL for very fast stuff and

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,970
just caught again and again in order

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,940
reviews Ars Technica says plasma five is

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,820
snappy considerably snappy and its

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,770
predecessor so we don't know it's a fast

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:21,660
are certain because we're benefiting

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:24,120
from these new tools and RP as good if

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,480
you go and read it people love us I'll

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,120
be accredited or not a biter to people

00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,310
but they love us with our reception

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,920
generally is green positive in the

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:40,080
community and one things I think you can

00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,690
benefit from in plasma competitive

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,570
anyone else is integrating applications

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,370
into work space because up again pops

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,050
productivity and some screenshots of my

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,350
days we've had and things have been

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:56,190
working on getting chance until shell

00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:59,160
emails the calendar integration and we

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,710
can do it because we have some sort

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,020
level control over the applications and

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,240
the plasma team we were together but

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,170
harmony where there's none of the other

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,650
big history's big desktops have that

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,720
crossover it is more even windows and I

00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:19,020
was they don't control applications as

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:22,050
much as we hover over them so something

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:28,490
up we can win over compared with anyone

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:31,260
else it's one of our strongest point and

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,990
as business great software business is

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,970
useless Munich government we all know

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,580
about egg using partner we should all be

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,630
very proud of this is business software

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:45,680
as a screenshot of someone making some

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,680
movie thing

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:51,700
how did my research and it's very

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:54,340
identity than identifiably plasma for

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,280
free you know get to know listening to

00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,130
enya and plasma and business is I using

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,020
our software our software is if its

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,560
usual for businesses excuses people are

00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,810
loan again to get stuff done and if

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,550
businesses find us that's good that

00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,610
means long term money will be coming in

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:18,790
everything's good if we can be business

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:22,260
great software unfortunately it's not

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:26,950
all rainbows and unicorns we do suck in

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:30,090
some places so where the result with

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:32,740
what is huge existing code base and

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:36,280
large sections are on maintenance we've

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,740
been written 20 years ago idea I have

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,400
not been really cooperative little

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,610
maintainer gossip proper job or wife and

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,560
four kids and people live on on some of

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,490
our modules have fallen to the wayside

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:56,050
we've got support for systems that don't

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:59,020
exist anymore we support gdm one in

00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,980
there in when we're switching uses lots

00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:07,600
of stuff which is just tragically unused

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:11,320
that we need to cause of problems so

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,640
listen we do need people to start a dog

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,390
thing these less maintained modules are

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:22,720
better than the audible are to be honest

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:24,940
good work system settings most modules

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,250
in there are unmaintained and they are

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,520
building up bugs a bucking plasma shell

00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:33,310
and get a comment within 24 hours either

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,100
confirming or resolving issue or

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:40,230
marketing duplicates some of your system

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:44,130
system modules k hotkeys not so much

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:47,590
another problem and we do need you guys

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:50,500
the way I enter on you you guys to step

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,120
up and say I've noticed this problem

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,279
with week maybe no one has mental

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,769
illness maybe I should look at

00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,930
fighting s or just go through its one

00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,360
component in bugzilla and making sure

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,660
this part to get our we do need more

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,519
people to step over and adoptions not

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,660
adopting a dog in your mother last time

00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:13,360
for plasma obviously and we use the

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,629
latest pet which of a problem leah says

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,790
to hit new bugs we've hit is screen

00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:20,350
management bugs and cute spin one of the

00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,720
biggest point we've had it's all been

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:25,180
fixed it takes a while for everyone to

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,449
catch up we've now got a problem into

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:31,899
new graphics drivers because we're using

00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:33,970
advanced stuff and their risk if it hit

00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,889
in these problems but hope this will go

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,920
away with time now our plasmids gone

00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:40,540
through its big jump we're not going to

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,720
go for any more big jump too soon so

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:48,970
over time this problems going to go

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:51,999
right or keep six oh yeah oh yeah as

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,769
more big jumps coming but using the

00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:56,230
latest tech does all of public record

00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:58,269
those problems as well so we need people

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,220
to be at least be running the latest

00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:02,980
cubes we can catch these things early

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,559
there was a problem q 525 that was found

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,959
identified and fixed before it all came

00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:13,019
out which could have been a problem but

00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:13,019
it wasn't because we have people testing

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:20,740
and up here our website on Kady dorg for

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,769
plasma still has pictures from plasma

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,509
fall and what it is in long terms of

00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,850
faucet a moment and that's not

00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:32,050
necessarily a bad thing to keep for a

00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,839
while a year-long from 520 it does kind

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,910
of implied than not doing a very

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,759
brilliant job on Keeping Up with our

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,889
websites and that's where it first point

00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:44,500
of contact for new users will be sure

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:51,699
your website so we have a lot of work we

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:56,499
can do improve enough and i said before

00:11:51,699 --> 00:12:00,429
us this is great you will used it there

00:11:56,499 --> 00:12:02,439
are nichols have a problems which can be

00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,680
annoying which would stop adoption we

00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:05,360
need to get

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,279
that's being better QA missiles are

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,450
working on things are only going to get

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:18,500
better but with plasma 5 on the initial

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:24,920
releases maybe one by air so what I've

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:26,870
been doing 65 in terror focus is always

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,050
been on fixing bugs because over the

00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:33,410
last year distros and our documents 580

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:35,029
came out last Academy pretty much but it

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,130
took a while for district to pick us up

00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,040
to be a default and over the last year

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:43,450
that's happened and the reviews have

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,760
generally been good we did do a good job

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,560
but bugs still came pouring in as we got

00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,180
new users testing things you weren't

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:57,610
expecting over the last year we closed

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,610
3107 bucks which is an impressive number

00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:06,569
what's more impressive is that we've had

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:11,519
three thousand one hundred and seven

00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:13,319
months through the priority have really

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,480
been getting back to you in five level

00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:18,449
as pretty as possible but also to

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,540
identify what's up Colin reaches parcel

00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:24,029
plasma and then polish and texture maybe

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:28,290
it might need mean a revised about long

00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:31,379
section like touchpad wasn't working God

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:34,110
completing you in life and we again is

00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:37,489
identify a weak area fix it identify

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:40,139
with Harriet fix it there's no more huge

00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:42,739
revolutionary jumps just evolutionary

00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:47,009
constant incrementally incrementally

00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:48,629
improving our software and us what we've

00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:53,399
been doing and that's what we're going

00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:57,199
to continue doing onwards so what's

00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,199
coming up what can we be excited about

00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:04,529
in five go for we have these huge memory

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,529
reductions coming in thanks to work by

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:11,100
Mark Martin we're going to be saved in

00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:13,829
20 30 megabytes on the plasma shell ok

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,660
it's identified more areas that we can

00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:18,600
get rid of if something we've identified

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:23,040
this is a problem are we going to slowly

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:27,149
taking out over time but 504 huge

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,189
improvement already and we're also

00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:31,709
getting rid of rosin valve super legacy

00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:33,559
code with luck indeed becoming more

00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:37,679
popular we can get rid of some of our

00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:39,749
more extreme the all software now that

00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,459
lovely isn't coming amor de facto

00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:45,269
standard that everyone's implementing it

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:47,850
even console kitty so by getting rid of

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:50,009
some of these older legacy software we

00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:54,449
get more maintain paths for everybody

00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:57,029
everyone gets a better experience and we

00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:59,999
fast herbs we're not going to query for

00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:02,790
all of these really old bucket so we're

00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,620
getting rid of old unused things which

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,700
is good forget

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,220
the fact as I caught it another thing

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,529
that came into 50 free which I'm quite

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,020
excited about is activity tracking

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:18,080
activity has been a part of plasma for a

00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,800
while but now we're really making use of

00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:25,310
it in something that I think is sensible

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,260
documents that's a legal documents with

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,240
keeping track of which document open her

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,029
activity using character to distrain

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,790
work it's not just a plain list we're

00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:36,560
keeping a log / activity and repute type

00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:38,990
of our luggage document is opened to

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,390
prioritize this list and one of our

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,029
menus you can right click on capes and

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,550
artistic or a recent documents with that

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:50,150
application so its application Pacific

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:52,520
and contact specific cells really again

00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,670
enhancing productivity because you're

00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,980
getting your documents faster and

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,050
contextually aware and the same is

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,120
happening for contacts so you chat with

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,010
someone a lot of you instant messaging

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,140
client they can now appear in your

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:09,230
launcher just your favorites you've got

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:11,690
quicker access to keep reuse talk to a

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,640
lot and because it's powered by okay

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,760
people framework you can start any

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,040
action sending an email or an attachment

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,870
and now something we've had coming in

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,540
from fight at feeble really start to

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:27,620
make use of now enhanced activity

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:30,020
tracking another thing kiosk is coming

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:34,640
back you can tell from our screenshot

00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:37,029
it's old cosmic 83 but hearing our

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:41,690
feedback from some of our bigger

00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:43,790
customers unit project team so clear

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,910
solves a problem now they've been

00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,800
identifying with in plasma is something

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,010
that we did well we have no framework

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,220
available but over time we've not really

00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,959
capitalize on that people aren't aware

00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,050
people aren't using it properly so we

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:04,520
need to drink up up in a big way and

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:07,270
make it slightly prettier we have a new

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,709
volume up for coming kmix work fine

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:12,319
vertically integrate with the show and

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:14,059
again I suppose productivity down all

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,579
you want to do is change an output when

00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:19,480
you watch a movie that's the goal once

00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:22,100
again stuff done we've redesigned it

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,290
Howard's been working on it and it's

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:29,120
awesome and that's hopefully coming in

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:31,340
the next partner release the video

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,320
visual design group I've been working on

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:38,000
a priest Liam to gtk so we can make all

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,640
the applications look the same a matter

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,200
what talking on so you should be from

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,900
plasma point of view we should work with

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,210
all applications it's plasmas job to

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,100
make all applications or cute

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,650
application for the same it's plasmas

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:56,330
job to make of our applications look the

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:59,120
same so the making gtk blend in visually

00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:02,240
and that's coming hopefully in 5.5

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,640
smiths the window 524 hopefully and 525

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,040
which is a good Christmas present we

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:13,549
should see gtk breeze themes and us both

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:15,830
gtk2 and gtk3 under visual design group

00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:18,020
haven't stopped there has been worked on

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,330
a lot of really really awesome mock-ups

00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:24,620
way to think or work getting excited

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:27,169
about them it's a numark up for system

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,809
Guard showing or you're running

00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:31,669
processes and this is a lover screenshot

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,500
it's a nice mixture of the usability

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,929
team and your graphic design team work

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,179
them together usability team identifying

00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,460
your reason your openness is to identify

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:43,790
which processes are running amok and

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,440
kill them not to give a list of

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,720
absolutely everything on your son a

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,790
mobile useful but that's not what users

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,970
are trying to do most of time so what

00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,010
I'd like and then the visual design team

00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,770
of turned us into

00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,510
it looks beautiful and hopefully over

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,840
the next release that people are excited

00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:06,160
and wanting to help implement this and I

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,680
really love these designs and again

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,100
system settings where they've been

00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:14,440
broken redesigns trying to find it

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,210
trying to make it easier to find the

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,160
settings you want a conference you're

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,830
looking for again enhancing your

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,930
productivity so because the new more

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,310
cough so work in progress hopefully

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:28,690
we'll see us in upcoming plasma releases

00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:33,940
so something to get excited about as

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:41,710
well so in conclusion I'm going to work

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:43,390
with and making Lee in conclusion plasma

00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,690
five is it a good state we did the

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:49,180
migration pretty well and we're only

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,970
going up from here we're not making

00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,010
steps backwards with just progress and

00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,940
I'm quite I'm genuinely excited about

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:59,470
where apparel or plasma and there's lots

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,390
of potential for improvement that we've

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,490
identified and we are currently work on

00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,890
both in the short term and in the long

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,200
term is seen in mock-ups they're really

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,480
cool and we need we need people here to

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,700
step up and get involved and it's a

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,520
really good time to get involved in

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:19,500
plasma motor hard work done a grunt work

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:24,240
now is fun stuff polishing and

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,240
implementing really really cool designs

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:30,000
and after we've done any questions

00:20:46,350 --> 00:21:10,690
are not you that's everything and it

00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:12,669
included a wide range of upward

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:18,879
recruiting duplicates however a number

00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:20,980
estrogen duplicates 2137 everything like

00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:23,200
before bed by cheque number folks it

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,779
generally is part of my bedtime routine

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,879
clima team grab my laptop climb into bed

00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:34,330
and then look for oil and confirmed bugs

00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:36,749
of plasma all day he's no wait what are

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:40,950
you doing with my bedroom intervention

00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:49,239
this is why we were out about marina

00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:52,239
what okay what's just what with the

00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:54,070
question what's his disorder I didn't

00:21:52,239 --> 00:22:01,259
notice any booking in the graph because

00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:05,850
I stole it from you internet comscore

00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,850
and that sound important it's got com

00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:13,360
it generally is an it was on a proper

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,590
article it wasn't just one bloke in the

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,389
top notch and evident proper statistical

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:21,340
company I can find you a little article

00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:33,730
and I'll send it to you after

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:36,039
presentation the next yeah any comment

00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:39,940
yet from there that's july two thousand

00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:42,190
thirteen on the left and then jun 2015

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:47,019
on the right australia graphically years

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:52,139
and next to use basically talking about

00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:52,139
that's gonna be the kids the next year

00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,159
yeah yeah definitely I mean I told this

00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:01,929
graph because it this source because

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,779
they had a lovely line graph there were

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:06,549
plenty of other sources where

00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:08,679
informations like different but it still

00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:10,840
show if anything a slightly positive

00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:13,029
trend it was born falsely founded showed

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,470
it doubled in the last two years again

00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:17,009
it depended on Harry collectors

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,009
information

00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:34,360
oh you wanted to talk like that nothing

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:37,780
are so very good question if you

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:42,340
maintain a stop slacking then maybe we

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:55,440
get someone I believe there's a talk

00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:58,830
tomorrow yeah just stupid title yeah

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,840
cool I have one more question and then

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:10,990
there's one can handle that's how I need

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:13,150
to question what does aashiqui stay

00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,520
bullish I mean we're seeing destroy

00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,530
start picking her up I don't was seeing

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,080
it in deployment very much yet I dunno

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:23,830
warm web company does not stretch to

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:32,230
plasma 5 which is with it one can the

00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:34,830
network tap so how is the two sports

00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,830
plaza

00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:42,150
yeah question so if any plasma for we

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,870
were in a transitive stage we've had it

00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,720
went through a few different

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:48,780
technologies within plasma for and yet

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,480
made it all work so depending on the

00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:55,740
plasmoid it might be difficult or harder

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:59,159
if it was written in C++ using a

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:02,280
graphics view API then you're talking

00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:06,000
from the visual part a completely light

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:09,840
from the logic part a bit of shifting

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,169
things about if it was written in qml ql

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,480
you can keep it one in its very trivial

00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:17,370
I am as warm I brought him which was

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,679
just minimal clock widget on your

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:23,240
desktop and I did not in an evening

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,240
while drunk so

00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:42,180
yes yes or no mostly yes from a visual

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,430
sign we're sticking with pml Kim elves

00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:48,090
are pretty much the only way to do p

00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:50,420
quick and we want none but that's also

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,530
good it means our documentation is

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:57,000
standardized and there is a wealth of

00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:59,100
resources on the internet for q no but

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,770
you can also plug in technology such as

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,440
HTML canvases so you still got a range

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,960
of technologies within this you can plug

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,270
in HTML canvases you can write your own

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,150
up yet more in JavaScript or you can

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:15,120
write at war in C++ to your logic side

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,620
the logic side you can still kind of get

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,650
away over the range of different

00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:22,800
languages you can why qml plugins in

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:25,530
simple plus and go there is a way to

00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,020
durham pi think but it's more complex

00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,580
and it's worth but we're going to see

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,530
our trained over time as more companies

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,840
pick up key quick because we're closer

00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:36,210
to cute now I think it's fair to say

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,910
we're closer to q2 as developments

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:43,370
happen now we benefit for free while

00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,370
we're doing arrangement follow

00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:06,030
we switch 24 months this time because if

00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,520
we did a three month cycle actual

00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:11,760
release would be on like tuesday or

00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,800
wednesday draw an academy and there was

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,710
a general consensus of we're not

00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:20,280
releasing during Academy because rule

00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,920
stressed with this work so we knew this

00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:25,950
we could have Academy whether we stick

00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:29,880
to it I don't know personal added extra

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:31,820
months it's swings around rocks so we're

00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:36,290
going to have a full discussion on that

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:47,370
when we plan our 5 dal 45 minutes ago

00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:53,570
okay the please anemic if i crack my

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:59,130
skating the time neway that were

00:27:53,570 --> 00:28:02,919
deliberately there was an punishing hey

00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:10,320
what are those I know

00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:10,320
I mean credit given the time

00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:25,929
learn from those of a name is definitely

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:28,210
done a good job of showing us what Ricky

00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:30,700
desktop kind of like it done some

00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:33,700
amazing work there but our works

00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:40,059
catching up in front of the five it's

00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:42,909
doing a really good job so yes a longer

00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:47,409
question and I wanted you get an awkward

00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:49,299
person in there moving towards being

00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:53,620
more mobile-friendly particular window

00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:56,200
side but also seeing we're seeing a

00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,960
backlash in terms of media which is bad

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,630
but we also seeing that the perishing in

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:07,080
our direction harlow putting that

00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:09,940
direction and that's relevant for us so

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,830
really is we don't want to stick to

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,179
being a copy of anything I don't think

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,740
we've ever been a copy of anything

00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:16,539
people just said that because we had a

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:19,299
menu on your bottom there's no had a

00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:21,610
menu on the top and then people identify

00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:24,610
at one common thing and then say don't

00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:26,260
the same so I don't think it over in a

00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,919
Windows clone and 11 will continue to

00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,919
hear windows lame

00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,550
