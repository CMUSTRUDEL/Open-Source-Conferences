Title: Jens Reuterberg - Smart Tech and Sensible Tech - Akademy 2015

Description: 
	One of the things that predated the skyscapers where the elevators. KDE has soaring skyscrapers but very few elevators. We need to value tech and apps not just for its features but for how accessible they are.

People often talk about "smart tech", technology and apps that are packed to the brim with features and details. Powerful tricks and gadgets but with all this focus on features we often ignore the need to make those features accessible. That's why I want to talk about "sensible tech" as a counter to "smart tech" - a design goal of looking as close as possible not just what the user would want but what the user wouldn't want. Without stripping the app of features.

I will talk about the recently set goal of "Simple by Default, Powerful When Needed" and why we need to look at how this is presented to the user and examples of where it is used.
