00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,010
to the trees fine because he's a

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,520
Vivekananda and you're going to learn a

00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:33,460
few tricks from yourself well thank you

00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,260
thank you and then before we start I

00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,110
have good news and bad news the good

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,000
news is that I don't have any slides and

00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,250
the bad news is that I'm going to do a

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,950
demo on

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,490
openSUSE sampled meat and just pray that

00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:51,730
everything works it doesn't just lately

00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:55,000
so let me say that I'm really happy to

00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:57,100
see so many people here because I'm

00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,170
competing with a very interesting topic

00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:05,049
the room and I thought that if I had

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,990
someone I could talk just a single

00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:09,850
person and consider it a success but I

00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:14,049
can see what basis I'm very happy to see

00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,900
so the original idea was to give a

00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:20,770
workshop where I started with explaining

00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:25,229
my personal graphic workflow and then

00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,229
dive into individual features

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:36,190
which I already have but since I only

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:39,350
have half an hour more or less around

00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:44,590
I'll show you some the features that I

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,590
find very interesting and very useful

00:01:51,830 --> 00:02:04,119
so this is my first personal favorite

00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:06,590
this so-called image quality search

00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,020
let's imagine a situation and that's

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,600
probably something pretty much all new

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,790
templates you went on vacation and

00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,870
interesting for the country you get back

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,870
home you have something like 3000 photos

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:25,790
some of them are negatively either

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:28,959
focused or so overexposed and then

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,820
described so you need to sort them out

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,769
so if you do this manually you can do

00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:39,080
that but it's like gardening with exists

00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:41,120
so dish family recently relatively

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,739
recently introduced a new feature called

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,290
image quality which allows you to

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:53,209
automate distance and this feature

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:59,000
allows you to sort out for either not

00:02:53,209 --> 00:03:00,840
focus on glory that no easy with a very

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,280
high inflation rate

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,830
so they some preparation artifacts and

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,650
so on the good thing about these

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,050
speeches that it doesn't do anything to

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,290
your products it just marks them as such

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:22,849
and Jesus really flags that are already

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,849
available in digital acceptance

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:31,170
[Music]

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:33,920
sorry consider fine and painting for

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,920
photostats

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,549
so instilling speaks Romanian feature so

00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,709
it's a bit of hidden amis sometimes in

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:50,670
the marks products that are perfectly

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:53,870
located as bad there for a variety of

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,920
reasons for example I forgot a lot of

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,190
contributors that have very rough

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,260
texture and it often happens that even

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,170
in image quality to the disorder

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,930
consider this is no support so but as I

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:14,850
said routine is that doesn't do anything

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:17,609
for us except it has some same defaults

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:20,930
which you can try I would suggest if you

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,930
want to try this

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,460
[Music]

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,430
[Music]

00:04:44,650 --> 00:05:26,060
there is a so let's say yeah it's

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,729
finished

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:34,520
and as you can see that it's actually

00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:37,130
pretty good at market models and see

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:43,090
what we have here for example this is

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:47,150
definitely something you can see

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:49,120
it was - painting me that's English 20

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:53,660
so he's not sure when it's good or bad

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:57,350
and once it's done that you can do the

00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:00,229
labels cycle to quickly locate the

00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:03,340
policy one more time if you want to find

00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:07,960
all the bottles that are considered good

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:13,699
youtube except eyes you'll see on the

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:16,430
occasion when you do see all the photos

00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:23,840
that are many people or maybe that you

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:29,590
can use to parties so this way very

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,590
quickly sort your collection and

00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:49,680
good so next region is geo-tagging how

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:54,629
many of you use Jeff I didn't even do

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:58,830
you geographers okay you really should

00:06:54,629 --> 00:07:02,060
because this is a really cool feature or

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:04,620
functionality actually started features

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,590
in time module that allows you to

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:12,599
generate foreign spy variety variety

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:17,340
ways for example say that once I took

00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:29,610
for school don't you and I want to

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:32,550
attack a massage so I go to this so this

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:36,080
opens a interface for genotype before

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,080
that we just design

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,360
so there are several things you can do

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:54,290
here first of all so this is the latest

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:57,320
with the German authorities to simply

00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:06,850
research like for example this this

00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:09,890
one's rotating somewhere chocolaty and

00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:12,980
excuse me the possible matches

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:16,730
so from here there are two ways that you

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:18,610
go I can either located marker on the

00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,080
map

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:25,460
fortunately unfortunately is for the

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:28,160
sovereignty Jew attacked so I can maybe

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:32,690
do my own map and they just drag the

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,520
photos on the map there are more

00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,480
convenient way of doing things is to

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:41,180
select all photos right click on the

00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:49,990
desired location and save and choose

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:55,150
moon selectivity it works Sun works and

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,150
yeah people who move to this position

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,660
another thing you can do if you are

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:05,420
really able to genotype is to have

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:09,460
children indication of your mobile

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:13,450
device recording tracks and gbx1

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,860
to get one and then use the Yellow Pages

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,140
anymore

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,920
indeed it down to two general attack

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,649
orders

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,490
this requires some education because you

00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:27,880
have to remember to see time mobile

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:31,720
device you can then have to remember to

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:36,070
activate tracking of a mobile device to

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:39,550
ensure that so that is only the first

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,610
but it's very nice to be able to Planet

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,270
Earth this way you can geotag hundreds

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:48,730
of thousand workers in one go

00:09:45,270 --> 00:10:04,830
my favorite thing waited year backwards

00:09:48,730 --> 00:10:04,830
is a little bit different with currency

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:41,380
so the nice thing about that let's hope

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:44,170
there are no compromising photos okay

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:47,050
this is the hardware to today the thing

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:49,270
is that the half ordinates the banding

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:52,000
in sex is a phone that is not understood

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,300
by the teacher so I want a very simple

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,370
battery that does

00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,580
it simply informants the coordinates X

00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:03,140
into T G compatible geofoam and

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,870
[Music]

00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,760
inspection mitigation so and don't hit

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:12,510
me on the head with a stick when a seed

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,240
grows I know we can see but it's only

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:18,630
three lines in the first one focus then

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:24,210
uses the concept of a keyboard and the

00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:27,420
TR - so we - Street one spaces and then

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,140
it uses multiple same thing in four

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,160
minutes

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:34,230
what is it what is that correct that

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,670
correctly formatted as agility power

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,460
back to the people

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:51,120
so this basically works something like

00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:58,110
this so as you can see there is

00:11:51,120 --> 00:12:01,710
litigation process and form it into the

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,590
keyboard and then all I have to do is to

00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:12,770
select the focus on J time and the

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:18,450
geotag want to right click and say paste

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:22,200
orders it's actually much faster and

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:26,210
easier than it sounds so you want to try

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:30,410
this road the street or if you want to

00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:38,660
these are the ruins your hospital the

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:41,140
conditional sit on the fence Genesis so

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,140
far so good

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,709
is it back soon

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,600
so there is another feature that I like

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:58,220
about I don't know about you but I like

00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:01,220
filters and I don't actually use digital

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:05,360
to create the others it's not feel this

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,890
is what more like presets I have my own

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,060
collection of the presets that a

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:15,740
particular item so let's see if we can

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:20,390
do something about these photos so let's

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:23,770
see I would like I would like to create

00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:28,700
a simple Rachel for my photos and

00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:32,450
easiest way to do that is to lower the

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:35,470
contrast I'm exaggerating easily so we

00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:40,300
can actually see something that's green

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:50,270
now let us introduce some color change

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:54,490
and let's adjust perverse okay I like

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:56,870
this very nice the problem is that

00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:00,709
dozens of other one sort of like our

00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:04,019
life is a picture so the idea of doing

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:10,709
this for every single water is not exact

00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:12,930
so what I can do I can use a new feature

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:16,079
in digital that support so-called

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,660
come back into tables these are

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,019
basically product of tables for tables

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:24,990
that allow the application to perform

00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:27,720
cultural formation and it's actually

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:32,160
very easy to use because it's supported

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:38,130
by the convert zoom in image magic

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:43,190
so if ingredients premises of the line

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:50,100
and this one gives you this very nice

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:54,050
triple-t table what you do then you can

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,050
disable into digipan

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,640
opening for anything but my old exact

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,200
effects and intelligence were mentioning

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:16,760
ones like I showed you reduce contrast

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:20,030
the interview scholarship dinner just

00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:23,930
works and then you save this file and

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:28,610
move it into location where digital has

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:34,600
all its blacks the tables and what you

00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:34,600
get is when you are important for energy

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:52,220
liberated belong to effect skeletons you

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:56,540
will actually see your effects in the

00:15:52,220 --> 00:16:00,860
list of the presets like - and my

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:04,790
presets ritual tastic accommodating the

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:09,250
location and then is there so this way

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,250
applying effects is just a natural

00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,380
[Music]

00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:32,690
yes so these are these are presets this

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:34,910
is the one I added myself so this one

00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:38,090
you can have as many presets as you like

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:41,620
and the recipient remaining operation or

00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:48,740
any cognitive deterioration answer and

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:51,050
save it as a preset and finally this is

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,800
a little bit I don't know whether you

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:58,490
need but I sort of like to play it's a

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:02,000
data as you may or may not know digital

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:06,050
saves everything in disabilities to live

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,480
database and good thing is that you can

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:15,890
extract this data analyzes and for

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:19,100
example a new set of digital papers then

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:22,339
sometimes I like to know which camera to

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:27,069
actually use most maybe I should sell

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,069
hundreds so I created a simple

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,030
similar

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,940
that does for me

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:51,269
so I need to do is go right past my path

00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,529
then I can use a parameter this piece of

00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:56,330
work super Angeles

00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:59,370
what is hammers and this one mentions

00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:03,919
the cameras are used in how many times a

00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:07,559
twister I hope you can see the text and

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:12,750
the good thing is that it also imports

00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:14,669
the data in the concentrated as a comma

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,330
separated file so you've been easily

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:21,720
important to me in a spreadsheet

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:26,279
application if you're into it you can

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:28,529
development nice-looking crops and you

00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,929
can do the same with limiters which can

00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:34,529
be useful if you have several lenses or

00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:39,629
your plans violence anything what is

00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:42,629
actually my favorite popular which which

00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:46,379
camera which lens to actually use which

00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:48,419
populace is my favorite like for example

00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:52,320
I have a suit lens and applied to the

00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:56,630
distance from the lens and I need to

00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:00,300
figure out ok do any 15

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:06,780
it's fine they won so I can just on the

00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:14,850
street with a lattice parameter then

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:20,970
this gives me all the lenses so the

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:25,250
spirit self is very simple this is

00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:29,340
aluminum is just the function if then

00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:33,360
statements with some Israel requires

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:39,770
queries and you can extend manual ones

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:59,580
and you can take a look at their English

00:19:39,770 --> 00:20:02,540
so I suggest that let's let's move

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,800
questions because it's supposed to be a

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,860
dialogue why I would like to make it

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,940
dialogue I would like to be your family

00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:14,420
if you have the tips and tricks system

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,420
so please go ahead

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:31,700
okay and if I have some more time then I

00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:34,820
will introduce it to my own workflow

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:38,450
I've been using Gigi fountain as my

00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:42,760
primary and actually my only water

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:45,980
management application since 2010 so

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,660
pretty much in seventeen seventy years

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,650
I've been obsessively developing my own

00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:54,650
workflow and I don't know whether I

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:56,990
should be proud of you talk matters in

00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,600
the fact that we used so much Manolis

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:09,230
but it's actually pretty simple

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:27,080
I've used for everything from the first

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:29,480
thing I do I so the important allows you

00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,780
to rename for us in variety of ways like

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,140
for example I prefer to rename my photo

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,730
by date time so I can immediately see if

00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,600
you take a look at my collection even

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:45,440
immediately immediately see that when

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:53,480
the corner take so this one was due by

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:55,700
June 2017 and to do that you can simply

00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,910
use the rename a change in work and the

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,220
advantage of this

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,980
assume that your imports did you come to

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,740
us at a time to joke mean it's just that

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,420
we need more courts automatic and it

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,450
works very simple and there is another

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:13,030
feature that's using the same

00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:17,470
functionality these are getting so

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:20,170
amazingly choose digit time as option

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,450
then you select whatever format you like

00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:26,470
you can even select the custom performer

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:40,990
and this is phi0 I prefer to name like

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:51,730
year and actually you can already see

00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:52,210
that they're inside so when you did you

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,640
go

00:22:52,210 --> 00:23:00,610
so the second thing is timing and

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:05,650
flagging codes so I use this last two to

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:06,160
tank so I can really see what what I was

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,690
doing

00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,510
for example photos that I immediately

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:13,660
like and I think that physically limited

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,730
shots I've used the green flag to my

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,560
apartment if I'm not sure that the

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,470
products moved are bad leadership

00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:23,230
courses later than use yellow finals

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,990
I just immediately discarded for a

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,280
second life so there is no

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:32,370
and that's next thing I do and this is

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,310
also very new to beach if you shoot in

00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:38,810
both bandage it

00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:42,630
as you can see from this screen I have

00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:46,710
boobies of every form that's because I

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:50,580
have both profiles J pairs so - welcome

00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:54,690
to the JPEGs you can choose a filter for

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:58,640
my filter and say okay I would like to

00:23:54,690 --> 00:24:05,310
see one day a week files automatically

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:12,320
highest and then process the bonus and

00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:12,320
what I do at the end I stack them so

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:24,360
some of each stack contains both Jane

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:26,400
and the process for this is my personal

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,820
approach and I started using it way

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,580
before digital introduce versioning so

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:35,280
there is the new person did you can

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:39,630
allows you to do all that automatically

00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:41,160
using the version the functionality but

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,880
the problem with this approach is that

00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:47,400
when you use version you can end up with

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:50,100
multiple files for each folder and if

00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,930
you do something outside regionally

00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:58,020
defaults that will be important because

00:24:51,930 --> 00:25:03,450
you can't easily readable files that may

00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:08,750
or may not have that so one of the less

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,750
I can use very social

00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:18,870
to filter them the thing is I don't

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:22,380
perform a song that's very fond of

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:23,970
signals because digital does this for me

00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,910
the Dishman has all the features you

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,880
need to find and fill different forums

00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:36,770
so theoretically that's how I do I just

00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:36,770
found everything in one and I just use

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:49,260
like for example the Lake Park sidewalk

00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:51,390
contains the dates section and he did

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:59,840
you come what much it shows you all the

00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:59,840
problems neatly organized by date so I

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:17,130
can use the timeline section which is

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,610
just another way of showing my first but

00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:25,830
they are presented at this very nice

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:28,950
parts and what response means that see

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,260
this mrs. main this is a pepper in the

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:33,870
electronics

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:37,950
so that's when I have to come for us and

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:40,049
the size of the bar the e type indicates

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,840
how many quarters there so apparently

00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:46,110
according to these degrees I took most

00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:49,889
pharmacies me and I'm going to infect me

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:52,260
see the regulators and anywhere you talk

00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:54,659
to me the back so that you attacking and

00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:59,159
here is a little thing let's say you

00:26:54,659 --> 00:27:03,870
want to see all your rumors about your

00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:07,769
trip to Paris you can do the map search

00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:12,240
interface and you can just do on the

00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:16,470
photos you like or you can draw a

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,230
rectangle around the diameter well which

00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:22,230
you would like to do indeed you know I

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:25,080
don't know we see this that I draw eyes

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:31,169
in the region and it shows all the

00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:38,120
points in this region so that's pretty

00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:41,120
much my work clothes so if you have any

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,120
questions

00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,470
[Music]

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,980
hey-ya

00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:01,600
no because I know that there is a

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:08,230
volunteer doing the packaging for

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:12,299
Windows and his videos so as far as I

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:16,480
know he's pretty productive eight I mean

00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:18,400
he releases Windows installers like

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,520
maybe two or three days our official

00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:24,460
religion teacher by the way I don't know

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:28,899
if you know that starting with version

00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:32,500
5.5 the discount available as a pH

00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:36,240
package so we go you see that you can

00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:39,319
try the new version without astronomy

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,319
[Music]

00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:48,799
and that's very nice speech to be chosen

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:53,580
a very nice thing to have to be able

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:56,190
without astronomy the downside is a

00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:59,700
little bit slow and start because us the

00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:07,230
middle told me it does it's a virtual

00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:09,770
system and that next time but yeah it's

00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,770
very nice

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:36,010
mission it works sitting Marquez

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,500
experimental and it has been

00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:47,110
experimental for the last probably three

00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:50,169
or five years works but it could lead to

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:55,090
some funny results like especially if

00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:57,490
you have images of animals it will mark

00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:01,600
and one might recognize them as people

00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:04,350
and he teaches animals any girlfriend in

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:09,700
the same album that would be very

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:13,320
undesirable results but yeah it works it

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,320
works but it's not perfect

00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:30,290
and yeah I know a long time but the good

00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:36,100
news is that there is support right

00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:36,100
after that so okay

00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,580
[Music]

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,580
