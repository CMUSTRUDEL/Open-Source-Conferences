Title: Mirko Boehm - Why We Fight - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	A review of the governance norms applied in FSFE, KDE and Wikimedia, how they developed over time and how current debates reflect their evolution.

FLOSS communities create free software products in a social
process. Communities with a small number of participants typically organise informally. As the community grows, the need for coordination grows as well and at some point formal organisation is required. Where structure and processes emerge, the principles and norms applied typically reflect voluntary participation and meritocratic peer status. The main interest of the community is to attract and retain contributors and to collect contributions. Based in a qualitative study performed at TU Berlin, the presentation will review the governance norms applied by the FSFE, the KDE Community and Wikimedia as the organisations developed, how the constitutions of the communities reflect the convictions and expectations of their contributors, and how the need to evolve governance norms is at the heart of recent conflicts in all three communities.

thank you well thanks thanks everybody

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,369
for coming back from your lunch break or

00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:21,119
coffee break and thanks for having the

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,189
patience to listen to a completely

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,559
different topic really then the plasma

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,829
announcements class my announcements are

00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,119
very hands-on like you can you will have

00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,620
a feeling for what does this give me

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,360
this is great this presentation will be

00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,370
slightly different because what this may

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,920
gain us is what rather indirect it's

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,340
about the question how we run our

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,390
communities most of you know me is

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,550
anything anybody in a room who doesn't

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:54,390
know me right so we'll skip the

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:58,110
introductions mainly we had some

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,780
conflicts recently in the last couple of

00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,960
months and we may have the impression

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,640
that we as KD are special and if you

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,570
involved in multiple communities that

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,359
are at the same magnitude as K years we

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,950
realize no we're not that special so for

00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:20,609
example we had this write a discussion

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:24,179
about KT vision on the private KETV

00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:26,700
mailing list that created 350 mailing us

00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:29,969
postings 50% of the traffic for half a

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,990
year it wasn't a very pleasant

00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:35,969
conversation it revealed a pretty strong

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,079
disconnect between the inner circle and

00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:42,119
ee-vie and the rest of the community and

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,649
that you might have the impression that

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,810
this was a very special thing that only

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,420
happens in KDE right by the way first

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,340
first raise of hands who here is not on

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,459
the evlist

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,840
was not an Eevee member all right that's

00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,279
not good because I'm preaching to the

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,670
choir here and I'm actually wanted to

00:01:56,279 --> 00:02:02,579
preach to the other choir so still carry

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,079
on listen to me here's another example a

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,300
debate in the Free Software Foundation

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,800
Europe completely different community

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:15,980
fsfe wants to adopt a code of conduct

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,980
and started discussing this in May 2016

00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:19,930
people worked on it so proposed the

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,989
draft

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,280
and it got ignored ignored as and you

00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,900
know what what happens if you propose

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,569
something people don't really want it

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,189
they just silently give them silent

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,200
treatment right so nobody really went

00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:35,470
and start discussing the code of conduct

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,480
until April where in April somebody said

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,510
well you have had enough time to read

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,069
this why don't you actually state your

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,230
opinion on it and be adopted that

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:46,870
triggered a mailing list storm of two

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,780
and emails in two weeks which led to a

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,890
complete shutdown of the organization

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,540
people yelling at each other

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,959
complete indecision the code of conduct

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,389
is still not adopted so if you think we

00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,700
have this problem nobody else has nope

00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:03,069
actually I think these problems that we

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,970
see with their own governance are quite

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:07,989
common so this triggered a study where

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,030
he said let's look at three different

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:12,129
communities that are all volunteer if an

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,349
order to flip a caller to see mature and

00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:17,769
see how they developed the governance

00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:19,120
norms and how they apply them today and

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,920
this is what I did basically since last

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,760
year April since the thing in fsfe

00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,169
happened this was the final straw dead

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,299
so we did some Theory today what does an

00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,069
open source community in and the

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:31,810
understanding of this paper we make a

00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:34,569
strong differentiation between people

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,099
that produce or open source and people

00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:38,889
that produce something in an openly

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,569
governed way so if you can look at

00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,190
Google producing Android that's not an

00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,629
open source community that might be

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,340
known to us product but it's not known

00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:47,319
source community and all governance

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,260
problems are Google's internal problems

00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,669
because you can't really participate our

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,440
definition that we apply here is we

00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:56,560
produce common goods because that's what

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,239
freely licensed software is in a process

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,030
that is based on voluntary participation

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,620
that doesn't mean only volunteers it

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,790
could be companies participating

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,970
voluntarily but it's still an open

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,940
process in this report that we're

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:12,760
looking at here we looked at volunteer

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:16,500
driven communities volunteer driven

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,639
means mainly driven by amateurs is a

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,799
theoretical distinction between amateurs

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,240
and professionals and this this doesn't

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,330
mean you don't know what you're doing it

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,099
just means that what you're doing is not

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,690
what you make your living with your main

00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,370
income what a professional is a

00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,520
professional photographer is a person

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,760
that shoots great pictures for money a

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,260
amateur for

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,690
referre shoots the same great pictures

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,880
for fun right that's difference between

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,320
amateur and professional and that's why

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,850
we look at volunteer of communities and

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,460
interesting leader aren't that many

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,750
large volunteers etc so we are get

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,610
communities that are mature and compared

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,410
to be large and of course there are

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,790
successful because you only get to this

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,740
point where you start to argue about

00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,250
governance and how do you coordinate 300

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,570
or 400 people when you're successful

00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,980
this wien arrows the field by the way

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,580
they're not there are not that many of

00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,580
these communities

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,920
what makes large communities special

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,390
first of all when we begin with smaller

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,460
communities we all kind of work together

00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,190
if there's any conflict we just discuss

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,020
it we have a little like in endless

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,550
debates but things just get discussed

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,890
and you know the ten people involved and

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,750
if all else fails you discuss a bit more

00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,360
and 100 ones near you have a conference

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,620
where you get to work out the things

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,080
that you couldn't agree on so far it's

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,610
all very organic right the organization

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,650
gets bigger than you have specialization

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,140
which means people focus on different

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:39,070
things division of labor in the

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,420
classical sense and that means you don't

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,160
really have a need for governance when

00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,870
you have a very small group you have a

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,210
need for governance later when you have

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,710
a larger group that has a diverse set of

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,850
volunteers that come from different

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,800
backgrounds through different

00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,380
expectations maybe with different levels

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,240
of experience and then you need

00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,060
governance basically to coordinate the

00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,500
work of this large group there's another

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,830
perspective on this and this is the

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:07,630
outside view this is how does the

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:11,170
community interact with you know its

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,730
users and its competitors etc and there

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,950
the need for governance comes from the

00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,720
fact that we have a lot of fluctuation

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,700
of contributors and that we need to

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,490
maintain the user base of the community

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:26,470
to be able to grow contributors and that

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,810
basic issues should steer our actions in

00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,400
terms of what is it that we produce

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,260
cousin from the outside perspective

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,330
people don't look at how do you run your

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,560
community on the outside perspective

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,640
people look at what do you produce what

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,430
do you get me right

00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,990
you download Firefox from the Firefox

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,550
movie because you want to use it not

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,670
because the files good Firefox community

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,080
has a great code of conduct right

00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,820
similarly even when people look at the

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,560
KDE community the first interaction that

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,840
they have with us is with the products

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,290
that we create but that we need to

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,590
translate that to how do we recruit

00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:01,870
contributors from that process more than

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,480
the people that naturally fade away from

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:08,260
the community over time so a positive

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,540
sum game by the way this talk is

00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,100
normally not thirty minutes so I'm going

00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,990
to race through a lot of things and if

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,660
you have questions take some notes and

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,520
we'll try to answer them there's the

00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:23,440
theory of the behavior of social groups

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,300
that I did not invent there's this

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,450
Olson's theory of collective action and

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,560
one of the things that it's a classic

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,910
that he put out there is that groups

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,180
behave differently depending on their

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,310
size a small group typically has a

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,260
situation where your individual

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,550
interests of joining a group and the

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,230
overall goals of the group are pretty

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,450
much identical because he just formed a

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,280
group there has been no time to deviate

00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,050
between what you want to achieve and

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,940
what the group wants to achieve this is

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,130
how we all started small Park for open

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,310
source projects right first days and

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:58,270
Katy were like that too you go to a

00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,550
state where you have say between 20 and

00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,250
50 contributors like a medium-sized

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,710
group you still know everybody is pretty

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,930
much all of them are your friends or

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,670
close to be like close to you if there's

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,260
any conflict this is the situation where

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,080
you know a lot there's a bit of debate

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,940
you meet people you work it out in the

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,100
end it's all consensus driven because

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,520
you can you can reach consensus with

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:26,130
this a group of this size now things get

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:30,280
a key when you reach your later stage

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,930
chosen by the way studied unions workers

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,670
unions and it was the same thing there

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,910
when you reach a later stage where the

00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:39,700
group smarts goes beyond say 50 and this

00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:42,040
kind of ad hoc coordination completely

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,780
breaks down that allows you to based on

00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:48,460
trust and common interests get to

00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:50,920
agreements then you see for example

00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,550
people using positions in the group for

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,500
their own advantage or you see people

00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:59,180
join in group for prestige right and

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,190
this is where governance norms normally

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,540
because all of a sudden you're not you

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,250
can't rely anymore on the fact that

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,890
everybody is on the same page on

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,930
everything and of course the communities

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,760
that we look at here with multiple

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:14,900
hundreds of contributors are in this

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,910
stage an interesting aspect here is

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,940
community composition community

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:22,510
composition is basically the the makeup

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,850
of your community based on three

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:32,170
constituencies which is volunteers staff

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:32,170
hired people and businesses involved we

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:41,060
we do assume that the social norms that

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,860
develop in the community depend on

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,840
community composition you can imagine a

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,690
group of volunteers behaving differently

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,820
then a community that is completely made

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,890
up of businesses that cooperate right

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,050
the governance normals will be different

00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,910
for example businesses are way more used

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,150
to setting up contractual frameworks to

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,860
how to work they work together

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,150
sorry so many of the issues that we run

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,610
into where we have to kind of make up

00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:06,940
our own rules will be much more clear

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,990
for them and they're more used to

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,210
specifying their interests why do we

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,580
cooperate upfront if you have staff in

00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:16,100
your organization staffs main interest

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,680
is a secure job in a non time paycheck

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,230
right so volunteers versus staff is

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,730
another issue as I said in this report

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,980
we're looking mainly at organizations

00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,700
that at the parts of organizations that

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,490
are made up of volunteers another thing

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,570
here that we need to separate is open

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,510
source products versus community

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,980
processes or we sometimes throw these

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,660
things together and consider them the

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,310
same thing like open source communities

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,560
produce open source products in an

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,060
openly governed way as I already said

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,300
this isn't necessarily the same thing

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,430
these two things are really orthogonal

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,100
however we see of course a preference

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:54,190
for for open governance for transparent

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,220
and collaborative governance in

00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:00,220
community driven communities that are

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,600
volunteer driven right so the more

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,390
individuals you have who join your

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,460
organization out of their own motivation

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,190
and that expect to be treated as equals

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,210
in the organization the more preference

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,210
for for openness you have

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:18,360
this issue of warmth or participation

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:22,079
makes a lot of things complicated and

00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,459
also a lot of things easy we we say our

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,199
volunteers here are people here in the

00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:27,360
KDE community are all here out of their

00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:29,730
own motivation sure they may have an

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,660
employer right that tells them to work

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,519
on our software sure this is AG a

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,110
special case even the employer has a

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,800
choice to do this or not to this it's

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,329
still voluntary participation and that

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,649
leads to an interesting question about

00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:48,660
Authority and and this is one of the key

00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:52,470
issues that the KT community is strong

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,209
linguist formed a 1 right businesses

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,250
have a very clear defined Authority

00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:59,430
businesses have investors who owned a

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,230
business and these investors say what

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:04,800
the business is about what it's for why

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,329
it exists right governmental

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
institutions your tax authority they

00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,220
don't have a question of like why are we

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,519
here

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,529
right there are only two entities next

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,769
to churches they're two entities that

00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:18,569
are that can have to answer to this

00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,940
question from the inside sovereign

00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:22,589
states and open-source communities or

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,779
volunteer organizations because

00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:26,430
organizations only exist to further the

00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,980
interests of the people that engage in

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:31,260
them there's no outside authority right

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,920
which leads us to pick leaders say that

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,690
means we don't want Authority the other

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,420
side of the medal is we are our own

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,420
highest authority at the same time so

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:48,360
this basically defines the rules that we

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,940
apply to governance and the two

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,649
underlying pillars if you will are

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,649
voluntary participation of meritocracy

00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:57,240
out of this question like the only way

00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,800
that you gain authority within the

00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,569
community or the committee as a whole is

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,579
through contributions so what did we do

00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:07,260
with it basically did a qualitative

00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,430
embedded multiple case study if you're

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,779
interested in these scientific terms

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,010
reasons for you approach first of all

00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,560
there are very few communities that

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:19,560
match the criteria that I named mature

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,269
large volunteer but this means that the

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,430
studies interpretive you will not find

00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:25,260
simple answers like 40% if the

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,120
communities do this because

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,570
you also don't really mean anything but

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,710
you find a lot of insights from

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,770
contributors in these communities

00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,570
overall it's based on about 36 also into

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,700
recoil interviews and people that were

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,320
interviewed have more than 200 years of

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,430
contribute experience so you can assume

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,010
that there's some wisdom behind that the

00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,870
study consists of two parts the first

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,330
part looks at the individual

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,890
contributors perspective like why do you

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:59,250
engage in this what do you expect from

00:13:52,890 --> 00:14:02,910
the community and five things came out

00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,590
that I want to mention so we asked why

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,290
do you spend 10 years of your time or

00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:14,460
your spare time contributing to open

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:18,690
source what motivates you etc so one

00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:21,000
thing they said is I didn't join the

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,640
community for its governance norms

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,320
nobody said that it's not a single

00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,750
person in the whole set of interviews it

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,310
said those communities are so nice and

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,010
openly governed that's why I joined them

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,110
then I look for what to do no they came

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,620
for where they wanted to contribute

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:39,420
scratchy ownage sometimes it's called so

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,790
basically the participants come to

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:46,950
contribute to a community's product or

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:48,930
products for this to be motivating the

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,700
it needs to be an actual positive

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,150
creative challenge just maintaining

00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,130
something over time is not motivating

00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,900
which means that if you translate this

00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,330
into what should our communities do its

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,680
make sure we have these challenges and

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,420
they're well defined in a communicator

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,750
because that invites people to join our

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,100
community and participate growing to be

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,160
a part of the social group becomes

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,450
important over time that's a stadium you

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,610
come for the technology stay for the

00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,200
people approach right first people come

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,850
to join and contribute to your product

00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,230
then they realize what is this a really

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,570
nice group of people the various

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:27,090
friendly open inviting etc and then they

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:29,580
stay and mostly they say that they stay

00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:32,270
and they become they shift a part of the

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,490
time that they invest towards community

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:37,050
tasks because to commute his mission was

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,880
worth fighting for and the community's

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,920
vision is something like this Prima

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,230
like what Katy has formulated like we

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,270
want to ensure that users have control

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,480
over the data that they work with every

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:50,820
day we want to make sure free software's

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,300
accepted in a political sphere things

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,620
like that

00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,300
we want to make all the knowledge in the

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,850
world available to everybody in an open

00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:59,100
way right this is a mission or a vision

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,470
that is that gauges people that

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,180
encourages people to to contribute and

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,270
everybody said and I don't think that's

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,370
a surprise the most limiting factor to

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,810
own contributions is time right you have

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:12,120
time available and you spent this

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,100
between your different activities one is

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,510
probably family friends etc and other

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:20,100
one is open source contributions and

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:21,630
also if you shift your attention from

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,310
one project to another the other project

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,050
gets less attention because you can't

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,910
make more time so if you have 20 hours

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,480
available per week then you're shifting

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:33,510
between projects part one second part

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,520
here is I asked a lot about what are the

00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,790
what is the expectation towards your own

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:43,860
standing in the community and the

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:46,200
expectation that people have is not that

00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,660
everybody has the same rights it's more

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,610
than everybody's has the the optional

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,310
opportunity to achieve the same thing if

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,660
they invest the same amount of effort

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:58,080
right this is kind of what meritocracy

00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,270
translates to if you will if I spend 20

00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,040
hours every week I should be sort of as

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,900
much married as another person it spends

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,880
20 hours a week and somebody who only

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,430
occasionally comes in should still be

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,810
heard should be a valid valuable

00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:16,589
contributor but should not have the same

00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:19,079
merit as me this means that the need for

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,819
more than grassroots coordination only

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,360
occurs later when you have more

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,520
contributors when the group's grow they

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,670
split up into subgroups pretty much all

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,140
of the committees do now that have been

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,320
described in two interviews as little

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,730
villages with chieftains to maintain a

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,200
sense of productivity but also to

00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,060
maintain the size of the peer group that

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,100
you have to coordinate with this is a

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,410
chance to keep this like ad-hoc

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,580
coordination going it's also a

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,860
difficulty because you still have to

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,600
make sure the classical integration

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,460
problem in production is if you have

00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,880
multiple parts they need to be to get a

00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,039
combined to a whole

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,080
and it means you still have to mend

00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:59,710
itself to coordinate between the top

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,240
groups and people mentioned that the

00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,490
country the opportunities to contribute

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,710
initiate that they see should match

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,570
their own ethical convictions so things

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,669
like this should be a free software

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,929
product were like a hygiene factor a

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:12,610
site condition people don't even

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:18,370
consider joining something that doesn't

00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:20,919
have that communities that are diverse

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,510
that are treating everybody as equal

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,600
independent of what they look like or

00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:29,169
etc this is a site condition things that

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,350
people expect to be there right quite

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:34,900
interesting so that is it you can't put

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,880
a measure on diversity and say do we

00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,470
need to be 40 percent diverse and then

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,299
it's acceptable to you know the

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:42,490
expectation is that we treat everybody

00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:44,380
the same that's it but if you don't do

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,650
that if you do just a little bit you

00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,630
won't gain contributors here's a really

00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:53,710
interesting fact and this is where I

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:55,870
would like you to pay some attention as

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,460
I said initially people join because

00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,809
they want to positively contribute to

00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,830
communities products they consider

00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:04,179
themselves makers right over time the

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,250
communities become something like a

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:10,230
virtual home people develop friendships

00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:11,950
they develop a long-standing

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,230
relationships with people they work with

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:18,190
some describe it even as like a virtual

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,659
online family which means that being a

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,809
member of the community becomes a goal

00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:26,650
in itself originally you try to

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:28,330
contribute a product and then it becomes

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,909
important to you that you're also part

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,919
of the community so first of all we see

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:34,390
differentiation between makers and

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:35,950
community builders people that focus

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,210
more on contributing to the product and

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,400
people that focus more on how the

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,940
community works we've already seen

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:46,390
yesterday right this is a dilemma for

00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:48,340
community leaders your merit and your

00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,919
organization depends on your standing as

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,890
a contributor if you start shifting your

00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:57,280
activities towards being a community

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,559
builder you're not gaining merit now you

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,809
can say of course you may but how many

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,380
treasurers of kdv are still active

00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:10,409
contributors to the product

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:13,679
I'm one of them one thing okay in the

00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:16,110
worst case the administrative entities

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,259
that we built grow to be counterparts of

00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:22,409
the communities to do makers and the

00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:24,750
organization's diverged KDE and KDE v is

00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:27,059
not the worst example and this right

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,649
we're doing all right right and the

00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,000
reason why I say this here is that we

00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:31,529
realized okay we should maintain this

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,990
properly this balance that we have

00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:39,629
others are worse the people in interview

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:42,480
said that they would like tech community

00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:46,409
to be an ambitious productive

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,210
meritocracy of equals so people develop

00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:49,799
pretty strong loyalty there's a theory

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,240
about exit voice and loyalty if you want

00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:53,460
to meet it up it's quite interesting it

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,240
also explains your if you still cling on

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,320
to a bad relationship so worth reading

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,299
so example how many times have you

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:06,120
attended a Katy Academy more than five

00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:08,879
times more than eight many me what and

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,460
10 yeah that's the loyalty I'm talking

00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:13,529
about what people expect as a welcoming

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,289
inviting culture meritocracy there

00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:18,149
multiple angles towards meritocracy that

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:20,700
I've made a fifth time I can explain

00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:23,759
that as I said equality of opportunity

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,409
and they want a communities to be useful

00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:29,190
and productive because to me communities

00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:31,259
are a tool for them to that enables them

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,269
to be contributors if the community is

00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:35,279
take up 80% of your time with endless

00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:38,240
discussions and bike sharing they're not

00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:41,070
fulfilling their purpose anymore right

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,809
and the efficacy Ness is this idea of

00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,330
like the the thing that we strive for

00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:49,049
should be a game changer like make the

00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:50,700
world a better place final question we

00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:53,639
asked you is what our ethical principles

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,129
that you apply to your personal life are

00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:57,960
ready to you that you consider important

00:21:56,129 --> 00:22:02,370
to you and that you also want to see the

00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,720
community of implement the answers here

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,779
were a bit surprising us they're not as

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,460
principled as not as fundamental as you

00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:10,769
would think

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,210
so there's this idea that actions over

00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:15,179
words like people should contribute

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:18,059
working code something that is useful to

00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,240
the community people that only take part

00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,720
in

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,890
debates they just not so appreciated a

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,440
community should focus on the people

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,150
that do working code meritocracy here

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,780
again and this is the other perspective

00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:32,970
um people expect to be treated with

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,100
meritocracy but they also want the

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:38,190
communities to implement meritocracy in

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,320
that those who invest the most time the

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,950
most effort etc should become the

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,809
community leaders this is an interesting

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,550
aspect as well because it means that

00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:49,620
people that don't invest as much time

00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,420
anymore also need to make way for others

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,120
that still do or have come up as new

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:58,350
contributors solidarity is one thing

00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:00,630
there's a lot of talk about we basically

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,100
expect well-meaning even if people have

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,809
difficulties explaining themselves in

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,059
the polite way we had a lot of these

00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:07,500
discussions right but somebody had

00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:09,000
something real meaning to say what were

00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,490
well thought-out to say but it was said

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,990
in a not very well-meaning way but still

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,900
people should expect that this is a

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,460
valid contribution and transparency

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:24,540
transparency is an interesting thing

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:26,630
that it's similar to the product being

00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,230
under a real open-source license

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,100
transparency enables people to

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:34,410
contribute you cannot contribute as

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:36,390
affect as effectively as you potential

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,730
is if you don't know what everything

00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,410
that goes on in the community right the

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:43,440
community needs to proactively make

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,179
McNown what it's working on to invite

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,530
people to contribute to it we do this

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:51,300
quite well for our product processes so

00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,640
second part of this thing was then that

00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,800
we looked at three communities KT

00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,020
community fsfe in the German chapter of

00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:02,760
the commedia who all matched these

00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:05,580
criteria and and that analyzed them for

00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,770
five different criteria why are they

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,360
there how are they organized how do they

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,980
make decisions in to resolve conflicts

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,020
how do they find their community

00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,760
membership and what kind of structural

00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,910
reform is in outlook etc are they going

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,559
through I will go through this part

00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,300
really quickly because I only have a few

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,520
minutes left and I want to get to the

00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,440
the end this will be a paper is already

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,690
like 30 pages and it will be published

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,809
second half of this year so you get to

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,160
read this up in detail fsfe is a lobby

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:34,650
for source

00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,930
it basically represents the source

00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,610
community at the political level and it

00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,650
combines community representation

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:43,050
political influence and legal expertise

00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:48,270
it's legal structure interestingly is as

00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:51,210
we are an Eevee charitable well but let

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,800
by a General Assembly however it has

00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,870
very influential and formal structure

00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,580
those people speak of luminaries people

00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,400
that have been very influential in the

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,890
past and still kind of call the shots

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,690
and the norms and processes in the

00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,810
organization are very under documented

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,310
there is a consensus survey of debate to

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,080
fall back to the the president of the

00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:12,300
organization of a decision can't be made

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,370
there's a strong sensitivity towards

00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,700
minority opinions as in we don't

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:20,160
overrule somebody if we have a tight

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,870
decision like a 55 where's this 25%

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,340
decision then we don't make a decision

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:28,200
because we don't want to alienate the

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:29,550
other 45% there are no real defined

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,650
rules of how to appeal against the

00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,960
decision um which is interesting because

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:36,600
fsfe is technically organized all over

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,950
Europe and there are many old norms they

00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,330
are present they're not very well

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:44,790
understood and this makes organizational

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:46,110
change very very difficult the community

00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:47,970
membership in the organization is very

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:51,600
selective it's basically invite-only

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,950
and there's only one point of membership

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,710
which is a member of the General

00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:57,720
Assembly there is no real path for

00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,970
contributors to assent to this which

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,460
leads to a disconnect between the the

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,260
central office in Berlin and its Free

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,360
Software Foundation Europe right or do

00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:11,040
you regional organization in different

00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,540
countries very short similar kte I don't

00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,620
need to explain this really because we

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,240
are here in KDE so KD evey again a

00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,750
charitable minimal form a structure

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,690
meritocratic averse to Authority it has

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,780
a manifest and a coded conduct in place

00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:29,280
the decision-making is consensus driven

00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,770
with almost no community level decisions

00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,810
and we shy away from any kinds of form

00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,110
the votes we have a community working

00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:38,010
group that moderates on community norms

00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:40,350
beyond that we don't really have

00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,730
conflict resolution indecision is quite

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,700
common and we have undefined rules of

00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,630
appeal community membership we have an

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,520
open-door policy

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:49,770
new comers everybody gets access to our

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,250
software and products pretty easily

00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:55,140
trust as extended however to our

00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,570
governance processes full membership is

00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,850
invite-only it's easy to contribute to

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:03,540
the price is less easy to contribute to

00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:05,250
our social processes similarly to fsfe

00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,020
organizational changes where the

00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,240
structure rain mainly uncommon be

00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,390
extended with manifest code of conduct

00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,400
and community working group and there is

00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,140
a deviation between the norms that we've

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,640
codified in divisional manifest in the

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,550
process that we apply in our formal

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,880
organization for example openness and

00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:26,070
transparency or it's the secrecy

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,120
wikimedia this is even more simplified

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,580
because we committee as a huge

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,140
organization the formal structure is

00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,720
just to the community media foundation

00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:37,890
in the US as a far removed sovereign

00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,660
there's a german bv again charitable has

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:42,780
80 staff does not influence manage to

00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,400
represent a community of authors the the

00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,410
grassroots organizations in the regions

00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,020
they build along language boundaries and

00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,670
there is no form of support or structure

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,070
no no form structure for support of

00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:55,380
authors and very informal community

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:57,500
structure decision-making there's a

00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,580
mediation committee an arbitration board

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,280
it's pretty much language and reaches

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,390
specific there's very strong focus on

00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,480
bettering the product so whenever

00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:09,660
decision has to be made the question is

00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,890
what makes Wikipedia better but the

00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,390
formal organization and a community of

00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:15,900
authors are separated and more or less

00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,460
completely independent the community

00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,930
membership and organization is fluent

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,410
because you can very easily become an

00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:23,850
author even unanimously everybody who

00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,890
contributes is considered to be part of

00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,110
the community and there are some admins

00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:31,170
and reviewers that are doing oversight

00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:34,170
it's a social role mostly other than

00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:36,330
that contributions has could it be the

00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,790
equals there's a meritocratic approach

00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:40,230
to is and to merit that you build is

00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:42,180
very closely related to your

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,630
contribution to the software and to

00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,130
order the content anything else as more

00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,600
or less unknown and there's a strong

00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:51,150
disconnect between the staff of the

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,660
organization and the community changes

00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,430
and into the structural organization

00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,110
structure are very rare attempt to

00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,669
retake control by the community have

00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,499
happened

00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:06,350
all filled and there is a very strong

00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:07,639
felt pent-up need for reform so I went

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,649
through this very quickly because

00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:11,779
there's a lot of detail in the paper and

00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:16,159
I only have 30 minutes

00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:18,409
what can we see from this and as I said

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,830
please don't expect simple answers but

00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:24,529
expect some interesting observations the

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:26,090
barriers of entry for contributors into

00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:28,039
your organization and to all

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:31,519
organizations all the others grows over

00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:33,499
time we always think of barriers of

00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,629
entry for newcomers people that join the

00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:39,710
community they want to get account they

00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:43,789
want to push up their first patch you

00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:45,409
have cost basically time invested time

00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:47,869
to understand how this works I attempt

00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:50,210
to build up the merit with every change

00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:52,159
social change of your status within the

00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:54,230
organization if you want it has cost

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,179
involved in but going from to be from

00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:59,210
being a contributor to growing to be a

00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:00,859
member of kdv for example there's more

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,820
cost involved to finally getting on the

00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:06,289
board some of us this is a quote from

00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,909
one of the interviews some of us have

00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:11,899
lost the trust that newcomers will do

00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:14,090
good things there's a natural thing here

00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:15,739
in at play because the longer you are

00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,809
all involved the more experience you

00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:19,730
have which means the newcomers

00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:21,649
contributions are or considered to be

00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,739
not even stupid because you know how to

00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:26,840
do this better right but how do you gain

00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:29,119
new contributors if you if the first

00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,940
response to a patch somebody sends in is

00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,720
this is all wrong you have no idea what

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,179
you're talking about

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,149
go play somewhere else right then you

00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:42,289
don't gain contributors dede open doors

00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:43,999
policy that we we're proud of reasonably

00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:46,220
proud of I think works for new

00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:49,249
contributors and for product based

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,379
contributions in KDE is not working very

00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:57,440
well for higher up status groups like

00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:59,539
being a part of KETV and the the fact

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,409
that all organizations we looked at rely

00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:05,029
a lot on established very informal rules

00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:07,159
means that anybody who wants to navigate

00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:09,109
the organization who is not there for a

00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,419
long time has a lot of trouble doing so

00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:12,260
just understanding who do I need to talk

00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:14,480
to

00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,970
what is this community working group I

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,130
feel slighted I want to talk to somebody

00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,860
about this how do I resolve a

00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:23,780
disagreement over a change if you have

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,090
to spend two years of your time to

00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,740
understand this that makes it makes it

00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:30,950
difficult to become a contributor so

00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,360
that's the barriers of entry grow if you

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,680
translate this this means we as a

00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,570
community need to make sure that these

00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:40,330
barriers are as low as possible because

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:42,680
that's how we get contributors we treat

00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,420
contributions to the product differently

00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,640
than contributions to our governance

00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:52,460
processes we make it very easy for

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:55,040
people to become part of our software it

00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,810
is not easy it is not very that is not

00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,900
inviting to become part of our

00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:01,280
organizations yesterday an EEV assembly

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,560
there was a little debate on how do we

00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,690
make people show up and vote and they

00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,690
offer it and the students worse we throw

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,540
them out if they don't people don't show

00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:14,450
up in your tent participate in your

00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:16,940
formal organization if it's difficult to

00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,830
be there if it doesn't match their

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,230
expectations towards openness and

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:23,510
transparency and if it's not clear where

00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,220
they can contribute right and we can't

00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,320
force people to contribute so we have to

00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:31,070
better better have to make it easy and

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,290
meaningful for them our support of

00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:35,900
organizations you've seen at all three

00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:37,390
groups that we looked at created and a

00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,130
charitable organization in Germany

00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:42,230
interestingly the legal firm that we

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:44,390
have - Evi everybody agrees that it's a

00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,700
great forum because it implements the

00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,740
one share per person idea that

00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,600
open-source also has in the formal way

00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,480
in a legally binding way which is great

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,360
however independent from the legal

00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,590
structure the support of organizations

00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:03,410
that we create kind of like they move

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:06,590
away from the community all all three of

00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:09,020
them show the same effect and that means

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,320
there are no instruments in place that

00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,450
make sure that your organization really

00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,050
performs as as good as possible to

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:21,020
support the community interestingly for

00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:23,090
businesses these instruments are markets

00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,560
or the Supervisory Board for for

00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,780
political systems we have

00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,460
public elections we don't have anything

00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,590
like that in place in our communities

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,230
and as a result the community

00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:36,510
organizations develop a life of their

00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:38,580
own and over time their activities do

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:41,160
not fully support the community anymore

00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,620
as good as they can and as I said Kitty

00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,870
is a probably middle-of-the-road example

00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,680
here we're still doing pretty good what

00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,980
we could do better

00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,540
there is a lack of systematic structure

00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,280
and process review because we don't like

00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:57,780
Authority and we don't like to think in

00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:59,700
formal organization one of this the one

00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,250
of the three communities spent a lot of

00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:06,270
time thinking about their structure and

00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:11,190
statutes in in the beginning I need like

00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:12,600
two more to three variants so one us we

00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,160
didn't spend a lot of time at all in the

00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,320
beginning we all end up in the same

00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,850
place the structures not maintained so

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,100
it deviates from what the community

00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:23,060
needs and then we have the issue of

00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:25,860
transparency which already mentioned and

00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,600
we have the issue of authority what we

00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:31,620
need to realize that we our own highest

00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:34,080
authority I'm afraid that your time up

00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:37,860
just now I know my time is up and here's

00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,230
my final statement in part are we

00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,480
reinventing the wheel right we are

00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,890
discussing governance norms and discover

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,540
covenants norms have been discussed for

00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:48,420
more than a hundred years for businesses

00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,190
for legal bodies etc and we seem to be

00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:53,100
starting from scratch I don't think we

00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,630
have time for questions it will take

00:34:53,100 --> 00:35:09,090
just one question because we're trying

00:34:54,630 --> 00:35:11,280
it sorry any questions ok so we thank

00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:16,179

00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,179
