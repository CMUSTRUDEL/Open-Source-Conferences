Title: Marco Martin - Kirigami, Applications, and Designers - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Lessons learned in balancing the development of an User Interface framework and designing an application: a virtuous feedback loop.

Were we want rigidity and where we want freedom. While designing the Kirigami user interface framework, was of course not possible to predict every possible use case of applications using it. During the design of applications like Discover, the feedback loop between the design and implementation of the application, improved significantly the quality of the framework, and new design elements percolated upwards in the framework and in the human interface guidelines. The quick talk will look at some of those examples, trough demos, code and pretty pictures.

thank you so I will talk about kirigami

00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:26,560
mostly about design of applications done

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:32,820
with kirigami and why we did it so

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:36,280
nowadays on a standard plasma desktop

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,730
most most of the applications that iran

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:43,960
are still done with key widgets like

00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:47,199
there were done in the past 20 years why

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,250
one because that use do so there is a

00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:57,879
lot of legacy and two because key widget

00:00:51,250 --> 00:01:01,659
is nowadays still the best tool for some

00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:05,790
kind of some kind of jobs for very

00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:09,640
complex applications you still probably

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,869
want to use that but since it's not

00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:17,950
technology of course it has many

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:21,070
limitations graphically what you can do

00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:25,990
in the main chrome of your application

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:30,219
it's pretty limited unless you do very

00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,829
complex spaghetti C++ code and that's

00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:35,500
and that's of course bad because it

00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:39,430
limits what you can do but on the other

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,880
side on the other end it's kind of good

00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:48,430
because with this mutation it's kind of

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:51,359
enforces a a coherence between all the

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,729
different applications that then

00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:59,439
comprise the user experience of a plasma

00:01:54,729 --> 00:02:06,729
desktop but this is going to change now

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:13,660
most of the efforts in the UI side from

00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:18,160
the kid company is towards qml that is

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,540
still it's still kind of a kind of young

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,969
it's still

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,379
has its own different set of limitations

00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:30,969
for instance everybody that tried to

00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:33,760
have keyboard navigation on on an

00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:39,819
application just just work out of the

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:43,959
box knows what I'm talking about but on

00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:46,329
the purely graphical side you pretty

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,930
much don't have limitation you can do

00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:51,790
everything you want and that's of course

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:57,730
excellent very very good for creativity

00:02:51,790 --> 00:03:04,810
but if we don't have a very coherent an

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:07,750
even strict design process that could be

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:11,069
in the end bad for the end user

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:14,739
experience because it would it would

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:21,689
bring many applications that are done

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:21,689
with conflicting user patterns so we

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:31,120
ended up thinking about both a design

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,090
language a set of human interface

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:43,560
guidelines and a framework with the same

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:49,780
name with a named kirigami to have a pre

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:54,209
APM we made a set of solutions for very

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:58,560
very basic usage patterns that should be

00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:03,659
ideally across most of our applications

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:08,199
bought on on desktop systems and on

00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:11,409
plasma mobile with with slight

00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,510
adaptations for of course the the

00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:17,470
important screen differences that are

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:20,470
between a desktop and a mobile system it

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:25,509
had already several standalone releases

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:28,560
but scenes from the next framework

00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:31,350
release in August it will be

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:37,550
release together all of the KD

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:41,450
frameworks pack so this exists because

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:45,300
designing full-feature application is

00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:47,850
even both for the developer but also for

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:54,660
the designer it's a very massive task

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:57,540
and it's very easy to do to do weird

00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:02,910
things I'm not saying wrong but but

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:07,200
things that in the end will will not

00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:11,520
fully do user a favor what can happen we

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:16,820
can just look at history on a certain

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:20,150
proprietary platform where in the past

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:25,500
20-30 years many applications were

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:28,910
completely their their own thing they

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,120
looked like their own toolkits their own

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:36,660
operating system almost and I think that

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:40,860
was actually a part of the whole Windows

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,200
is bad and Windows is ugly so we have

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:48,390
potentiality for doing beautiful things

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:51,620
we have risks of repeating a tiny bit of

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:54,620
that history so let's not do that

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,620
whoo

00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:02,760
weird parallel a technique in writing

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,030
actually writing book is to limit your

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,030
own lexicon in order to have a text

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,860
structure that flows more and what we

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:17,000
are doing we adding this artificial

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:22,890
limitation that it's completely obtained

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:29,160
of course to to make design less of a

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:32,310
massive task because all of the problems

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,669
of the base patterns are already solved

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,110
and to put in a really cheesy way in

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:38,400
order to think outside the box

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,990
you know the box in the first place

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,070
basically we are doing the Box then

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:48,370
then you can smash if you want to

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:53,380
conclude with a very fast example Coco

00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:55,450
is a very simple image fever written in

00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:00,640
camel that was written some years ago

00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:04,540
then was extent abandoned for for a

00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:08,410
while now has been has been resurrected

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:10,510
as part of Summer of Code project by

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:14,500
Atul Sharma which I'm mentoring this

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:17,650
year and this is how it looked that it

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,110
was absolutely fine but had it had some

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:26,920
problems and it never really had a

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:30,520
designer input so we went with with the

00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:35,620
ends and the rest of the VD g to look

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:37,540
about what the alternatives could be in

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,680
order to make it as simple as possible

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:45,930
and really a textbook case for kirigami

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,540
so in the end we ended up with some

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:52,470
wireframes for how it could work in

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:56,320
behave for both the mobile case and

00:07:52,470 --> 00:08:00,700
desktop use case this is how it looks

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:03,760
nowadays it's it's still really a very

00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:07,600
early work in progress so there are

00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,780
still several obvious missing pieces and

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,110
layout problems but it's getting there

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:18,870
on the on the left is how it looks on

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:23,320
plasma desktop with the bridge style

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:26,680
also with our experimental cute quick

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,420
controls to style that will paint

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,930
everything like it's braised that will

00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:36,520
be released with the next plasma desktop

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:41,710
release and on the right is how it will

00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:46,200
look on plasma mobile lasting the four

00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:49,870
kirigami our first main target is a

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:53,709
plasma desktop then plasma mobile with

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:57,069
the nice side effect that

00:08:53,709 --> 00:09:01,720
also works pretty well on Android as

00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:04,839
well though it's even if it's not our

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:09,699
primary platform we care as much as

00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:13,059
possible to respect the look of the of

00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:16,899
the platform the look of the design not

00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:20,860
so much the feel because being our

00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:26,079
primary target plasma mobile we want to

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:30,209
innovate in some areas that we think

00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:33,399
that current mobile applications are not

00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:39,480
very good because they hinder it too

00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:43,929
much from from legacy for for instance

00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:47,050
most both on iPhone and Android are very

00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:52,389
top-heavy why's that make it quite hard

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:55,480
to use them on on nowadays big oversized

00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:58,569
phones so we can do a bit better in that

00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:02,930
but apart from that it will look as at

00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:08,740
home as possible and thank you very much

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:08,740
