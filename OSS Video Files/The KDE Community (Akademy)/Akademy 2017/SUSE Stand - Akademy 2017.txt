JONATHAN: So we are here on the openSUSE stall and...who are you?

00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:11,308
DOUGLAS: I'm Douglas Demaio ANTONIO: and I'm Antonio Larrosa JONATHAN: And what are you showing on the SUSE stall today?

00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:18,419
DOUGLAS: So basically with the SUSE here we brought a various collection of our projects.

00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:20,800
We have

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,869
the OBS, Open Build Service. Someone made that so we thought it'd be pretty cool to just support

00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,598
you know, that creativity, and made a

00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,718
Made a sticker to go along with it. We

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,169
also have Tumbleweed which is our rolling release and

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,649
that's been successful, very successful, and

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,559
moving forward with the newest packages.

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,090
Opposite of that

00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,610
we have Leap. So Leap is more of made for endurance, you could say.

00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:53,309
It's more of a...

00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,550
well-established

00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,400
long-term

00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,609
not gonna say support, but... But it's more older packages, you know, that people that

00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:04,660
don't want the newest stuff will get.

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,820
JONATHAN: Well, it is long-term support because, Antonio, you made a comment during your keynote this morning about how you've worked successfully with Plasma. Can you tell us about that?

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,600
ANTONIO: Yes, of course. For Leap we are using the LT support of Plasma and that includes all the latest LT support, the latest LTS packages

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,339
And then in Tumbleweed we have the latest packages.

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,950
Practically released the same day

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,409
or maybe the next day after they are released by upstream. And then, in Package Hub,

00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:38,359
we also have packages from the community which are released for the Plasma version of Leap.

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,499
And then we also have the LTS version of Plasma here in

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,890
KDE packages here from Package Hub.

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,409
JONATHAN: And another great project that has come from openSUSE is Open QA. Can you tell us about that?

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,779
DOUGLAS: Yeah, well I'll go ahead and touch on it briefly. Open QA was a project established during our hack week.

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,000
And so basically, people can benefit from working for openSUSE and being part of the openSUSE project. You get paid for a week to do

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,940
whatever you want to do. So that was developed and

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,209
Open QA is an automated testing system and

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,889
It's being used by openSUSE and Fedora, as well as many other

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,519
projects that are around. It's very beneficial to testing, to testing a lot

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,789
of different things and collaborating with different communities on testing.

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,940
You wanna expand on that a little? ANTONIO: No, I mean, we can maybe add that

00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:42,739
we are testing all the packages every day and everything that gets into Tumbleweed, which is a rolling release, so we have the latest packages of

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,979
every application there. It's tested before it's released for users

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,200
so

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,660
even if it's rolling release, it's quite stable thanks to Open QA. JONATHAN: I know from

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,660
working with the Plasma team that there are people from SUSE who come into Plasma channels to say "hang on, this isn't working" so then...

00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:05,199
...we go "Crap!", Plasma developers go "Good catch, we'll get on and fix that", so that works really well.

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,560
You gave the keynote this morning, Antonio, what did you talk about? ANTONIO: I talked about the KDE community

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,500
and the KDE community's [?]

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,169
and the ecosystem that we have, and how we should collaborate together even more than we are doing right now.

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,080
Which I think is already quite, quite good, but...

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,860
Yeah, I think we have to collaborate more between us.

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,959
JONATHAN: Well, thank you very much. PAUL: I've got a question. JONATHAN: Go ahead. PAUL: This question is for

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,949
Douglas. I know that SUSE...

00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:42,609
SUSE actually installs by default Gnome, what do we have to do in the KDE community to change that?

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,199
DOUGLAS: Well, I think keep doing what you're doing right now, and it will lead to greater...

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,870
greater achievement. I mean, things like this take time, right, and I think Package Hub is a good start for that.

00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,429
But all I can really say from that perspective is: keep going down the path that they're going down, which seems to be

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,170
very, I mean, very positive. Very positive all across...

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,380
