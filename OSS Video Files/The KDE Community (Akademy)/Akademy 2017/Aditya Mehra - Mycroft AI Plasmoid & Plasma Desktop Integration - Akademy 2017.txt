Title: Aditya Mehra - Mycroft AI Plasmoid & Plasma Desktop Integration - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	This presentation will showcase the demo of the Mycroft Plasmoid and itâ€™s Interactions with Mycroft Core. This presentation will also discuss and demo how an intelligent digital assistant can enhance your plasma desktop experience. The presentation will further touch upon the points of how other projects on the plasma desktop environment and other individual standalone KDE projects can integrate with Mycroft to provide a new layer of voice control and user interaction.

Introduction:
Mycroft Plasmoid is a desktop frontend that intends to interact with the Mycroft Core backend which is developed by the team at Mycroft Ai. It is an open source community committed technology that ties natural language processing, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and powerful APIs together to create a powerful experience allowing users to manipulate their devices through voice control. Mycroft Ai is the digital implementation of a modern day virtual assistant on the Linux Platform that can help a user conduct a multitude of task via voice / text.

Goals:
The Mycroft Plasmoid is developed with an aim towards integration of Mycroft Core backend with the Plasma 5 Desktop Environment to provide an open, user rich desktop and an interactive virtual assistant experience to the end users with keeping in mind the principles of free and open source software. This project also aims towards making the virtual assistant a central hub of information and desktop control assistance providing the user a new innovative layer of voice control and desktop interactive technology.

OS X s CD and Android has Google now so

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,209
what about the name

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,980
what about Linux operating system so I'd

00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:21,700
like to introduce to you

00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,560
Mycroft AI microfi I is though is one of

00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,720
the way first open source digital

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,990
assistance available on the linux

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,020
desktop and it's extensible its

00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,329
customizable and it's completely open

00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,980
source so you can anyone can run it on

00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,570
any device like can run it on a

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,789
Raspberry Pi or you can run it on a

00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:45,670
desktop or even a SmartWatch so going

00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:48,990
ahead with a micro Moorehead with

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:52,420
Mycroft AI I like to introduce to you

00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:55,480
the plasmoid that is the front end for

00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:00,660
Mycroft AI on the plasma desktop so you

00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:03,640
can see the plasmoid consists of

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,820
animation bar on the top that gives you

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,740
the micro status it is a start and stop

00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,270
button so you can run Mycroft whenever

00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,840
you feel like and it's not always

00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,820
running and you can even mute micro

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,580
Mycroft when you don't want it to listen

00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,060
to you and you can pin Mycroft to the

00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:25,510
desktop i Rashmi the navigation bar is

00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,690
on the left it has four tabs consists of

00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:31,869
the Home tab it has skill tips it can

00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:35,710
tell you the skill tips tell you um what

00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:38,350
commands you can run the settings tab

00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,570
and install skilled staff so when I talk

00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,490
about skills skills are something that

00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,830
is developed by the community people at

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,240
Mycroft and they can be different skills

00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,000
that integrate with different back-end

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,560
services so it could be basically if you

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,049
have a music player you could integrate

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,510
you could write a skill for micro off to

00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:59,170
integrate with the music player or if

00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:01,060
you have for example a smart bulb or

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,869
philips hue bulb or something you can

00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:09,729
connect micro off to the api and run a

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:11,260
speech recognition command from there so

00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,909
i'm going to be giving you a short demo

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,909
on how microf works

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,819
so this is the plasmid and I'm gonna

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,569
just run a few commands and see what we

00:02:34,819 --> 00:03:02,989
can do on the plasma desktop so hey

00:02:38,569 --> 00:03:04,880
Mycroft open Firefox so let's try

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:05,900
something more what you can do with the

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,280
desktop

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:17,780
hey Mycroft search this computer for

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:20,959
Mycroft I am searching locally for micro

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:29,269
you can even search ok run stuff for

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:39,459
Mycroft I'm afraid I couldn't understand

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:39,459
that hey Mycroft create an activity test

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,390
you rack see that she has been created

00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:01,810
hey Mycroft change wallpaper type

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,810
abstract

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,900
so you can even change wallpapers and so

00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:22,940
now on the plasmoid side some new stuff

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,590
I mean apart from text messages we can

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:33,020
even do we should messages you can

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:35,169
receive visual details Oh micro and you

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:40,660
please repeat that

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,660
hey Mycroft what is the current Adam

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:53,590
with a high of 29 and a low of 28 a 28

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,590
degrees

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,680
so and another thing you can do is

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:11,410
interactive visual messages

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:22,150
hey Mycroft what is the stock price of

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:24,009
Apple Apple Inc with ticker symbol Apple

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,560
is currently trading at one hundred

00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:28,560
fifty point two seven dollars per share

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:40,300
so there's a visual feedback you can

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:46,090
open this up in our external browser

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:49,660
from the plasmoid so this is currently

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:52,180
the state of plasmoid and you can of

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:56,310
course do tech stuff like you can even

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,310
talk to micro off through text

00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:14,139
there's a suggestion button so you can

00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:16,870
select a word from Chuck Norris doesn't

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:19,680
need strike ouch exceptions are too

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,680
afraid to raise

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,540
so that's about for the demo for now and

00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,850
this is our father micro plasmid has

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,600
gotten so what's next for Mycroft

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:47,610
plasmoid so more more skills for the

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,750
plasmoid like it it should be able to

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,730
interact with more applications and more

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,710
integration into the desktop so maybe

00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,480
next time we can say open notifications

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:02,850
or show clear my notification so maybe

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:06,660
play some music based on whatever my key

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:09,660
music keyboard is and easier

00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,580
installation so Mycroft is not clearly

00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,950
not packaged pretty well and we're

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,260
looking for distributions to package

00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,790
Mycroft so everyone can give it a try

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:27,030
and help improve the user experience

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:29,280
better getting involved so microf has a

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,160
slack channel that's where all the

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,440
developers are community guys are

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,890
contributing hat and we all hang out

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,310
there and you could always try compiling

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:43,680
it from the gate that's a good address

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:46,940
so questions

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,160
[Applause]

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:53,179
[Music]

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,179
[Applause]

00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:11,310
I'm not sure so we've seen in the demo

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,080
that it was always quite a significant

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,760
delay between the command and the

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,740
reaction so what what is this delay

00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,330
caused by a lot can be done about it so

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,810
I think my internet connection is really

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,100
bad right now and the wallpaper time and

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,110
take took a lot of trying to download

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,950
the wallpaper so if I'm on a faster

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:32,400
connection and happens much faster so if

00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,349
it's text if I'm doing a text command so

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,450
a text command would probably be much

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:37,860
faster then speech to text because

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,610
speech to text is still going through

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,470
Google SDT and it has to go to the

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:49,740
Google so and then all the way come back

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:53,100
and get processed about the same

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,840
question but I think even with the first

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,680
command that was to open fire force it

00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,440
did had some delay so I'm wondering what

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,870
it has to do with std then comes back to

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,280
the Google Ad I always go to the yeah

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,710
because that's what we're using for the

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,690
speech-to-text engine currently so my

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,480
graph is trying to work with getting

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,370
something like open stt that's the open

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,840
speech-to-text model and they're trying

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,500
to incorporate other things like pocket

00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,170
Springs and stuff doing so we can skip

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:28,920
google stt altogether but it's still a

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:34,410
long shot okay so any more questions I

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:37,260
think we can take one more ok no

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,180
questions cool that was an awesome talk

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,740
thank you I did so much thank you so

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,830
much

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:46,539
