to talk we have a lot of great work

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:33,170
start on the most because we're living

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:36,320
within some typical to within computers

00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:38,150
it I'm gonna dr. egami so once you're

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,180
there for support augment and many

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,940
colleges are end up in the slightest

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,280
fear places we now have upon of where

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,770
you don't remember me and up between

00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,440
involves applying to coordinate the path

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,130
and this is saying is going to the

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,060
cupboard

00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,340
we never what a little things up to him

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:03,080
and hugely different for to have to work

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:14,030
for us and move on Google having a talk

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:18,230
about Robles way with is what yes

00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:20,960
actually we dr. 11g a little of make you

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:25,460
a solution made by a friend to Penn

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,740
Susan and having done a lot of work in

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,950
the area of integration of acceptance

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,349
casting I've come to the conclusion and

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:36,110
we sort of agreed on them they're open

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:39,710
to a can be part of the solution based

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:43,690
upon us all out and fix what we want is

00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:45,980
a two prong approach open K for

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,480
searching for visual state of something

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,910
and X ability testing to test the

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,570
functionalities and I think that your

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:59,740
paper solution they should be reopened

00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,740
and aggression moving forward

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:30,399
Camila has before I had a second book

00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:33,920

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,559
announcement of the five affordable

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,870
arbitration which would be relieved

00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,709
within two days and we just made the

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:46,009
about menopause per year coming soon for

00:09:42,709 --> 00:10:03,410
you and by the way we just have shown

00:09:46,009 --> 00:10:06,319
the features coming and looking on to

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:17,240
room with for bikini application

00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:23,980
developer story so that horrible thought

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:29,680
we gave lately day before on

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:34,510
the story on the way to add and we've

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,450
been thinking the making thought problem

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:42,280
are we can solve it that should pretty

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:46,480
much in most cases I just go to

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:50,160
different actor world and we also been

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:53,440
looking because women and allocate for

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,660
eighteen different joy and automatically

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,620
getting the differences they need to

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,810
work on make that first feature and

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,310
shortly stop clicking the meeting but

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,240
shortly after that meeting Waleed

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:10,330
activities photo type of that we K

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,060
archive which has been a cage for all

00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:15,550
common person and you need a small to

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:20,550
the Baptist simple option in calc I

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,550
doing that so that's

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,810
I picked up the new injustice Cano and

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:37,180
the translation for success so we just

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,370
keep talking which are which have been

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,850
talked in the transition community for

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:46,180
alive economy and which unfortunately

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:49,089
are not easy to speak without manpower

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,880
but of this way identified with what we

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:55,600
think we should do we lent it to the

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,600
website online confession but it's

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:04,390
something which would come later to the

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:07,810
structure of the file structure of the

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:10,120
file on the repository on the usage of

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,700
Osamu simplified like a business letter

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,910
and using sergeant resonances and we are

00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,920
like two or three years of work for many

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,850
people but we'll try to make it work

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,130
somehow

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,160
and if you like to have something to

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,160
contribute in packages between emissions

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,160
doctor

00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:40,830
ready for TNA in that room we had our

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:48,270
speed and the MIDI e automotive let's

00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:50,940
Mexico hosts ok so after my life is of

00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:54,110
yesterday the first question does need

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,339
to be soft today if you're interested in

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,589
approaching the automotive sector at the

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,970
conclusion of the voltage gets the

00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:04,920
second one is can we do something

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:08,490
credible in a very short period of time

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:11,010
so we explore their three lines of word

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:14,520
one of them seems very feasible going to

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:16,230
be analyzing the click weeks it would

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,800
music that they're people that can do

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,839
that and I'm excluding to them so

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:26,250
probably in a few weeks we will be able

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:33,290
to say you can do something the shorter

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:33,290
that could have to approach and explore

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:52,580
at last ball I complained on the

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:56,290
schedule let's welcome our very own evil

00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,290
overlord Lydia

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:06,139
sorry henchmen of argument

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:15,329
right fighting through two little things

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,199
where this capital income is politically

00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:20,660
lightly and the basically after event

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:25,709
process my figure that number of ideas

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:28,800
today didn't I get in more detail and

00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:31,290
one of them was have the edge of

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:36,089
searching format of the General Assembly

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:38,430
by using out all okay and reports on the

00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:40,350
working groups will be all this

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,329
attachment in working with is not it

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,759
doesn't have to be private to the TV

00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:48,980
could be having a difference in

00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,980
application for the spoken mostly

00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:56,160
enrollment efforts a possible side

00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,889
effect of patent might be necessary

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,800
becomes short enough to fit into another

00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:04,170
day when my dating or within it could

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,040
then because when things will be on the

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:10,920
morning meetings that will have to be

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,759
check whether it's active or at least an

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,490
idea making

00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,459
think more public translated it will set

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,800
for accident has a number of things that

00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:22,020
might

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,730
not storing the burial country not

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,450
making the Dakota story bit more about

00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,170
the community

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:31,680
and the president I paid one magic ID

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:34,980
that respect where it was wonderful that

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,100
we had was i we learn that the

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:41,600
responsibility in the piece of food

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:44,670
involves you spread very simple evening

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,160
we are where anyone is have to

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:50,940
contribute even to save much of the

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,310
substance and the idea was that it seems

00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,790
to be possible to main menu happen the

00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:59,430
first one - one type feature on email no

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:05,070
idea that might work purpose of a I

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:11,220
realized agreement and a number of other

00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:14,910
eye the eye design as we might know

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,920
about the dog has in the factories that

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,150
something they can focus our life here

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,190
we are available to answer your

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,950
questions to left over something that

00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:24,780
exists that the agency followed that

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:28,400
possibly working groups to do the same

00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,820
and make it available for particular and

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,550
over anything

00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:35,460
now them the first thing is most

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:38,760
important and I think we discussed a lot

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:42,570
about the idea the community together

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,300
setting up compost and in sort of

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,150
direction

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:50,750
in the nation reality and the age of

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:53,270
that is to have a a system where people

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,720
can see I didn't say I think we should

00:16:53,270 --> 00:17:01,370
do another I think you can work on one

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,710
of the doors like if possible things

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,360
that are across the board rather than

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:09,440
don't want to do in one application

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:13,370
right and this is easy like this and

00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,260
then admitted to a vote by the whole set

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:18,190
of possibilities right impinges another

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:22,370
can achieve that it was open to the city

00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:25,910
possibly even all the uses and the idea

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:28,580
was probably making had the two set of

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:31,220
people voting and you can check what we

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,790
want work on an order you would like us

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:38,510
to if there is any anything that even

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:42,530
want to vote items so the any observable

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:44,900
there is political spoke is ie by

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:48,050
preference I did for about a month ages

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,120
order setting something but having more

00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,250
priority than others and then if we

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,070
collect automatically we can say okay

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:59,060
for the next yeah we will have been two

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:01,340
or three proposals that have been sort

00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,130
of accepted by the community there was

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,160
that actually that the people who have

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,470
submitted this and even like one person

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,370
good

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,480
who are interested in that and they

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:18,740
because there are any has been affected

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,020
that they will have the option to bring

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,410
the screen around LNG and they don't

00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:28,530
forget a little telling you where they

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:32,780
can where they can present the

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,780
that protects the

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:41,790
so yes beautiful revolutionary idea and

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:45,420
everyone in the room with the idea of

00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:48,150
the mixer is exactly spinning it and see

00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,190
what other people think about it and and

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,790
some success in a wider power of this

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,920
one idea of this you not bad you know we

00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,230
are taking city to commit American too

00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,100
much a tool that you have talked about

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,720
that before as a way to sort of everyone

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,560
working on their own little thing in the

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,310
recital

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:11,700
so having wait wait for ideas and then

00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:14,010
to give you a random person work

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,190
together on something which is a bit

00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:19,920
more original purpose than you know

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,260
attacking of innocence and authority on

00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,290
Fridays it's all about having this plan

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,810
the common brainstorming to walk Congo

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:32,280
which in my opinion used to happen when

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:35,510
we were in elementary thing as a meeting

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,510
with wasn't activity

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,429
so instead better over the Internet

00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,230
volatile mix with more structure and

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:49,310
picture things that we are interested in

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:52,700
for the next year that we

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,700
