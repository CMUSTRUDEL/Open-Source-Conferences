Title: Aleix Pol Gonzalez - A Laptop by KDE - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	We'll go over the process we went through between the opportunity, the set up of the initial idea and how it evolved with time and different people's contributions until we were able to have a product to deliver.

Furthermore, we'll look into what's the state of the project, what's the next steps and whether could we replicate the experience.

welcome back from the short break our

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:18,170
next talk is by alex paul gonzales it's

00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:28,699
on a laptop by KD

00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:34,400
how does KD conceived artists device all

00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:38,510
right so well thanks again for putting

00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,160
up with me once more and well while I'm

00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,470
repeating I'm still going to introduce

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,660
myself because well this presentation is

00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,190
going to be possibly the weirdest

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,230
presentation I've ever done I've always

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:53,150
been talking about code and programs and

00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:55,580
executing applications and well Android

00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,990
and Kay develop and stuff like that this

00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:01,130
time we're going to talk about hardware

00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:03,440
which is subject that well I think ad we

00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,290
don't know a lot about and well me

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,890
myself I don't know a lot about either

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:13,159
but what I'm super happy to be here and

00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:17,390
to be talking about that in general in

00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:20,630
KD we do make we make software right we

00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,310
we program we we think a lot about how

00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,430
people are going to use our software and

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,979
we try to make everything very flexible

00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,550
but then in the end we make software

00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:34,250
right and our software without any

00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:38,000
exception needs to be running on on

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,130
Hauer so I'm really really sure that all

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,650
of you your trajectory in KDE you've

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,020
faced this well

00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:49,340
oh but conversation where people are

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:52,490
telling you so I hear that you work on

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,700
this Linux thing this KD thing well what

00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,020
should I buy I want to use it this thing

00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,119
in the beginning I had these kind of

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,260
questions from my family and my friends

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,210
and well well you can always say well

00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,070
you just buy anything because Linux

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,039
works everywhere it's amazing it's

00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,409
brilliant in what you still have are

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,200
telling them well - what right there

00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:17,240
operating system - why why what the

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,880
provider they bought their laptop from

00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,540
well worked on putting their

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:27,920
and and well change it into something

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:30,020
that well me and I another group of

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,030
geeks have been working on admittedly

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,880
thousands and thousands of geeks but

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:43,070
still geeks on on on our what free time

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:46,010
or professional time but in general we

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,350
need to have something that that we can

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,930
tell people to use to love and to

00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,450
embrace and at the same time we need to

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,920
get closer to the users like I said on

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,650
my other presentation if you were there

00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,620
one one of the specific problems that

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,930
I've detected since I've been working in

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,690
KDE is that we are a bit far away from

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,280
our user sometimes we need to strengthen

00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,160
this this this feedback loop to make

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,400
sure that if there's an issue they can

00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,230
get back at us and that when when we

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,280
provide something that they can leverage

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:22,130
it as soon as possible and what this

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,130
kind of ties to what this project I'm

00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,930
we're going to talk about which is which

00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,810
is what we ended up calling the kiddie

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,490
aslim book so here you know about Katy

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,170
maybe you know about slim book because

00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,770
while we announced this months ago but

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:39,830
for those of you who don't I'm going to

00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:42,290
give a bit of an idea of the how the

00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,030
story went and how we ended up here with

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,300
me talking about this we had we had

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,010
project so everything started with

00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,670
Balthazar who is a very stubborn person

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,610
and well he needed a laptop he doesn't

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:59,090
consider himself developer or even a

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:02,510
very tech savvy person and he found this

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:07,220
this company who was actually he's found

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:09,470
it very near where he is from and what

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,840
they were selling Linux laptop so it was

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,540
well kind of related to what I was

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,430
saying before he was asking for really

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:21,620
long time how do I do - well get the

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,660
this kiddie you guys are doing on my

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,880
laptop it's not that he didn't know the

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,520
answer right he already had a blog for

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,620
years about KD he had been reviewing our

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,710
applications but he clearly knew that it

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,650
was it was too complex and

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:40,190
that it was awkward to get a laptop with

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:42,520
an operating system to wipe so well he

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,720
fell in love with with the product and

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,000
started to poke me about it

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:52,490
but to be honest I didn't really do much

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
about it at the time because it was too

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,850
early

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,530
I always need like a couple of months to

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,190
be complaints on on something then I

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,630
start pushing it like a maniac but I

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:06,980
need a couple of months and it was

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:10,610
Academy II as in 2016 when it was in

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,790
Madrid and Balthazar because he's very

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:17,000
stubborn he dragged Alejandro to to join

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:19,370
to join the Academy as where he had the

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,010
presentation Alejandro is the slim book

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:27,190
Gaia's I usually call him when I talk to

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:29,810
you guys and well he started showing us

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:32,480
well the the laptop that they're selling

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,700
and telling us about how and why they

00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,160
love Linux making products with it and

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,010
so on and so forth and at that point we

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,110
started talking about how we could what

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,780
they were actually discussing whether it

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:49,450
would make sense to have slim book

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:52,070
laptops shipping neon by default and and

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,660
at that point well I mean they could

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,420
instant me on if they wanted because

00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,370
what neon is free for anyone to use so I

00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,870
mean we don't even need to give them

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,560
permission or anything like that right

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:07,370
but it feel it felt like too easy and

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,830
too short and narrow-minded well what we

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,560
could achieve and well to be honest it's

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,380
it was some something that we have

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,960
discussed with many members in cadiz

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,690
pain from long ago specially Alex where

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,940
we're talking about how for example it's

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,380
really cool how Apple can very well

00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,880
integrated with the with the hardware

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,940
they make because what they know what

00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,290
Hauer is is going to to be there and we

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:37,010
never have had this opportunity and well

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,810
we had some people interested in in us

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,330
using their hardware and give it giving

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,760
it some love so it was food for thought

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:47,390
at least and it wasn't until Academy

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,220
2016 when we gathered again where

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:53,820
well I sat down with yen's and and

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,160
Thomas and we had very much but a set of

00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,140
very long conversations about whether it

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,310
would make sense to make such a project

00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,740
where it wouldn't whether it would make

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,590
sense to like put a lot of or some

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,780
effort into into having such project

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,670
happening actually one of my my concern

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,400
did in the in the beginning was that we

00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,960
would well now instead and maybe it

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,120
wouldn't be a big deal

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,520
so I actually wanted at least to have

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,440
some kind of consensus with my friends

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,290
and not be working alone on it because

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,300
it wouldn't have sucked which is well

00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,130
also kind of a reason for doing things

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,570
in KDE right like you can always work

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,210
from home alone but if you don't want to

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:32,580
work from home alone well kid is a place

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,890
for doing it any case at that point we

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,200
started discussing what we wanted what

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:41,370
was the the kind of thing we could offer

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:45,540
with well a reasonable amount of work

00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,530
and that could be directly be useful to

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,350
both our

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:54,060
directly or users and to communicate the

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:56,310
KD values and while the plasma features

00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:00,240
right so we started working on it that

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:05,910
was after kid con of course maybe it was

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,620
between September and December and when

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,450
we knew what we wanted we started

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,430
talking about distributions and as you

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:15,690
know what at the moment we've only been

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:20,100
offering or slim book has only been

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:24,390
offering the the KD slim book with with

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,790
neon we talked about about this subject

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:30,090
with many distributions actually it was

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:32,370
kind of the intention to see if it would

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,050
be possible to work with others but we

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,339
still didn't want to lose the the grip

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:41,550
of making sure that that if our KD

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:44,400
developer may submitted a fix submitted

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:48,440
a new version of some software this this

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,880
offer would get into them into the the

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,339
devices that the users are using which

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,830
is kind of I would say the whole point

00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,430
of having a device that is provided by

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,990
KD if KD is providing some kind of

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,700
quality this quality should be on the

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,790
users computers it shouldn't be sitting

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,010
on git repository waiting for it to be

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,740
packaged or waiting for a release cycle

00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:14,850
to arrive because our release cycle is

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:18,630
our release cycle and well it's the best

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:21,360
way we got at least at the moment but

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:24,540
then as soon as all of this was decided

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,029
we worked on the on the website actually

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:31,800
if you think about it well this website

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:36,720
and dot News was mostly what what we did

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:42,149
so this website was mostly against his

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:45,480
work he did most of the text and all of

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,440
the graphics and well if you if you go

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,370
through it

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,220
beyond the KDS slim book anecdote if you

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,160
want you can see a little bit the kind

00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,750
of things we were thinking about that

00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,200
the kind of things we believe that are

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,209
useful and beneficial about plasma and

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,660
the reason why we think that that people

00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:11,010
should be purchasing products that are

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,899
powered by was not only by plasma or KDS

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:18,029
software but by free software and open

00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:20,940
source and well then there was the

00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:22,740
device this is one of the specific

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,320
things about the device is the engraved

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:30,300
logo it's something that we also really

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:33,270
kind of wanted it would have been rather

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,579
weird if we didn't have our on well

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:39,600
footprint somehow on the on the device

00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:41,640
and what we got to use these these laser

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,410
engraving and I think it looks pretty

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,020
cool also it was done by ends of course

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:50,700
I wouldn't have been able to use our

00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:54,029
logo on a laptop but I think I think it

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,220
looks great actually like this is the

00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,630
the case that the previous version of

00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,790
the slim book was using the newer

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,220
version didn't allow for laser engraving

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,110
but we actually really really asked them

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,040
if we could do something like that

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:11,640
because well we like putting our logo

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,470
everywhere but then the we wanted to

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,820
have good coverage we had the product

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:18,480
the product more or less

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:21,180
ready we we had customized some somehow

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,770
we knew what suffer we wandered right so

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,080
it was a matter of telling the world

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:28,800
about what what we were about up to so

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,500
well first thing Thomas worked on on the

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,910
dot story alone you if you go through it

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,910
you can you can also see kind of

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:40,080
Thomas's soul in it and all of our or

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:43,350
thoughts at that time but but it's kind

00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:47,400
of related obviously to what what the

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:50,180
KDS limbic website says and then we

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:54,330
believe that one of the big successes of

00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:59,070
the whole enterprise has been the medium

00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:00,060
response one of the facts is that the

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,000
most-visited

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:08,130
news article in the dot last year was

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,830
was the the slim book announcement and

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,950
well in fact not only the that article

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:18,720
was quite widespread at some point but

00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:22,410
lots of new sites in the well in the

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,700
business we're also telling about about

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:29,870
the the project it's interesting to see

00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:33,330
also what kind of things they were well

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:36,390
putting the the accent on regarding

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:40,230
regarding the project like whether it

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:43,110
was a Linux laptop itself and how it was

00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,150
a contrast to Windows actually I don't

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,040
really have this impression that Windows

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,900
is the lot of thing anymore actually

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,620
like lots of people are using Apple but

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:59,130
well looks like ZDNet do still have this

00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:02,430
impression PC world some more local news

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:04,370
also the fact that slim book is a

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,910
Spanish company got some special

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:11,250
treating by by Spanish press or maybe

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,800
just because my Google is assuming that

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:18,450
since I am in Spain I I look for things

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:21,680
in Spanish who knows but in general it

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,760
had a good deal of localized

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,290
coverage which is always interesting

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,230
because we cannot always get ourselves

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:30,600
everywhere and while seeing others

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:34,770
but being a speaker of our thoughts it's

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,910
always nice right and in the end was the

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,500
conclusion after this was announced in

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:44,160
January I think it was let's let's see

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,910
if we can see it on the dot article it's

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,110
not yeah

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:52,410
26 January and since we've sold 44

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,330
devices well it's up to you if to decide

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,220
if it's a lot or not I believe it's

00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:01,080
really cool actually it's more devices

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:04,440
that mean we've ever sold it's it's

00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:08,190
interesting well technically it's slim

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,950
Bocuse all those devices right but it's

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,170
it's been interesting to see people not

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,140
only interested in using our software

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,510
but well to put their there bugs and

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,310
their interest on buying something that

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,880
they're going to be while using for the

00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:26,210
next 2 3 4 years or more right I don't

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,770
know how many people how many years

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:34,020
people use our laptops but I think it's

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:36,450
really cool so the thing about the

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,640
conclusions is that I am going to not be

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,640
giving a lot of conclusions just yet I

00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,520
think that it's is what more than a

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,100
project in itself is it's been a test by

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,320
us it's it's something that we have

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,150
never done and it's something that we

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,250
should be thinking about whether we want

00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:59,460
we want to do it again whether we

00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:04,080
whether it was a good idea and whether

00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:06,630
we should be doing it again right so one

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,250
of the things I could ask you to do is

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,310
to talk to those name book guys have

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:13,710
been on the on the holes during the

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,840
whole weekend and about doing Academy

00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:19,200
yes as well I hope all of you have

00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,990
talked to them and well before alejandra

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,280
is gonna tell us something because yes

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,280
yes yes yes you're going

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:38,980
thank you

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:44,079
well it's a pleasure to be here being

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:47,529
the able to meet the KDE members we have

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,350
been talking with for the last few

00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:53,949
months v-mail

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:58,329
we are happy to see our customers about

00:15:53,949 --> 00:16:08,639
our laptops a few months ago are still

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:08,639
enjoying and use it the event and so

00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:15,670
sorry

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:19,389
the event also been a good experience to

00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:24,100
meet new people who shown interest on

00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:28,480
the laptops KDE is a powerful yet simple

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:33,040
desktop that we are proud of her with

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:37,300
her laptop because we think it's has a

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,410
necessary to be used for new Linux users

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:45,360
and more advanced er developers

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:50,470
keyd the best part of of Linux is the

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:55,589
the community and we think truly believe

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,589
that the KDE is best one

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,250
but I hear that they're living really

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,110
soon so if you have something that you

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,120
want to tell them just run to them

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,949
there's alejandro and Tesser who i

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,329
believe is still there you can you can

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:13,720
talk to them they're really nice people

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:17,480
and very passionate about the products

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,819
also talk to yen's Harold Thomas and

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,559
Jonathan and and myself who are the

00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:24,799
people who have been working the most on

00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,780
the project I think that well after

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,049
these this Academy it will be the right

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:32,240
time to start what thinking about the

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,990
what are around conclusions and why we

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,750
want to make of this laptop project

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,940
laptop enterprise so talk to them give

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,650
tell them your feelings tell tell us

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:50,030
your feelings and well there it will be

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:52,520
where we will use them to make up our

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:55,130
minds and well from here thanks to all

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,070
of them as well for for all of this work

00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,590
it's been the not super rewarding work

00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,260
as in we didn't really know what would

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:05,540
happen but well in the end I think it's

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:09,320
it's been really fun we've all learned a

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:13,880
lot of it lot about well things that are

00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:17,299
not software itself and and my personal

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,660
thanks to you guys and now if you have

00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:22,340
any questions you can you can tell me

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:26,480
because what I don't really have I think

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:29,110
it's much more specific to say X

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,110
Jonathan

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:39,230
any questions do you have ideas on how

00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:44,480
to turn that 44 devices into more like

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:46,760
440 or 44,000 sorry again do you have

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,070
ideas on how to turn that 44 devices

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:54,110
sold into more something more like 440

00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:57,080
or 4400 is that even our job do you

00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:01,940
think well there's definitely ways I

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:04,850
mean or marketing I don't know different

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,070
device more newer device there's

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:14,149
definitely ideas the question is whether

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:17,720
it's up to us or not right it's up to us

00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:21,740
to make sure that Linux and free

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,380
software are viable on on personal

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,919
informatics right on professional

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,899
informatics just as well we need to make

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,059
sure that we're capable of being there

00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:34,340
that's the main point from my point of

00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,710
view that doesn't mean that it's our

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,649
responsibility to actually be the ones

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,389
in these laptops or actually pushing

00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:45,010
them I would be the most honored though

00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:48,470
if though all of those 44 million

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:51,440
devices are running plasma any software

00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,730
or even free software right but we need

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,789
to make sure that we're doing the best

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,440
and actually these is an enterprise to

00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:59,720
make sure that we are doing the best and

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,700
to be able to define if we're not doing

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,299
the best what we should be doing to be

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,299
doing the best

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:18,140
how come you are not using one that's a

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:20,840
good question I do have one but I using

00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:24,220
for testing mostly like one of the

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:28,520
things we wanted to make sure is that

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:31,070
when a new customer got one of these

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,550
laptops if he had a problem we would be

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:36,830
able to react properly right and well my

00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:40,240
system setup is crazy and it's

00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:43,580
definitely not what we want to put on on

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,559
well a delivered laptop so I thought it

00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,360
would be fine like that the laptop and

00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,760
this little clap top I have the password

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,740
is one two three four if any of you

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,510
still that you already know the password

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,190
right and the idea is that if somebody

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,350
finds a problem I can give it to him and

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,900
and and and that's it that doesn't mean

00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:03,860
you couldn't have two of them but while

00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:06,580
my budget is limited we have time for

00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,580
one more question

00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:24,310
I was just going to ask do you know what

00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:25,930
sort of people that the 44 purchases are

00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,630
are they developers for instance that

00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,870
there's a similar Dell program but I

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,720
think that's really just targeted at

00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:37,510
developers in enterprises so have the

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,160
people who bought these Katy laptop so

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,850
they they develop the software

00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,490
developers or are they people are gonna

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:46,870
you just use a word processor say

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,820
because maybe there's much more

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:52,090
advantage in it being a developer

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:54,130
machine than a word processing I don't

00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,290
know definitely and it's actually part

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,360
of the discussion something that I was

00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,090
literally discussing with with Alejandro

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,680
before is whether like what is kind of

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,170
laptops for if it's more of a

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,940
professional kind of his user who asked

00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,320
them to do a survey because that you

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,430
know they're probably enthusiastic they

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:16,030
would respond I don't I don't really

00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:18,610
have the names of people because laws

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,950
don't allow me to have such names I know

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:24,190
that many of the people who bought them

00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:26,410
are they badly bothered specifically

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,630
because it was something by KD and

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,800
they're passionate about KD well some

00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,050
developers you can see some people

00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,060
around here and and people on the

00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,630
outside I don't really know if I know 44

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:39,610
people right so we don't really know all

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,990
of all of the people who bought it but

00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,920
definitely like having more information

00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:47,580
is one of the things that KD has to be

00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,870
doing for the next few years not only

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,950
coming from the laptops we might have

00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:56,470
sold but on all of the projects and

00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,360
products we want on ourself right we

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,310
need to know more about plasma users we

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,470
need to know more about who buys slim

00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:06,760
books we need to know more about contact

00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:11,200
users or KD ideal users are we going to

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:15,060
see soon some kind of blog posts or

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:21,600
report about experience for of producing

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:24,550
KD yes yes I have thought about about

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,610
making a blog post I probably want to do

00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:31,980
that but I don't want to do it before I

00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:31,980
have well I have a conclusion right I

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:43,990
think there are no more questions

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:46,660

00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,920
