Title: Luigi Toscano - Translation and User Documentation in the KDE Community: An Overview - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	A working program is not enough if its potential users can not use it. The availability of translation and user documentation can make the life of the users easier. What does this mean in the KDE community?

Even if the knowledge of the English language is more widespread than in the past, a properly localized program can be accessed by more users, and translation is central part of it. On the other side, while the default behavior of a program should be "good enough", not everything can be directly self-discoverable. User documentation (and its translation!) can't simply go away.
The talk will try to answer questions like: how are the translation and documentation processes implemented in the context of the KDE community? What are the challenges? What are the possible future developments?

I am so happy does all these internet

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,609
network while people think I treatments

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:31,619
I've recently called transitions and

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:33,420
digital vision and stuff so many of you

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,470
already know me but just to say two

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,620
things in my time for a support engineer

00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,210
in the reductively on the sub team so

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,240
something completely different civil

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,970
substances that it's finite means to

00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,760
have a context which but on the other

00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:55,410
side might retire even before generally

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,570
I wasn't I had country partly community

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:04,970
so many computer starting late-night

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:08,430
facility since turbulent five during

00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:11,820
contribution to various projects over

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,439
world one of the first big ones and

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,969
almost be helping our children to become

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,789
transactions and we thought secret

00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,700
because laters but mostly helping out

00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:28,549
with the international

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:32,329
- infrastructure and maintaining part of

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:35,869
the production chain especially native

00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:37,969
to central center and unfortunately

00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:40,579
sometimes something I would like to do

00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:43,329
but I know Tonya is doing some probably

00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:44,960
phony insurance but that's not a

00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:49,460
different story

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,549
going to the zombie so we're going to

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,670
see how the transmission and the

00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:58,729
profession are structured some general

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,950
idea of how is working and we think if

00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,140
you want to go to check later how it's

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,530
working to more be candid information

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,360
and we or they want to show us some

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,540
challenges that we're facing right now

00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,400
or that is what they see from my point

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,690
of view and things that can be improved

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,980
just to start the detailed explanation

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:27,079
of the technical details your insulin

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:28,310
injection chain explained in a nice

00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:32,030
internet-based

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:36,889
but few things I'd like to highest that

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:39,950
we have five internationalization

00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:43,450
branches even finding the name the

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:47,650
governor blaming the doctor is on up

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:49,780
that's still there for some good reasons

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,730
especially related to the work that we

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,190
need to do so when I do my dance for

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,520
immunity to touch all the translation

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,140
for language even want to have

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:04,600
transmissions which into different

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:07,720
velocities silly and it doesn't impact

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,380
developer so it should be still fine as

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,920
you can see from the name the names the

00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:21,010
trunk the first one usually is the one

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:25,090
who talks the most development thing the

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,730
stable branch starts to stable match for

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,590
frame of five things and so on the

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,780
exception is the last wrench which is

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,120
the special wrench field especially for

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,970
here yes rockman probably well meant

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:41,200
whether it will be computer places with

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,780
a new plasma and yes even if there is

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,360
going to be a bit of overlap we should

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:51,220
be able to just remove your concessions

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:55,440
and just do part exist from them this is

00:03:51,220 --> 00:04:01,450
the beautiful before he details of water

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:04,690
which each branch and as you can see the

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,220
meaning of try and stable dimension

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,620
video on the context of what we are

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,989
talking so for example in the case of

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,600
frameworks every Turkish security Sparta

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:17,049
pronounced the master branch of

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:21,669
alternatives which are crayons party

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:25,390
fighting time and ten and a five and the

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:26,139
other the other branches the other 18

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,110
and

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:30,599
define frameworks because friend is

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,699
matchless

00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:38,009
kadian reassurances won't complicated

00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:40,749
one so usually drunk and stable

00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:44,699
Trackmaster and right now are the issues

00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:47,770
and either delayed the venom of the

00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:52,680
variation is still basically concave or

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:59,110
or it based on Frank Olson we could have

00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:06,520
those two or the the frame x1 in case of

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:09,330
plasma master I can't say trust plasma

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,300
bible 10 right now and there yes is

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:17,050
positive and I just took example father

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:20,830
project like people God as the master

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,199
branch start by trying patent and they

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,210
find and receive an all stable branch

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,909
importance and there are few issues

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:31,750
which are this is safe we are trying to

00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:35,469
phase out the old is for register from

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,960
instruments where the oldest

00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:40,649
informations were identifying so the

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:45,510
source of truth should be the

00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:49,020
recommended registry information

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,860
also in translation branches this is for

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,120
historic reasons it's in at some point

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,450
and it's the comments that sometimes

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,850
people forget what is the translation

00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:04,560
adventists or some strange things can

00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:07,470
happen and so we separate definition and

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,720
we wanna be loved of course this is not

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,150
efficient at all we want to do it and

00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,220
just one source of food but it's not

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,880
like something it does not do fingers

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:21,150
and you do it so we need to consider the

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:27,000
occasional check if things are going to

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:30,120
break something wrong happens the things

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,970
about the just corners it really

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,350
listening project that very hard to

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:39,780
forget the information 20 on the

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,460
information era is generally equal to

00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,760
the external if you heard about that

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:49,260
still using the infrastructure around by

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:52,890
use whisper there is poured away from

00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:56,420
that and supportive information is

00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:59,480
necessary files for dilation and

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,150
Jason for his father's in some cases

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,070
there are some people's and you can see

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,770
here an example of the definition just

00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:09,980
based on the client the only exception

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,630
is that there is no target there is kind

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,450
of a special special exception so you

00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:18,440
won't find that if there is a scent

00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:25,520
force or so that the parties can't alter

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:31,300
that and from yesterday just give you

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:36,820
some numbers in dormancy this one the

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,820
fragrance man starts like more than

00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,650
160,000 US states which are usually

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,370
smaller ones but sometimes hear my own

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:48,920
description context and so and more 15

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,290
languages are over 90% and that's

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,600
important because even if we have a lot

00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:57,650
of legacy and some things are not so our

00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:02,630
product is still the defective the most

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:06,110
branches are so there are many many high

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:08,360
percentage it should be instantly there

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,770
is some work there and more important we

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,550
are back more than 60,000 of combination

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:19,010
Springs and those are really really huge

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,960
you can eat like a partner professionals

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,360
that's why you can still we have

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,300
languages which was which are more than

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,360
75 percent and video comparison on the

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:33,710
old stable cables for branch we are

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,760
still quite a few wrinkles 50,000 us

00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:40,850
means coordination of publication but

00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:43,820
even see the person is there is in high

00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:49,610
eternal if they are still be that person

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:55,040
is that they even move too much so it's

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:57,260
a matter of space and the interesting

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,300
things is that everything is better

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:03,050
don't get taxed even the work is not

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:06,310
naturally based on context that is

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:10,760
basically the most users form up in the

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:13,880
New World and Moving's work process we

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,430
are not using it but mostly anyways when

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,820
you get quite a good deal it is a the

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:23,950
best fine it's a simple text form with

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:29,390
you you cannot be an active that's you

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:31,520
and the data are to each thing the

00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:37,280
details but for example wearing to

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:43,570
handle also to eat cute it gets fired

00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:46,640
some magic testifies that supplied finds

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:50,960
JSON files or plugins are sweet files

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:57,110
and the condition for coming on top but

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:59,810
we will see later one things I'd like to

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,510
mention is that few teams are using two

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:05,030
colors your summits and it's really

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,010
using as I mentioned previously we have

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,660
some duplication so you can expect it

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,030
for example

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:15,890
plasma there are main main streets in

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:24,800
common between master ready things

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:28,100
changes 70% passages are same or is it

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,980
missing tooth hello mystery takes all

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,800
the same message Chicago the same your

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,740
file for all branches and become it

00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,690
creates a consolidated file with all the

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,630
streams for all branch from all branches

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,040
which is nice and basically my personal

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:47,840
experiences that they couldn't manage

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,030
anything without that's the way you

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,850
don't use some special basically Union

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,890
the only thing is that it's not fully

00:10:52,850 --> 00:11:01,220
integrated with our infrastructure the

00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:09,010
basic progression that you need and this

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:12,110
is not every day when the sensor mean

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:20,630
you need to take the new translation

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:22,490
place to basic the place and rebuild the

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,100
merge selection and this is something

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,860
under this should be done by English

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:32,660
translation team so take new templates

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:35,990
and general merged with the Murchison

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,810
translation in templates and finally

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:43,339
there is a starter so take the public

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:46,000
domain translation in the Masonic branch

00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:49,130
and push them to the corresponding

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,060
brushes and this is also something that

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,060
each modulation

00:11:52,190 --> 00:12:01,370
so it's not a total area it's your own

00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:07,700
from my own view that the times spend

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:09,940
not checking each branch it's more than

00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:14,360
this I'm expanding the merchants company

00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:16,430
on the developer side the in the cold

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:21,980
translatable state of the market as such

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:24,470
and for Alice's it works both for the

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,530
gettext translations and the one based

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:31,760
on computer system and the documentation

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:33,530
of k9t and end frame on which provides

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,430
the tech support there is a masculine

00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:41,330
guy which is because content which is

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:44,270
specific for that frame of travels you

00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:46,760
increase in suggestion on how to code in

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:49,250
a way to don't complicate the right

00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:53,510
translators and in the end you have a

00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:55,310
better editor interface so even if it's

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,730
either there is more today

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:03,440
interesting you may see in the hall some

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:06,530
files for messages of Sh those are those

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,380
are questions even still you can adjust

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:12,470
like fashion messages the message but

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:15,050
they are user to there anyways just a

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,320
scenario to define which fires a file

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:23,710
which detects templates so I take all

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,710
the files directly and target is

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,880
three cemented in place for desktops

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,870
images of capacity and reliability by

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,990
the session speaks you may see some

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:41,600
other expenses or examine messages they

00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:48,550
are easy to manage testified files and

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:50,690
translation my clients the

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:55,760
interconnection of this one

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:58,900
sweetie is the collection of speed of

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,700
the network speculation as pizza and

00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:05,570
which does dimension every night during

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:08,420
the European banks in France of all

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,880
branches so encouraged - get all the

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,760
strength from honorable sequence of data

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,720
get extant blades merge the existing

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,090
transnational in Eaton Place and then

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,150
also there's a logic to do something

00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:26,960
with the subject of suffice and then

00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:29,560
does the ingestion of the changes on the

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:35,060
desk of Jason asking price into the

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:37,790
various velocities back so this is

00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:40,070
happens every night we recently switched

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:44,540
to a new machine which more powerful

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:47,660
switch if somebody was taking like nine

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,480
ten hours I think now it's it's like six

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:54,050
now it's in the last five hours six

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,970
hours it's really the biggest issues

00:14:54,050 --> 00:15:01,329
with the

00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:07,300
it's like I wanna help so if we probably

00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:09,399
knew successfully more the translation

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,949
for the week is a different story

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,720
specially participates it was something

00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:17,410
of a new page and sometimes the

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,079
documentation there the the weeks are

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:31,420
related directly on my resume extension

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:35,379
for me which you can support the import

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:38,170
the professional accidentally and it's

00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:40,839
been the circle migration when you with

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:45,699
the possible connection in translators

00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:47,589
impressive translation scheme so in each

00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:50,800
other at one transaction detail pages

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:53,620
and never stink the communication from

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:58,870
the person on the translation listen

00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:02,199
just to coordinates whatever charges you

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:05,020
may have already understand that there

00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:10,290
are some issues and in the end

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:13,000
sleepy itself is we would need more

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,350
flexibility so in when I really need to

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,870
want to support for the automatic

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,360
insertion and in format which is not one

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,640
of the existing one and even when the

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,420
support for example that will be added

00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,400
or not see which are must I start things

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,070
that were added that work somehow

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:34,690
changes and that's not of course you in

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:36,730
doctor in in the shorter the wiki

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:41,290
translations it would be good many teams

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:43,120
are expressive exactly it's not so

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,720
difficult we will just need the

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:51,210
extension extension export to get past

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,110
and plate of course that means that

00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,840
implemented we will meet one as

00:16:53,110 --> 00:17:02,800
important to the strictest respectively

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:06,060
this point but in general the the

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,920
extraction processes be complicated this

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:12,550
episode we have this imperative model

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,579
Yahoo explicit the finish this addition

00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,740
for the messages in the code to the

00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:19,990
messages of the stage you have to say

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,800
about the facilities here and there is

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:29,050
some complicit in these rules or some

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:33,430
other files and one and this is not nice

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:36,620
from an informant a nice one to you so

00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:39,170
there will be for example also

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,630
Kurama which Bible that hands to

00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:44,000
ex-partners that the translation for

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,980
very satisfied so instead of any

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,840
messages of this changed by you that

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,420
these magic things that you thought were

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,630
in analytically takes our population

00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,880
file and do the magic for all the ties

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:59,420
to find their biscuits moving to a

00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,430
bigger vision what is available and what

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,740
not and that will have both release

00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,720
great skills not release a lot of

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,180
guessing the biscuit needs to do to

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,370
understand or to in a parable but that

00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,670
would simplify this a lot and that

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,620
brings you up the scary part so

00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:18,950
reliability which is something you don't

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:22,940
want to do you know just one shot Sweden

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:25,460
we should go because so the problem that

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,770
I explained in previous like the first

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:31,550
step can be done independently hundred

00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:35,450
twenty two and we'll clean up some party

00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:38,210
sweetie this right now disabuse it's a

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:40,309
is the sleepy deflection and keeping a

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,550
lot of bashful emergency response

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:51,350
programs all together that's why other

00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:55,610
things there is no I don't mean I have

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:58,160
to be shy but I don't know I personally

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:00,470
will be to my party in surround

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,299
billboard which is a engine and

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:06,169
Jenny's things but we didn't invite them

00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:09,530
to drive the evolution steps to send

00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:12,159
them over is required anyone don't want

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:15,140
to do like having it in one shot and

00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,659
another things which is it's painful bit

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:21,679
less than gatherers without letting go

00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:24,380
of the Bastille when the team translated

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:29,480
women - um so speak to the dimension and

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:32,000
do stuff from dog food to your face but

00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,610
then the part where you take the po5

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:41,419
translate the confession we can explore

00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:43,940
and regeneration the automation is still

00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:46,070
possible but that record is so I didn't

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,990
investigate it too much even when I do

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:53,150
we generate money there are some

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,890
templates we turn to the data that could

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,840
be some English stuff that shouldn't

00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,230
sleep in so something that needs to be

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,860
redone that's a good sign that it's not

00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:08,080
part of the other bigger changes and

00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:08,080
sometimes this is connected to some

00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:27,100
branches most of the teams are abilities

00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:27,100
but sometimes we miss something and some

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:36,140
moving the service but we need 12 when

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:39,710
we are assessed at Wilson before and in

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:42,320
Korea commit our translational side is

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,040
made up aging issue called the research

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,650
and

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,270
system and that's why the transaction

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,390
took place on Tuesday morning on

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,160
Wednesday morning at works later there

00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,720
is not a sufficient system that's the

00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,700
reason why you had was somebody that in

00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:00,830
five or six different reservation system

00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:04,370
which contains to define which there is

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:08,210
working on the same because my friend is

00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:11,150
with us to read a PDF Silva at some

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:14,030
point I think my proposal at this point

00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:18,140
just to teach to dumb it lies which the

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:20,360
you know transaction website is written

00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,450
in Java or Python and it should be easy

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:27,740
to Allah so that work easier than

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,760
providing everything from scratch I even

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,090
try to installation

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:36,080
it should be quite possible but again

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:38,030
when Martha and most of the other end

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,170
points proposal many times

00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:45,830
no there is no people really against it

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:48,980
but it's not social for some issues like

00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:52,600
habit metarex in completely we go in

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:57,680
with my process transactions but I still

00:21:52,600 --> 00:22:00,440
needs to implement a few points that

00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,950
this is a meaning from two years ago it

00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:08,080
was the last plan about this basically

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,080
shouldn't tooth shouldn't go in the way

00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:09,530
but basically future for the plasma

00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:14,030
Bangkok's an application at least they

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:17,990
state they are not so bad

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:22,400
so even with the Lockman power the few

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:25,850
people that are doing busted the the

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,800
fermentation is mostly within you which

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:32,180
is an assignment for me except you

00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:35,080
should know just in case speed automatic

00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,080
starting the

00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,840
like giving in to some a litter box and

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,940
that the translator has explained it

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:47,190
before regenerated to induction for each

00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:52,080
document the website is having the front

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:56,940
end using mobile web developers but the

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,760
website generated really PNG which will

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:05,070
generate seeds and searching search

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:08,310
engine where religion and the I working

00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:14,880
so I just need some poop clean under the

00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:18,030
website the challenges this time hello

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,830
people soon we use non dog even I'm not

00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:22,980
sure for the increase the number of the

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:26,280
condition too much facility even in many

00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,510
other open source projects people so are

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,900
possible

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:33,120
an alternative should be nice my

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,390
proposal is asked lot because it's

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,390
closer to God it should be easier to

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:42,010
just help you start to come back who can

00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:46,970
really sing

00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:49,070
changing just one shot and even in these

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,110
days that working prototype soon to be

00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:55,309
implemented hospital is another matter

00:24:51,110 --> 00:25:00,440
like text native format like McDow or

00:24:55,309 --> 00:25:02,480
rst and other methods we are our

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,399
challenge which is coming at any

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,799
questions of the new license which is

00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:08,840
totally fine the u.s. is fine there was

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:14,929
discussion about changing to create

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:17,960
forum for four different license it's

00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:20,870
not a fan it's totally nice but I fear

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,909
that if we switch to new documents we

00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:26,090
need to do a lot of work to realizes the

00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:35,929
augmentation we want to still use it and

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:37,730
use it on time so Sony's the ways the

00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:41,210
website as I mentioned before the

00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:44,570
mechanism was rewritten we need to do

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:46,460
the front end something nice something

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:52,090
like that advantages would be actually

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:56,230
inside like language and different

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:58,940
vessels on the fly in such changes in

00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:02,600
new generation of the condition to work

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:05,080
that's inside back to that and even if

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:10,720
the ban has allowed to keep the to keep

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,720
all the branches by all persons plasma

00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,840
that piece of dough is missing so there

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,970
was one reason for a body in the street

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:24,210
but I saw it at that point and I think

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:26,070
more or less we're fine and we have some

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,650
time for some questions those are the

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:33,920
coordinates it is you want to compare

00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:39,000
the team both concessions in the XI team

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:40,910
both on the many ways and highest

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,010
channels

00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:46,620
Sharon question and here and the winner

00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,820
both for translation or for Monday but

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:53,270
remember the time is very interested and

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,270
your questions

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,649
no question

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,649
