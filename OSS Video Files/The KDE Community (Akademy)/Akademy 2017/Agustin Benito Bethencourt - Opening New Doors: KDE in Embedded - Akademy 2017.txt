Title: Agustin Benito Bethencourt - Opening New Doors: KDE in Embedded - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Automotive and other tradition embedded industries are moving beyond their traditional role as Open Source consumers only. KDE project might have an interesting role to play if we open ourselves to this sector. This talk will describe why is such an interest move for the project and what challenges we will face on the journey.

On October 2016, while being in charge of the GENIVI Development Platform for automotive, Agustin wrote an article about the opportunity that represents for KDE the automotive sector today. This is true for other embedded industries that lack a "desktop" and applications done in the open to supports the different platform development efforts. The opportunity is even greater if we look at embedded as a collection of industries that are currently in early stages in terms of Open Source development practices. Big players are investing effort in supporting R&D projects in the open and they know very little about us. And those who do know about KDE, limit our efforts, technologies and focus on "non-touch" screens.

From the variety of distribution efforts that bring bring Open Source to embedded, Agustin finds particularly interesting the Yocto project, the most popular "distribution effort" within embedded nowadays. Other projects like Buildstream have interest too.

Today Agustin is involved in the development of another automotive platform, driven by the Linux Foundation (AGL), that is getting momentum and has a weak equivalent solution compared to Plasma. The same applies to the very limited set of applications, specially if we compare them with what KDE might offer.

Agustin will describe why embedded Linux represents such an opportunity for KDE, what are the areas we should look at and what are the main challenges we need to overcome. Another interesting topic is the synergies that such a move would bring with the Qt community.

	00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,459
and now we have a lightning talk about

00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:15,849
the prospects of Katy in automotive and

00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:21,760
other embedded

00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:23,259
Linda's applications course I was Dean

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,779
Augustine okay

00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:30,730
yes teach yours okay thank you for the

00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:38,890
organizers to allow me to to have a few

00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:44,850
minutes with you there used to be a time

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:49,120
in which Katie had a lot of impact a

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,440
time in which the desktop was awesome

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,480
right everybody was talking about the

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:59,079
desktop in Linux and yeah it was a small

00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:05,770
world but we were in the core part of

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:07,810
that world and today still the desktop

00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,520
and Katie is very important obviously

00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:14,619
for all of us it's in the center of our

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,570
hearts and despite the fact that today

00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:19,060
we have a better software than ever that

00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:22,180
we have more experience than ever that

00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:25,120
our community is more solid probably

00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:30,340
than ever it was before that we do a few

00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,930
things extremely well somehow the focus

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,320
of the software industry the open source

00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:37,810
industry somewhere else

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,530
so we rock but our music is not hurt

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,900
anymore

00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:51,030
by most people out there so yeah we

00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:55,510
still rock right we do so thinking about

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:58,049
how we can put Katie back into the

00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:02,229
center the core the focus right bringing

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:04,840
attention for others and and show all

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:07,060
that cool stuff that we do and have

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,319
again a lot of impact not just in our

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,659
own world but also beyond that I was

00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,810
thinking about for for some time and

00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:18,610
those of you who know me I've been

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,180
fighting for some years for instance to

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:25,150
go to the corporate desktop and fight a

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,670
lot for for promoting the kiosk mode and

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,930
other things so I was thinking okay look

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,840
we need to find

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,849
these plays in which we can go and we

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,280
are alone there and it's so cool that we

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,049
can even swim completely naked right we

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,599
can because we are the only ones there

00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:42,430
so so we can really enjoy right and

00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,650
bring back some excitement but it gets

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,420
at the very end as a group you need a

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:51,370
lot of excitement not just internal

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:56,469
excitement but also external one so I've

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:58,989
been working the last year and a half in

00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:01,389
automotive basically doing consulting in

00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:04,030
processes how to build distros and how

00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:06,519
to be efficient in the software delivery

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,519
and I want to explain you into three

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:13,750
minutes why I think automotive could be

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,609
a great place for us to be and what has

00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,389
changed or is changing in the automotive

00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:21,879
industry that what it used to be

00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:25,419
impossible environment for us it's

00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:27,159
becoming possible environment and will

00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:32,409
be common might become a great

00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:35,549
environment for us so how to Mari if

00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:39,459
it's going through a disruptive

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:43,169
transformation just like we know we

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:45,970
lived in some other industries before

00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:48,669
I'm not I don't have time for going

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,590
through the details but everything that

00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:52,870
it's happening out emotive we have seen

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,419
it in one way or the other

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,699
in previous disruptive transformations

00:03:55,419 --> 00:04:04,720
in other industries especially when we

00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:08,889
think about in open source so now that

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,590
we have gone through the process of that

00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:16,060
disruption in other industries what I

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:18,070
believe is that and many many

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:20,500
open-source people that are somehow

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,780
involved in in in automotive believe is

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,919
that there is an opportunity there for

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:33,639
people like us and like always happen if

00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:35,229
you hit first you hit twice so one of

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,849
the things that are very very important

00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,740
that has changed in the last couple of

00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:41,800
years in automotive is that now there

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,740
are open collaborative ecosystems that

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,000
are trying

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,319
to create assets code not just code but

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,509
also called

00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,479
together in a collaborative and open way

00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:55,090
with open source licenses and that was

00:04:53,479 --> 00:05:00,190
not there before

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:02,449
so those ecosystems are places in which

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,130
individual developers can play obviously

00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,060
if you work for companies you can play

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,160
also bad foundations or associations

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:14,210
communities like us can play too that

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,979
was not there before they are basically

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,830
two that I would like to mention because

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,270
I've been involved in in both of them in

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,090
one way or the other

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,909
and yeah I would like you to take a look

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,970
because they are creating iin carrying

00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:31,220
the KDS pain talk the Academy has talked

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:37,250
I show a Raspberry Pi 3 with a

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:40,340
touchscreen and prototype an R&D system

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,830
for automotive that is being created in

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,990
this case for a GL and it is being used

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:53,710
in the R&D department some of some of

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:53,710
the OEMs that are part of echo system so

00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:59,930
and also one very attractive point is

00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:04,669
that these environments are full of

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:06,530
potential investors in KDE and they are

00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:12,500
putting in these environments millions

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:16,130
of dollars for to make developers like

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,139
us to create technologies that they

00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:24,530
might use or my not in the coming three

00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:27,259
to five years an interesting point is

00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:31,699
that in our money if Q is the number one

00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:33,830
tool kit so it's a place in which we can

00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,810
go there and not talk about cute we

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,880
don't need to sell cute we just need to

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,000
sell what we do at KDE because Q is

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:44,810
already there the interesting point so

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,550
the following question is so why do cute

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,620
knitters right and there is an

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,320
interesting point there in terms of the

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,930
license because as you know and we were

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,930
part of that right Q change the license

00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:01,389
towards gplv3

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:04,300
model gplv3 based model and as we have

00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:07,210
seen in other industries with gplv2 for

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,850
instance the reaction of the industry

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,130
towards openness in terms of license is

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,470
always very negative exactly like it

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,389
happens in other industries before that

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:20,070
reaction came in to the automotive

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:23,940
industry and they have basically banned

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:26,979
gplv3 based code and models right so

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,820
cute now has a challenge in this open

00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:33,610
environment and it's a it's a battle in

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,900
which we can really really help so there

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:40,840
is an I see as a need for cute to have

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,550
something like KDE going there working

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,280
there and helping fight the battle a

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,760
battle that in other words they're gonna

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,979
lose anyway just exactly the same thing

00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,710
happened a few years ago again with the

00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:56,110
gplv2 kind based licenses they're gonna

00:07:53,710 --> 00:08:02,620
lose that battle it's just that we can

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:04,630
help to fight it and you know in this

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,940
open environments all these companies I

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,169
I always put the case of the Japanese

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,000
companies because they are they're

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,280
getting really really involved basically

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,030
they are learning about open source so

00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:19,539
they are using those environments to put

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:23,919
engineers there to try to get them out

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:26,380
of these left behind kind of attitude

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,389
that they have they understand that they

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,580
need to change their heavy open source

00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:32,380
consumers now they are trying to take

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,839
their steps from being consumers to be

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,000
in producers to be in contributors and

00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,880
they see these environments as learning

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,650
ecosystems so we have an opportunity

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,580
there to do something that we do really

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,910
really well

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:51,760
mentoring helping others to get into

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:55,830
open source and one of the key goals of

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,480
this environments is to create

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:01,180
ecosystems of application developers

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,190
one of the main needs that audience and

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:07,450
Taiwan's in the automotive industry see

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,520
is that in five three five years they

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,100
will have to increase the

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,250
number of features that they provide to

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,250
the consumers in the cars and there are

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,380
not enough applications out there or

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,960
developers working on applications for

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,150
automotive so they're one of the main

00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,450
goals of these ecosystems is creating

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,740
those ecosystem did those conditions for

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,390
application developers to come that's

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:37,080
why they are investing so heavily in

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:39,820
SDKs and we are exactly that we are

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:44,050
nothing but an ecosystem of application

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:47,740
developers in some in some sense so in

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:50,950
many ways our nature our values our

00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:58,750
goals match with what they want what

00:09:50,950 --> 00:10:02,470
they need so if tomorrow I will tomorrow

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:05,500
yes tomorrow maybe tomorrow if not

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,300
Monday I will bring that raspberry pie

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,350
that I brought to the to the academia

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,820
yes and you will see how how much

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,700
everything related with the UI Sox I

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,830
mean it's such big time I'm amazed that

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,810
any developer has really developed that

00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,040
and put it there and now they are

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:23,140
showing it all over the world

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,160
believe me seen four or five hundred

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:31,270
people in a private event in the CES in

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,280
in Las Vegas freaking out with the this

00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,350
kind of system with this kind of layouts

00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,780
it's something hard to digest

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,980
we really can kick some butts there so

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,660
yeah I will bring it I will show it to

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,630
you and you probably will freak out the

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:50,290
semi means like we can do very well in

00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:56,770
that kind of environment so I see that

00:10:50,290 --> 00:11:00,420
as a way to get in there and bring back

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,740
some attention based on what we do best

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,310
we would have to learn a few things

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,470
obviously the whole ecosystem is

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:12,040
learning about open source so we will

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:16,420
find that not everything is perfect in

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,800
many ways but they are committed to go

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,480
into the right direction

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,130
at least in these are in the

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,810
environments that production is a

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,360
different story but we

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,480
again it it's nothing very different to

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,100
what happened some years ago in in

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,380
different industries right you start

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,240
with R&D trying to share cost in R&D and

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,940
then that rolls out that open-source

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,220
model runs out into production first you

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,200
think that you can control it and then

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,630
you realize that the model controls you

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,490
and then you adapt your business models

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:52,840
to this new model so working on this

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:56,260
24/7 I see a great place to start with

00:11:52,840 --> 00:12:00,190
today and he hit hard hit twice so that

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,610
was basically my message and thank you

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,610
for listening

00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,000
[Music]

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:16,570
we have questions so so as I understand

00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:18,610
that the mission of your talk is to to

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,040
inspire us and want us to do these

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:25,180
things and I think many in the audience

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,410
probably you got that point across I

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,090
think probably many people in the

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,910
audience feel that's something maybe we

00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,470
should do and that's a good idea

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:35,830
the problem is when they now will leave

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,180
this room and they take it with them we

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,730
should do that but they don't know

00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,470
exactly how to go about that so what are

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,810
the concrete steps we need to take what

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,180
are the work items what should we be

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:49,890
doing who will take point on that okay

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:53,410
that was not just us that was part of my

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:55,120
in academia so I had like half hour or

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,410
45 minutes so I had a couple of slides

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,820
of the first step let me let me

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:03,370
summarize that very quickly in embedded

00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,290
and I'm not sure it's going to last very

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,090
look for very long but in embedded they

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,220
used the clarity of operatic systems

00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:12,010
right so and there are a couple of them

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,860
that are quite popular the most popular

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,270
probably will not right now see octo so

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,580
for those who come from the package

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,460
management based operating systems or

00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:24,880
distros it's it is that there is a

00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,020
learning curve so cute is well maintain

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,020
it there obviously there is a huge

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,900
business model around your toad cute we

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:34,090
should get there with Katie not with

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,160
everything but at least enough so we can

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,050
create demos

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,120
to start to bring attention and also

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,129
learn from our side that's one point and

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,250
the second point is we have to go

00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:47,290
through several - we have to take the

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,940
journey to get into this kind of

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:52,660
ecosystems see how its seeing how they

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,980
work what are how we can fit there what

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,259
kind of applications might be

00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:01,360
interesting that will make a hit quite

00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:03,699
easily and then there is a lot of

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,889
mindset also and there it has always

00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:07,829
been like very restricted because we

00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:10,060
think it's very close right but

00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:12,759
especially in automotive now

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,709
connectivity comes in place and we know

00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,839
for example from the server world first

00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:19,750
or from the mobile world that when

00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:23,709
connectivity came everything changes so

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:25,660
what today we know as automotive or what

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,269
yesterday we thought it was out of more

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,029
if it's not going to be the same so and

00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:32,579
so if we are we need to understand that

00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:35,079
they are going through a process that

00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:37,149
might end up would like the mobile world

00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:38,410
or may end up like the enterprise world

00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:42,459
or might end up in a completely

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:45,220
different way so most of the people here

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:47,019
when they approach this kind of new

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,209
environments is you know if it's not

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,130
fully open if the rules are not fully

00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:54,009
clear I don't want to get in

00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:57,610
we don't yeah we need to understand the

00:14:54,009 --> 00:15:00,009
situation how they are going and and get

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,130
the attitude of let's help them shape it

00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:05,079
so this end up in a different way that

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,329
the mobile has ended and it looks like

00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:09,759
more like the enterprise world so I

00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:13,810
think those three points are and I have

00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:15,880
another three or four I can I can I can

00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:18,069
describe them in the slides I can put

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,459
the Spanish lights or or just even

00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:23,470
translate them so how about we we pick

00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:26,290
some sort of industry event in that

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,660
domain and we try to get a boost there

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,970
and then we figure out what do we want

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,550
to show there what actual things do we

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,730
need to create to have that to show and

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:39,250
then show it and talk to people yes it's

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:42,370
the industry events they are like to

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,620
three different classes right the Linux

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,860
one very focused on Linux those are easy

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,760
to reach for us Linux Foundation three

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:53,000
GL or the Geneva Alliance

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,280
be more than happy to host us there so

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,710
we can show what we do it would be

00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,600
showing it on top of their distro

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,360
basically yeah and then there is a

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,460
second type of events which are industry

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,590
events that are very focused on specific

00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,310
areas related with software now what are

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:12,710
most driving is very important those

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:16,370
it's gonna take us a little it's a

00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,960
little harder to get there but if we go

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,760
through the first step

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,520
maybe they help us to get there also

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,960
there are companies that are like like

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,460
the one I work and others that are

00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,770
getting into that are in into that

00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,210
industry I think that the cuticle system

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,740
would be also very interesting to take

00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,660
us there because they are already going

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,600
there there is a third type which are

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:38,120
fairs and well I'm not sure that's very

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,550
interesting for us at the beginning

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,190
well then let's pick one of the Linux

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,740
ones package frameworks for the distro

00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,780
got plasma shell running on it and take

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,430
a system there and show it and talk to

00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,400
people about what the framework I would

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,990
love to see a couple of Engineers and I

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,110
definitely will help with everything I

00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:59,420
have it's okay it's it's it's something

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,580
what we can really do and it's not that

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,699
hard it I mean it's not that hard

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:07,579
Yocto is not an easy it's not an easy

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:11,240
one especially coming from the this

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:13,010
distro that works going through Yocto

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,230
it's a different story but hey the

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,720
embedded guys that love that thing

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,150
because it the world was really awful

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:25,910
for them before that that you have to

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:28,010
think game so yeah ok thanks when you

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,770
say Yocto is hard do you mean the like

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:34,010
the governance of getting your own metal

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,390
yo-yo to maya in my opinion and if there

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,440
is somebody from Intel here probably

00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:42,230
wouldn't agree with me Giotto is very

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,810
expensive to maintain yeah because I've

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,540
been working on Yocto for the last six

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:51,280
months and I wouldn't say it it's that

00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,280
stupid learning curve so

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,970
yeah okay so it's it's very expensive to

00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,360
maintain that's something they are

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,930
working on but today it's it's a huge

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,930
challenge

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:14,800
go ahead I was gonna ask um what do you

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:17,530
think if instead of the automotive

00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,470
industry losing their resistance to GPL

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,130
3 they decide to buy commercial licenses

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,960
for keed

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,300
which is obviously great for the key

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,640
ecosystem because it brings in money to

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,480
the Q company and we all benefit from

00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,540
that on the other hand how would the kkd

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,850
software free software fit in if if

00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,620
those automotive companies are using

00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:49,540
commercial licenses and still avoiding

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:52,810
the GPL 3 ok um they basically how I see

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:58,020
it all insuring in a few words they the

00:18:52,810 --> 00:19:01,720
cute model is if in terms of license and

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,910
that could create some debate as I see

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,980
it is either you contribute back with

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:12,160
code or you contribute back with money

00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:16,660
right so on the commercial side we want

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,210
Q to be a sustainable project right so

00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:22,600
it makes sense that people contribute

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,610
back with money but given the amount of

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,870
software and innovation that it's coming

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,390
and especially will come into the

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,490
automotive industry a lot of their

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,190
innovation is not going to happen inside

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:36,340
the companies it's going to happen in

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:39,610
open environments where a lot of

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,860
companies and volunteers share that

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,660
exactly the same that happens in the

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,930
enterprise world it needs to happen like

00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,350
that

00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:49,210
it seemed it's there are no googles none

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,400
of them they are getting into they are

00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,070
turning into changing and getting

00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,440
becoming software companies but there

00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:59,530
are no googles so that's not going to

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,990
happen in my opinion so in in those

00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:05,170
environments the gplv3 model is a very

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:07,300
good one so I see that

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,120
as in I see ourselves feeling in those

00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:14,950
are in the environments in the same way

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:20,740
that companies are not shipping KD

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:23,200
software in their corporate desktops we

00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,510
can make a very nice living without

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,050
having our software shipped in our cars

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:31,360
and and when I see our software I mean

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,740
the applications right but because there

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,260
are a lot of software that we do

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,840
incorporate desktops are there a lot of

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:40,450
software is just that it doesn't have

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,640
the stamp of Katies so it's in my apply

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,650
but then we get higher by those

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,810
companies those companies finance back

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,430
their projects somehow allow people to

00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:52,000
come to these kind of events I mean

00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:54,190
there is a lot of value in being visible

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,950
and play act and active role in our in

00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:59,260
the environments and get back maybe

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:02,440
maybe our role is not to get a KDE

00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:05,710
desktop in a car maybe that's part of

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:08,500
the how you define sucks I had talked a

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,610
community Kino right into 2012 defining

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,030
what is success

00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:14,770
maybe the success should not be to have

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:22,210
KDE desktop in the car

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:27,220
maybe so I guess we can wrap this

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:28,570
session up here we're actually running

00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,470
about five minutes late for the next

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:40,710
session which is which is the last one

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:40,710
for the day so sorry yeah

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,589
