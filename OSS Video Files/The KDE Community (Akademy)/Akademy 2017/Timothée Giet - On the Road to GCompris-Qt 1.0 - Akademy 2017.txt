Title: TimothÃ©e Giet - On the Road to GCompris-Qt 1.0 - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	This talk is about the recent activity in GCompris, the issues we faced, and how the community can join us.

During the last year a lot of things happened in GCompris. We finally officially shipped the new Qt-based version instead of the old one, and people are mostly happy with it.

In this talk, I'd like to show the progress we made, and some shiny new activities. I'll also talk about the few issues that some users have been facing with the new version compared to the old one. We found workarounds for some issues, but a few are inevitable.

We are slowly getting closer to 1.0, but there is still some big work to do. I'll try to summarize the remaining tasks, and point to the parts where the community can help.

you for being here so my name is Timothy

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,330
jet I'm

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:19,040
primary graphic artist and I started

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,830
learning hacking and coding to

00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:27,689
contribute to free software and I get

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,509
got started in KDE since 2010 with my

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:34,580
contribution to quitter and I got

00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:42,210
started in the country in 2014

00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:47,430
mainly with graphics update on the G

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:50,519
country so what is Japan thing for those

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,559
who don't know Japan P is big collection

00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:57,690
of activities for children from 2 to 10

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,659
probably or even more and it's

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,839
educational activities and used in many

00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:08,760
schools and available and every

00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:14,369
platforms now thanks to cute it was

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:17,450
originally written in gtk+ being ported

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:21,600
to cute quite at the same time when I

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:25,770
before I started contributing and it was

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,850
the main reason to do the graphics we do

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,530
all the graphics so a lot of same

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,980
happened in the last year I tried to

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,060
summarize quickly the main point so in

00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:42,680
August last year we released

00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:46,080
0.61 with six new activities but then

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,680
bad thing happen is that the video could

00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,500
one with the Creator and has been the

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,890
maintainer for objects in place since

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,250
the beginning in 2000 it's very quite

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,370
old software already and he changed job

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,520
and didn't have any anymore time to keep

00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:08,190
maintaining the country so he had to

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,790
leave this big big task to me and Johnny

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:17,879
jazz X which he who is the the biggest

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:20,040
contributor at the time so we share the

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,620
tasks of journey does most of the

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,010
community management and a lot of

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,200
code review and when he has time in code

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,049
new activities well I'll do all the

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,629
graphical work and I'm in charge now the

00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:36,330
commercial activity that Bruno was in

00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,280
charge before and doing all the

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,099
communication on the website and the

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:47,849
social media which I'm just starting to

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:50,370
get to to get him to besides all the

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,159
other tasks we share them as we can

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,410
like back PC fix that fix is release

00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:59,790
planning and packaging so of course

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,519
thanks to the community we have several

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,609
contributors and especially with the

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,459
season of KDE and google Summer of Code

00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:13,170
that we have great students and a few

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:14,870
mentors helping us often for this year

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,220
the google Summer of Code we have a

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:22,620
contributor called Emmanuel who is

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:27,750
helping us mentoring and so here are a

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:30,030
few of the activities added in 0 61 so

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,950
you see we had a baby word processor

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,790
graph graph coloring photo hunter

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,560
explore monuments and tangram and an

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,859
activity called one save where you

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,340
control a spaceship I'll show you some

00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:46,500
screenshots quickly with Instagram while

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,250
you well you probably know what is a

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,709
10-gram you just put the shapes the

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,910
simple shapes to form more complex one

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:59,579
and the baby what processor to get

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:05,370
started learning how what processor is

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:11,370
working with very minimum features this

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:16,680
is find a different activity this one is

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:20,280
the unsaved and graph coloring and the

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,889
monuments of the world also we for this

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,190
release I read all the workings of the

00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:28,000
chess activity which is now much nicer

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:33,100
and therefore

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,190
hangman also which is Morphin and this

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:38,770
one also is a horizontal and vertical

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,990
reading were a bunch of words are

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:45,400
displayed vertically or horizontally and

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:48,040
the child lies to find if the displayed

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,180
word is if the given word is displayed

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:55,810
on this page so that was what is release

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,310
and I mean after that we just before

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,880
Christmas last year

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,190
we could release 0 70 wins again April

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,120
activities and so the very very

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:08,320
important food is because it was

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,820
advanced discipline that we officially

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,070
dropped the old gtk version to use the

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,380
short version for every platforms

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,710
because until then

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:25,210
especially in Windows we provided the GT

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:27,580
version still but the thing that pushed

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,070
really for this moon is that since being

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,340
left there is now no one from the team

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:35,590
we worked on the GTA version so it's

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,370
impossible to provide support for us on

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:42,850
it so even if we don't have yet a full

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:46,720
parity with the previous version it made

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:49,660
sense to replicate it and so at the same

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,020
time I did a big we did a big website

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:58,030
update because the website of G country

00:05:53,020 --> 00:06:01,840
dotnet is generated with Python scripts

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:07,060
and ginger true templates and fetching

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,070
data and translation from the source

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,310
code from the application which make it

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:18,310
easier to maintain it but also made it

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:20,500
harder to yeah to transfer the the

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:25,470
content to the new version it required a

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:30,340
bit of work so the new activities in

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,220
0:17 or draw letters or numbers build a

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,350
similar

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,590
letter in which word the nine memories

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:39,440
for one m2 player and activity code

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:43,460
share the counties and Roman numerals so

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:49,840
quickly here is the building same wall

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,840
where you have to move the letters or

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:57,290
other kinds of images to replicate a

00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,870
given pattern you can see we added some

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,150
buttons to control it but you can use a

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:07,160
keyboard or touch input that's something

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:12,170
we try hardly - well good efforts to

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:14,500
give as much control different control

00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:18,440
available to make it more accessible to

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:21,110
as much people as possible so we always

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,460
provide keyboards and mouse and touch

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:30,710
input for every activities

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:34,390
she's draw number two writers name in

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:38,330
movies where you have to align three

00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:41,090
dots from the same core this is

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:43,669
shadowkhan DS which I just started to me

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:48,500
due to graphics and where you have a

00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:51,770
given number of people and given number

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:57,860
of items that you have to share again

00:07:51,770 --> 00:08:00,260
and women number where you a child learn

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:07,580
to convert Roman number to very big

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:10,600
number so for 2017 this year we are

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,700
waving preparing the release zero 80

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,060
which is almost ready and should be

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:20,900
really dishonest with six new activities

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:23,750
and much more graphics updates since I

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,870
could now work almost phota

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:29,860
work almost full-time on it I'm getting

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,860
yeah

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:39,550
well I can work more on the graphics and

00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,830
just before realizing it we still need

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:45,880
to fix of to crash and packaging is you

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,860
come back to it after so in this version

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,500
we have the bar game one and two player

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,440
yes count categorization and the

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:57,330
checkers classic checkers game again one

00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,870
in two players so this is categorization

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:04,900
that consumer of cod student work done

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:06,730
where you have a different at the

00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,340
beginning of the activity you can select

00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:18,070
different kinds of topics and then you

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:20,670
have to find if the image is in this

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:25,210
category or not

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:28,360
yes comment is yeah an activity where

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:31,600
children have to recreate an operation

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:36,580
with operators in number to reach a

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:42,160
certain count and our game is a simple

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:44,590
activity where you place boys on the bar

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:50,890
and you must not be the last one to

00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:53,560
place the ball on the 15th case and the

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:58,350
checkers which looks a lot like the

00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:01,450
chest but bit different so the

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:05,260
activities but about the issues we have

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:08,680
had we've had quite a lot of issues to

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,650
get started on and on sadly I still have

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:16,230
a lot of users on was tech on XP area

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:19,210
especially on the third world countries

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,760
we a lot of schools have old computers

00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,890
and for some reason just stuck on well

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,400
Windows XP do so in this case the best

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,050
we can do is provide the old GTA version

00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,200
can try to convince them to switch to

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:34,590
Linux on those computers that we can do

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,590
much more

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,440
to pick on inverses GPU drivers bags

00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:46,139
yeah but that's really

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:49,079
because we are now forced to force the

00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:51,570
software to use software OpenGL because

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,389
a lot of people have welcomed drivers

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,699
and the software crash right when you

00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:58,529
launch it so the only work around we

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:02,370
found except telling the people to

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:05,160
update their drivers is to force it for

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:10,199
everyone because even is the automatic

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:13,889
selection still crashes so maybe you'll

00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:16,920
find another better walk around and the

00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:20,699
third big point he issue is immune

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:25,380
disease the Microsoft compiler of

00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:28,829
assuming the value for GCC because there

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:32,160
are often crash that happens when you

00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:39,949
when we build with an SBC that doesn't

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:42,750
happen when we mean w but it's to build

00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,860
since she doesn't provide any more

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,019
64-bits

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,870
packages by default so we have to build

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:54,810
cute and then build she country so it's

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:58,260
a bit more annoying for me I found out

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:02,370
yesterday that do crushes we had an SVC

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:05,639
don't happen anymore with cute v dot 9.1

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,990
so we are still wondering if which would

00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,690
package

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,029
release with a militiaman w we not

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,180
decided yet

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:17,430
so that was for Windows then on Linux

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:20,190
the situation is a bit better but the

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,500
issue is with the distribution there is

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:25,500
really huge distribution that packaged

00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,130
the latest the completed version like a

00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,790
phoenix

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:32,760
magia open SUSE and Kelly Union that's

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:39,260
the me before only that I found that had

00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:42,870
the latest version when he said and you

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,259
still have an old 0.5 version which is

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,769
two years ago

00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:49,749
so it's not very nice and so we provide

00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:52,959
the standard version which is set

00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:55,059
extractable and a standalone version for

00:12:52,959 --> 00:13:08,559
which should work on every Linux

00:12:55,059 --> 00:13:10,269
distribution but it's still deep yes I

00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,429
said the standalone version still

00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:16,149
depends too much on the the system

00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:19,239
libraries especially on GStreamer and we

00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:21,999
have to choose between gstreamer 0.10

00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:24,850
and just remember one to support all

00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:30,519
distribution or recent ones and we

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:32,859
didn't I'm not really a way to work

00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:38,709
around that with this kind of installer

00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:41,709
so we allege to me

00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:45,160
he has a flat-pack package so we will

00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:48,579
try to make it more official but it's

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,649
still required the flat pack on the

00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:53,369
distribution so it won't work for all

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:56,799
the older distribution but it can be

00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:59,079
compromised to have the assault

00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,759
extractable which support all

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:04,959
distribution and the flat pack for

00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:07,799
recent one we in consumption when not

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,799
decided yet either

00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:18,009
this word platform with issues is Apple

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:20,109
platforms on Mac OS X and iOS the

00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:24,699
problem is the packages were not been

00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:27,100
updated since 0.52 because Bruno did the

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:30,220
packages and the one in the team has a

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:35,409
Mac anymore so we can't do much more and

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:38,019
we were depending on volunteers to help

00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:42,130
us for now until someone can afford a

00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:44,050
Mac and want to buy a Mac

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:48,090
hopefully one punch one volunteer

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:55,720
contacted us few weeks ago but didn't

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:57,490
made any working package yet so yeah we

00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,850
don't know when we will be the next

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:04,720
release version for those platforms but

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:07,750
what we know is for OS 6 we want to host

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,050
it on de comprar dotnet because it does

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:16,930
not make more any sense anymore to host

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:18,100
it on the Apple App Store 406 at least

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:22,150
but for iOS

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:25,030
well we probably probably know that the

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:28,120
hub story is still mandatory so it's

00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:31,060
much more annoying to deploy it and it

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:35,500
requires more organization and more

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:39,190
costly and history shows that that

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:43,270
actually does not that much people

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:47,530
wanting to buy it on ipad so it's maybe

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:54,610
not really worth the effort so that's

00:15:47,530 --> 00:16:01,480
why it didn't move from 0:52 then our

00:15:54,610 --> 00:16:05,980
goals for version 1.0 we have we really

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:08,440
want to have version 1.0 to full parity

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,980
with the old version which means having

00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,990
working administration panel which was a

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:17,020
very important feature especially for

00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:20,890
the screens which allow to administrate

00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:25,510
a food class and see what they do give

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:27,400
them customized activities and do work

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,920
for this administration Taniya started

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:34,540
but they are still like at least a year

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,150
of work to make it we equivalent to what

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:40,450
we had in GT campus and then we are

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,520
still missing activities that were in

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,800
the old version

00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,310
mmm but especially two that are

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,060
requested a lot by our users the

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,060
animation activity and

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,879
Digital electricity activity with where

00:16:54,459 --> 00:17:02,980
you learn the digital electric continent

00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:07,270
and how circuit works for this one we

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,280
have another new activity in the crude

00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:13,809
version which is digital electricity

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,789
which is somehow equivalent but bit

00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:19,449
different because it's different kind of

00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:24,130
components but the base can be reused to

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:26,620
do this activity and of course I'd like

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:30,159
to complete the graphics of that because

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:33,520
for now I have only like 1/3 of the

00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:37,179
activities which of the graphics updated

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,890
to the new design guidelines and yeah

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:42,130
that would be my main work for the next

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,380
launches and at least for the main

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:49,150
components because we also have a big

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:53,650
library of images that Bruno's consult

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:57,490
someone to create with thousands of well

00:17:53,650 --> 00:18:02,980
a mother of a thousand I think images so

00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:05,799
this is reused work and I play it and

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:11,860
start on it when all the main components

00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:13,870
have been updated also before this

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,929
version would like to complete no

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:22,030
translations to have as much as the old

00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:24,730
version and also we have read the audio

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:32,590
recording for more languages which for

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:37,179
now we have only a few and other work we

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:42,929
have to do but before and after this one

00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:42,929
the jewelry's is first no website a date

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:57,000
we designed the main note of the website

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:59,830
and adapt well give more content okay

00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,880
the second one is the manual the manual

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,750
is

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,850
and the big work because it barely got

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,960
started the manual on the new version

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:14,200
while we had a very complete one for the

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,049
old version so it can confuse people

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,889
when they found the old manual and look

00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:22,750
for thing putting into it and then they

00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:25,649
realize it's false for the old version

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:28,330
and oh but where's the new manual and

00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:31,960
actually someone started it in latech

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:34,509
but maybe you will not continue in

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:39,429
latech because it's not the easiest way

00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:43,090
to get contributors to the manual so how

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:45,850
can you help for quite anyone you can

00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:49,960
help us first reporting bugs and picture

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,789
requests on the org we still use that

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,580
for the bug reports because it's much

00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:56,830
more convenient to triage user reports

00:19:54,580 --> 00:20:00,519
and then create tasks when required on

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:03,850
topic at all of course and translations

00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:07,539
we need help for translations from all

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:12,340
the world and the voice recordings - and

00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:15,100
we used to have issues to get people to

00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:18,460
get good recording device but with

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:21,580
nowadays smartphones it should be easy

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,509
for most people to record audio and send

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:29,710
it to us and then for developers we need

00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:31,659
oh if you like to help you can help us

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:38,490
by putting one of the missing activities

00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:41,169
or if your expert in the network and

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,379
that kind of stuff you can address on

00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,820
the administration panel if you have

00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:48,220
expert advices it would be already

00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,309
grayed out and even more if you can

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,860
bring some code that would be awesome

00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:56,799
and some how to create an app image and

00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,720
of course to photo Mac and iOS packages

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,529
if you have experience with it we're

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,659
very welcoming you and in any case if

00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:07,629
you want to first comment discuss it on

00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:13,139
IRC on the country channel before doing

00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:13,139
anything and that's all

00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,730
Christian's it's just time

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,330
congratulations on taking over what is

00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:39,279
one of our also flagship applications

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:43,509
and thanks which we should be quite

00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:46,360
proud of having said that how do we know

00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:47,289
we trust you so so shaken pretty has

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,360
been quite successful with the

00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:53,500
commercial activities where it sells on

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,970
app stores and whatnot where is the

00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,009
money going and how do we as a community

00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,580
make sure that you're not just spending

00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:03,389
all in champagne for yourself well under

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:08,139
commercial aspect before I took over

00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:11,860
this it was just well you know getting

00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:13,990
all the income for his work and it's

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:17,440
similar in this way I took over this

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:20,019
online since I'm freelance worker then

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,720
it comes to my income and found me to

00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:25,210
work on it so you can trust me by

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,559
looking at the commits I I do regularly

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:31,659
and I hope to do much more and more and

00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:33,820
more Farah and the other half the

00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:36,009
question was what happens if you fall

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:39,899
under a bus or all the passwords and

00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:42,700
whatnot for that if you if you die today

00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:44,200
what happens to all the accounts for

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,340
that which is a general problem the

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:53,470
thing is hopefully we have I've journey

00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:55,929
as Co maintainer so he will asked him

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:59,200
and he's not interested in taking over

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:03,340
the commercial activity but he has

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:06,850
access also to the the accounts in the

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:10,110
app stores etc so and we know still has

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:14,370
also access to those so we are

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:17,759
distributed who can eat anything happen

00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,759
we started

00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:31,830
I'm actually the traditional Chinese

00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:36,929
generator for chicken fries and they I

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:41,910
also record audio in Academy in 2015

00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:45,480
with Renault but at that time he put

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:49,260
more focus on enjoying version though in

00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:52,590
2015 he rewrites the two companies was

00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:55,350
cute and I know he gave a talk and we

00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,660
talk about oh is this because in we

00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,240
promote free so we're in schools in

00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:04,530
Taiwan and this one is very important

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:08,100
but at that time he put more focus on

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:11,720
enjoy version so the newest version we

00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:16,100
always couldn't get the binary packages

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:20,100
so even for now I still use the old GDK

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,929
regent who put more in schools okay so

00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:26,480
you say you're still using the old GT

00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:29,820
version in the DS version I have

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:34,020
introduced them to the enjoy version

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:37,919
yeah and also for the pay paid versions

00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:41,700
the operation right and but actually I

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:45,480
would like to update our G countries to

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:51,390
the new q the version but I never get

00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:54,799
these binary packages so you we should

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:58,919
talk after to try to pick that yes

00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:04,650
actually I also once considered to do

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:10,380
this for 4G Congress but I didn't yeah

00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:15,650
so do you have any plan that we can get

00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:20,160
any even the static part of gz versions

00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:22,980
for beanies batteries in so that depends

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:26,980
on a lot of system that way but I should

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:30,790
not sure what the real problem is yeah

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,860
very very eager to have a cue diversion

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:38,710
I'm running our reads paths so that we

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:41,590
can reduce them to more people we'll try

00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,240
to work on it if I may add something to

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:45,400
this now that we're pushing for app

00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,650
images and containerized flat packs and

00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,470
stuff like that we could probably try to

00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:53,500
package as you compare as a DMS or a

00:25:50,470 --> 00:26:00,100
flat back this would be accessible to

00:25:53,500 --> 00:26:03,970
more yes that's what I mean so have you

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:06,250
talked to the Debian team about what why

00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,460
they all only packaging the old gtk

00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:13,929
version not anyone not yet but I just

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:16,890
checked it preparing my talk and not is

00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:21,130
that but I will I also don't really know

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:24,460
who to contact and where to get this

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:28,320
kind of feedback so if you have some

00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,320
advice about it I'd be open

00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,590
I'm the Koopa to release manager yep

00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:49,840
this round part of the problem is I just

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:52,539
asked in our develop an Alaia five got

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:57,279
an answer yet it didn't used to be part

00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:59,740
of our package set because it wasn't kte

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:03,340
now that it's KDE yeah and you've had a

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:06,340
KDE release it should become part of our

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:09,970
package set and the same in Debian the

00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:13,149
KDE cute team may not be aware that they

00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:16,059
need to take it over well they have this

00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:19,210
pack this cute version package but an

00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:30,760
old one and I don't know why they didn't

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:36,190
update it I know we would ask does

00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:39,220
anyone have another question okay then I

00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,520
guess we can wrap this up thanks thank

00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,549
you

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,549
