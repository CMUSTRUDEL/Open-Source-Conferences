open collaboration services needs a new

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,480
release of its API and we went through a

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,559
few details on that and other than that

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,430
it ended up being mostly a rundown of

00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:00,180
what people would would like to happen

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,219

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,430
yes and what people would like to be

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,350
able to on the server side as well so we

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:13,549
can selecting service requirements that

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,549
is for that and pull it up in a lot

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,490
speaking of collecting requirements we

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,409
have the city of Munich who is here to

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,869
talk about their requirements for the

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:36,390
desktop yeah we did talk about rebound

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:41,220
back you'll experience enough we did

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:45,290
write a longer and the notes mainly we

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:49,950
did talk about fpdm bishop issues and

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:53,869
network shares we already got on the

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:58,649

00:01:53,869 --> 00:02:01,280
time and again thanks you make a really

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,280
good stuff

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,440
let's making a really good desktop means

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,450
that our applications have show up

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,700
they're new they're shiny they need

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,340
improvements Albert has to ask the next

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,560
question does translate so that's what

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,500
we've got the kdu what application

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,520
lifecycle policy for and there's AB off

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,950
on that and it's got complied so we

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,950
discuss new Kitty patient lifecycle

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:38,340
which I had written a draft off and the

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:40,380
good news is we approved it by gramming

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,300
technologies and workflows we have the

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,010
playground then we have incubator over

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,480
here and we have MIDI review which lasts

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,540
two weeks but no more than two months

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,739
and then we have these applications or

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,140
various other ways you're releasing it

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:56,940
and then things die a slow visible net

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:59,250
and and we looked at how to do some

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,890
automated QA sets and we have those

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,720
notes in terms of improving the ability

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,100
to do that and make sure everybody has

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,560
access to our application creation

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,360
system so that everybody can you see I

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:17,190
even when you're still just starting at

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:19,530
in segment I'm personally very happy

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,900
that everyone will be in CI early in the

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,610
cycle because that I don't have to start

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,610
complaining about Linux isms later

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:35,459
moving on to the other bathrooms they

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,880
started with the user base plan goal

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:42,600
post

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:46,590
it's an ambition yes we are reading

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,750
about user base which is in a solid

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,560
state at the present so we need to step

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:56,090
up the action and we have a plan so

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,090
expect to complete some action

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:08,490
you're interested there's a telegram

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:12,050
group for the user base what and there's

00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:14,610
a link on the notes page contains

00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,790
accomodation goods applications and

00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,230
we've got user base to talk about how to

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,489
use the applications what we're still

00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:22,470
not getting those applications into

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:27,930
people's hands the best way to do that

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:30,180
is enforce you know for somebody he's

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:35,010
