Title: Franklin Weng - Adopting ODF: What We Need in Calligra -  Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	n Taiwan the National Development Council (NDC) launched a three-year project to adopt ODF as national standard file format. Recently we mainly use and promote LibreOffice but it's always better to have more choices. Can Calligra meet our requirement?

Open Document Format (ODF) has been the national standard in Taiwan since 2009, but nobody cared until 2014. The National Development Council (NDC) in Taiwan launched a three-year project to moving from Microsoft Office format (including old doc/ppt/xls to OOXML) to ODF.

For the software we have LibreOffice, OpenOffice, Abiword, Calligra, Google Docs, ... etc to choose. However besides LibreOffice and OpenOffice, Calligra couldn't meet the requirement for now. In this short talk I'll show what's missing in Calligra Words/Sheets/Stage and hope that they can be improved for users in Taiwan.

thank you thank you everyone good

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,880
afternoon

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:19,460
in this talk I will talk about

00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:24,260
recent years in Taiwan we are adopting

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:26,360
open document format in government as

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,470
the central government asks everyone to

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:34,460
use ODF and I will get to a short

00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:37,300
background introduced and then talk

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:42,100
about how do we need in Congo

00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:48,079
so the first let me show some background

00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:51,579
actually in 2009 in 2009 we have already

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:55,940
made it as all national standard that

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:59,600
means census other night our government

00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:05,110
the official documents should use ODF

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,930
but without any surprise nobody cares

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:12,680
okay everyone are still using because of

00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:17,690
all this in what he cares about this but

00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:23,630
then in 2014 an incident change your

00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:27,079
condition don't know what it is no the

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:29,810
UK top government in regard to the layer

00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:34,040
that the whole government uses the open

00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,909
deployment and his suite derived from

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,829
the office

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:43,790
name the govt office and so in a pattern

00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:46,240
half of 2014 our national developer

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:50,539
concealed us in our central government

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,060
when never one organization in or sent

00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:57,430
government they started a series of

00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:01,820
discussion so that is an act on power

00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:04,460
that is an up to Tom power to awaken a

00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,399
currently awakened because we have

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:11,930
already ascended there but we never use

00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:13,840
that so now we have the chance and in

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,750
early 2015

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,750
then one of our country's not here as a

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:24,530
Taiwan and even Khan is here they

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:27,670
started to migrate not they first they

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:32,290
called an office but then I I such as in

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:35,740
nÃºmero fees and no one who migrated the

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:39,420
whole devolve to the whole country kanji

00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:42,790
government including the schools

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:49,390
everyone so I got a chance to help them

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:53,380
and until now 2017 they're still using

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:56,590
the Mafia and ODF they never give up so

00:02:53,380 --> 00:03:00,070
I think that is a very big victory for

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:04,780
us and I presented in the revolves

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:12,060
conference 2015 that's my presentation

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:17,580
of time all of my own my all of Mike's

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:21,430
expectation after my presentation 2015

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:28,030
amazing chain reaction happen some

00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:31,209
brokers they wrote articles to report

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,239
upon my presentation yes

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,060
and I someone someone wrote me a mail

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:42,790
telling me this and I collected all the

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:48,459
articles and then I had needy happily

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:51,700
and for the paternity writer say enough

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:57,850
hey good news sir not the whole world no

00:03:51,700 --> 00:04:01,870
story is migrating to ODF I believe that

00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:05,080
what I believe that the officer must

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:12,010
have cost me a lot that time actually

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:16,239
that but it's been already a fact so he

00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:20,440
X notes of the local government to some

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:25,750
either proposals from a great ODF okay

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:28,630
that's the background and these years

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,510
actually we are not only telling people

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:37,720
to use Libre Office as how do we call

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:38,500
them is the format is very important we

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,400
need

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:46,870
compared for me to permit compare ODF

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,810
and osm which is used by my office if we

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:54,270
compare the four met the advantage of

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:56,980
ODF is very very clear but if we compare

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,920
from The Oval Office or evolve is or

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,170
even colleague wah between metals or

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,580
office then everyone will say oh you

00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:07,950
like this you like that

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:14,290
in another good thing so my focus on

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:18,640
turn it and tell them now we have many

00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:21,880
tools to use with many tools to use and

00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,630
we need the more tools for people to use

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,120
for example of course developes attach

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:33,430
office also Google document can save us

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:36,130
o DF 1 and the office suites are like a

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,070
reward each a numeric and Kanagawa and

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:44,650
sometimes we have web ODF library to

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:48,130
make some web use and I will tell them

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:52,960
not to use Microsoft Office why not

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:55,000
because the audio file is saved in if we

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,410
open it in the Libre Office or other

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:06,970
office suite will be in the whole mess

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:10,390
okay the C GPO in Taiwan Microsoft CEO

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:13,540
in Taiwan and then meet that they be

00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,550
something in the audio file also I tell

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,140
people not to use my authority not

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,440
because we are against the Microsoft

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:25,000
because also they now process the audio

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:30,419
file correctly ok and also we attend the

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:36,250
audio profiles to test more so now we

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:40,470
into the calibre of course Congolese the

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:44,260
mentors we tell people to use in our

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:48,760
training courses is on the levels too

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:51,040
but I would like to tell people that

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,420
it's not you only choice

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:59,830
okay Cara actually I translated the KO

00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:02,530
fees very many years ago and I know I

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:05,230
know that the change is from Kelvin some

00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:11,140
kuriboh and also Prieta became

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:16,150
independent and I know a nautical so in

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:20,110
this time I tried cargo again okay

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:24,340
this design is really simple racing very

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:27,780
different but I will say if it how to

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,880
use no it's actually very simple and

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:36,160
another one is that contrary and as far

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:39,190
as I test I can only save us ODF if we

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,980
will try to save it as DLC X and the PLC

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,930
and it will tell you or explode then

00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,390
here you are we have no attitude to

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,930
solve that so actually there is no way

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:55,540
to save stability of the HDX and I think

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:59,620
actually it is very good would like to

00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:04,380
use policy ax well of course there are

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:08,440
something we need in Kokura that's not

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:11,020
that's not not here yet the most

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,780
important is the CJ support Chinese

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:18,340
Japanese Korean and this circle

00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:21,190
supporters like for example this is the

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,440
prophets and in the felt in the

00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,500
character you can see there are action

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,290
action and the Western takes funds we

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,680
can select but when a character we have

00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:36,220
only one in a category we have only one

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,380
week only choose one from the Western

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,690
Asia but actually Asia in the Western

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:44,229
and are they're very different we need

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:48,490
different ways to process it okay also

00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:51,760
test Direction currently now only parent

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,370
Japan have vertical writing that is

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:59,710
supported by the office but now the

00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:01,839
Karakoram okay frog aqui para fishes

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:07,990
the audience my colleague wah is not

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:10,420
quite horrible for example if I open

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:16,680
this miss froy's generated by the

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:21,700
province and I over it in Cobra ie stage

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:25,709
is okay but I kind of slice in koreguaje

00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:30,490
it with liberal fees become like this

00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:31,930
the font size is different you don't

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:38,380
change something

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:41,050
so first we'll need make it more in the

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,899
Opera book and that can be playing the

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,360
audio profiles and I hope no token can

00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:50,140
join and other furthermore the

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:53,290
coefficients or saturation yes it's been

00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:56,200
a long time and not precedent generation

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:59,529
again so that's our responsibility so

00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,560
finally I know the candy bar is actually

00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:07,420
part of the kV project so it's not about

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,580
encounter I values that my style I would

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:13,540
like to make it another choice for

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:17,020
people to use to create documents and I

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:21,060
hope in KDE community we will have more

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,060
as an F comes on it

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,429
