Title: Paul Brown - Looking for Love - Akademy 2017
Publication date: 2017-11-20
Playlist: Akademy 2017
Description: 
	Learn three things you can do to improve how you present your project to users, collaborators and sponsors.

Good ideas often go unnoticed because they are described in an opaque, convoluted or jargon-heavy way. In this talk we will show that, by shifting focus, it is possible to explain a project in simple terms that can help garner support.

so I'm Paul I'm four

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:19,400
Tomoe team and I'm gonna talk about why

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:25,610
sometimes you don't get all the love you

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:30,260
you deserve for your projects this is

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:34,930
kind of a trailer I will be talking

00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:39,470
about on Monday at quarter past twelve

00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:42,739
well do a workshop explain where we will

00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:51,110
see how to improve the texts on your

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:56,660
website right here's the thing very

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:59,690
often oh so like 90% of the time when I

00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:05,180
go to a website one of of one of your

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:11,229
projects the first thing I see is a text

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:14,899
that tells me what that project is right

00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:17,060
this is a top-down way of looking at

00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:19,340
things this is this is I'll tell you

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,369
what it is and then we'll work we may

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,280
work our way down to how it is useful to

00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:28,520
you right but there is a problem with

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,229
that very often the people who come to

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,050
your websites don't have the knowledge

00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:38,780
to understand what that thing is right

00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:43,360
so I suggest that you do it the other

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,360
way around that we have a bottom-up

00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:51,470
explanation right so you start by saying

00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:53,380
how it is useful to the reader let me

00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,599
give you an example with kirigami

00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:02,030
anybody is the person who wrote that

00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:04,399
here no good for him or her or whatever

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:08,660
I was going to suggest that you know

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,459
that maybe he should leave this is

00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,550
another thing when you come on Monday

00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:15,410
you're going to have to check your egos

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,209
at the door because we're going to

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,470
destroy everything you have written

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:24,470
right and then build it up again okay no

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,550
problem so let's have a look at this one

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,650
right we have here

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,630
well Kinney gummy is a lightweight user

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,770
interface framework for mobile and

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,990
convergent applications okay I think

00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,260
that everybody here probably understands

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:42,890
that right but everybody who is not here

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:46,400
doesn't I can guarantee that you think

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:48,890
it's intelligible but it's not you are

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,370
reading it through the filter of your

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:55,280
knowledge right let me give you an

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,170
example of maybe some of you will get

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,370
what I'm going to say but I'm going to

00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,750
give you example from another website

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:07,010
from another project that there's not a

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:09,200
KD but it's also gobbledygook the X Y Z

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,960
is the first notarized cryptocurrency

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,350
p2p exchanged for server blockchain

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:20,720
entirely owned by its clients okay who

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:24,860
can tell me what is it no it's not

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:30,620
Bitcoin you you're cheating you have

00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:32,270
blockchain and you said Bitcoin no it's

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,370
not even a cryptocurrency it is

00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,489
something else entirely

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,190
right now let's break but let's get back

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:43,420
to this right let's break that down

00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:48,550
let's see how it is really gobbledygook

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:55,610
so let's take that first sentence right

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:59,600
KD is an acronym lightweight is a

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:03,980
buzzword user interface is jargon and

00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:07,130
the buzzword framework is jargon movin

00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:12,890
it's jargon convergent is jargon and a

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:17,570
buzz word application is jargon so you

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:19,400
have 8 words if we take out is 4 and ant

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,970
which I think everybody can understand

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:26,090
we have 8 words

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:31,520
7 are jargon or buzz words and 1 is the

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:34,580
name of the project so you know what can

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,710
we do with this this is this is this is

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,080
something that nobody outside this room

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,319
can understand

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,389
you are writing for your peers you're

00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:49,120
writing for your colleagues you're not

00:04:44,389 --> 00:05:01,550
writing for the world okay then this has

00:04:49,120 --> 00:05:03,919
okay we've we done so there are two

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:09,199
problems with that first sentence what

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:12,080
is that it is full of words that only

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,780
you understand or only you understand in

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,879
that context what I mean is that sure

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,169
application is a word that you can use

00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,690
in everyday in an everyday language but

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:26,120
it doesn't mean outside this room what

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,639
it means inside this room okay that's

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,090
why he's jargon and the rest are just

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:40,310
terrible I look at that and I want to

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:42,139
cry yes and then we get on to the second

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:47,509
sentence which is better much better

00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:50,090
because it explains what it does what it

00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:53,060
does for the user says allows QT

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,069
developers to easily create applications

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,460
that run on most major mobile and

00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,990
desktop platforms without modification

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,050
it is much better that should probably

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:06,110
be the first sentence right because it

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:10,270
stays what it does then we can get to

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:13,849
what it is right the problem with with

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,319
with something like that is that in the

00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:17,659
first sentence you're going to use mode

00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,750
you're going to lose most of the of the

00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:22,580
of the readers now you may think but why

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,240
should I care because this is only

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,659
interesting for developers right true or

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,740
not

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:34,129
that's why why do you care exactly why

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,839
why should you care well it's very

00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:38,389
simple

00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,949
you don't know who is going to be

00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:41,599
interested in caring I mean who for

00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:44,539
example if somebody came along and said

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,550
okay I have money to spend on a free

00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:50,449
software project Carrigan it sounds

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,289
interesting goes here doesn't understand

00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,680
it

00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:57,949
and leaves you about leaving his money

00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:02,479
right that's one the other thing is you

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:05,539
know not either not everybody is an

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,139
already hardened developers developer

00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:12,169
like you lot right some of them and you

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:17,089
and they don't have the vocabulary right

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:20,300
and you want to introduce them to to 2k

00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,279
de-annex technologies so you have to

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,080
write for everybody you have to write

00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:33,099
for the world you don't know who you're

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:33,099
going to need to understand this right I

00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:47,300
suggest for example an alternative to

00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:52,399
say I haven't I haven't written it down

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:56,120
for a slide or anything like this but if

00:07:52,399 --> 00:08:00,050
I were to write that I mean I do this

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,789
all the time I do it for for for KDE and

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,819
I do it for companies and things like

00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,680
that they send me their press releases

00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:08,719
and it's always tech companies I work

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,019
for they send me their press releases

00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:15,289
they send me their white papers etc and

00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:16,939
my job is to convert it into something

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:24,339
that everybody can understand a

00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:30,080
journalist a boss right or any reader

00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:33,919
okay so after after dedicating a long

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,839
five minutes to this I thought that

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:42,260
maybe this would be a good alternative

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:44,510
right if you and I'm trying to conserve

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,209
or I'll try to keep all the meaning here

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,790
right so bear with me if you want to

00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:52,100
create apps that work the same on mobile

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,899
phones and desktop computers and you

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,019
don't want to have to program in

00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:59,060
everything twice or three times till you

00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:02,439
get me gives you all the tools you need

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,439
and that's it

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:10,910
okay what would the problems be with

00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:20,030
that projects to that say who objects to

00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:22,310
that text that that that one yes that's

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:33,830
word how many what buzzwords are they in

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:39,470
here if you want to create apps apps is

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:41,870
a buzz word maybe okay that worked the

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,810
same on mobile phones mobile phones is a

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,570
buzz word not really and they stop

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,070
computers buzz word not really and you

00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,240
don't want to have to program everything

00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:58,400
twice no buzz words there or three times

00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:00,740
pallet one second one second one second

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,020
okay first of all first of all as I said

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,150
written in five minutes it's not

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,280
necessarily the final draft there's like

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,640
a sales pitch but that is exactly what

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,230
your website is it's a sales mechanism

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,880
that is what you want to do you want

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,600
people to be interested in your because

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,600
of always why bother

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:40,680
yes yes this yes I didn't say it was

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,240
awesome

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,520
I think they cam is awesome by the way

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,320
if anybody hears developers of ki I do

00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,610
think it was awesome I didn't say it was

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,610
awesome I just said what it was

00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:38,280
yeah oh sorry sorry sorry man yeah I do

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,800
have it in haiku for more so you wanna

00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,980
hear it

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:54,660
there then up for phones for desktop

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:58,200
computers to kirigami rules I think that

00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,660
summarizes in what Katie gave me is

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,840
quite nicely okay it's a bit of skew but

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,840
I wouldn't probably use it but there are

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:10,740
many ways of saying what you want to say

00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:13,590
okay mine may be sound they salesmanship

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,540
but you know why it sounds like that to

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,960
you because you're you can

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,610
understand it because it's for everybody

00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,190
right it sounds like some guy on

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,080
television selling you detergent right

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:28,770
because he has to go to the lowest

00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:35,450
denominator but you to because that's

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:35,450
why you have a website tell me sorry

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:42,120
yeah but he's public but wait one second

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,790
yeah one second one second but you put

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:57,180
kiddie Gary Kelly KD in Google that's

00:12:44,790 --> 00:13:00,960
the first thing that comes up so that

00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:05,280
the problem is the problem is that it's

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:10,290
the first result on Google so people who

00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:13,050
are interested in this I mean yesterday

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,120
I wrote an article for a general take

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,040
blog so to take blog it's for people

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,350
that like things like iPhones and

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,130
iPhones and PS fries and stuff like that

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,380
but I said okay

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:26,920
I'm gonna I'm gonna stick carry gummy in

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:30,460
there right and I did okay and I

00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:34,060
explained it like like I just said right

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:38,410
this is this thing that computer

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:40,300
programmers can use to program for all

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,710
sorts of platforms right and they don't

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,870
have to write things twice or three

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:46,420
times etc and basically that was it I

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,580
said and with this the Katie community

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,620
is gonna take over the world the mobile

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,700
phone world okay because you know you

00:13:50,620 --> 00:14:01,930
have to finish with something like that

00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:04,210
the thing is things that people would

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:08,860
read that and go click on Kerry gummy

00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:11,980
and then B's and then B I mean don't you

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,990
guys want people to like your do you

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:19,680
want to put them off really is that the

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:19,680
endgame say I don't know this no but

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:32,920
absolutely yes yes look absolutely okay

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:39,070
but okay I yes but yes and no yes or no

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:41,590
I okay I cheated a bit I cheat I cheated

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,620
a bit I cheated a bit by picking Kerry

00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:47,560
egami I cheated obviously yes but that

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,110
said okay that's it there's nothing

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,180
wrong in this web bridge and this even

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,130
in the top it says tech base what is

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,260
wrong is the fact that we don't have the

00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,600
counterpart the commercial counterpart

00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,040
that you want so this actually the fault

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,260
is that you don't have the other part

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,600
but this is not wrong this is for

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,020
developers yeah that's the problem the

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:11,200
problem is that this is the only thing

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:15,010
this is the only thing right this is so

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,620
as I say if we if if there was an

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,930
alternative to this if there was another

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,140
first result in Google and this was the

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:26,410
second result okay no problem but this

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,760
is the first result and below that there

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,940
is nothing else okay

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,780
yes

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,780
I'll tell you

00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,310
yes

00:15:50,090 --> 00:16:04,130
okay fine I but so the state of the

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,530
discussion in the room right now is that

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:09,230
his version is less well targeted as

00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,730
developers and that's been accepted as a

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,640
fact that I totally disagree with that

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:17,510
because this text that's on the wiki

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,820
right now doesn't speak to anything that

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,890
I would actually do as a developer like

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,870
his version says you write it once and

00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,510
it runs across devices right which is

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:29,150
how I would actually make an application

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:32,030
using kirigami so his version tells me

00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,790
what my process of using kirigami as a

00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:37,460
developer would be where it was the

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,560
version on the wiki page the only word

00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,860
that hints at this right it runs and it

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,500
runs across devices is convergent and

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:49,190
convergent it's not how I developed like

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:52,580
I I'm not a convergent the work right

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,830
yes sorry sorry I'm sorry but the

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:58,880
programs that convergence user is a word

00:16:54,830 --> 00:17:02,840
that became so like popular two three

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:05,540
years ago tops right convergence outside

00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:09,500
this room also doesn't mean what it

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:12,830
means in this room okay it doesn't even

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,300
mean the same in develop in communities

00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:21,050
that develop for things that are not

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:25,760
mobile okay so you know I tell you what

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:31,490
what what is happening here my job here

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:35,260
is to get the most the biggest number of

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:42,410
quality members into your community as

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:49,160
possible right and one way that I want

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:51,560
to achieve this is like having you make

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,810
your message more accessible to a larger

00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:57,710
audience is that does that make sense

00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:01,790
does that make sense to you

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:05,630
so yes right

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:09,380
the problem I have with these things is

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:15,710
that and sorry I don't know your name

00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:19,310
but Danny's Danny said I cheated because

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:22,070
I picked carry gommi but that doesn't

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,660
really happen in carry gommi I have tons

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,030
of examples that we will see on Monday

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:30,400
if you don't bring your own where you

00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:33,020
will see that end user applications are

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,690
the explanation on their website their

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:38,380
first paragraph is chock-a-block with

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:44,690
jargon and he doesn't say what it does

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:48,170
this thing yeah I mean if now most of

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:52,030
you go home and look at your your

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,030
websites and start thinking of Oh

00:18:52,450 --> 00:19:12,200
mission accomplished for me I can't hear

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:17,390
you very well so sorry this is it what

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:19,850
you get yeah there are tricks sorry

00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,940
developers writing documentation writing

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:26,480
thing yeah okay I agreed that the the

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:30,860
wording is very boring basically so it

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,780
could be a bit lighter lighter style on

00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:37,430
the other hand it's probably due to the

00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:42,200
fact that whoever wrote this was trying

00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:44,330
to start a page for developers and so on

00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,030
so yeah I see the problem

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,280
the problem is that it's not even it's

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:53,770
not even more precise than what I said

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:57,890
yeah okay now your part your your first

00:19:53,770 --> 00:20:01,790
expression all those first is it was

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:05,420
actually better than then there whether

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:09,650
on this this one is a wiki so yeah the

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:11,420
thing is the thing is that that you say

00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,950
developers writing documentation where

00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,940
I'm going to tell you something you are

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,259
not bored

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:21,169
this way okay you learnt this right

00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:23,090
and you learnt this by reading too

00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:25,309
much documentation you like you're like

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:28,250
donkey xote right

00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:31,370
who went mad because he read too many

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,970
books about Knights and Calgarians

00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:37,070
like that

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:38,750
you guys have been contaminated the

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:42,139
thing is also that the version on the

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:44,950
wiki page whoever wrote the text didn't

00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:47,600
do it with the mission on mind of

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,720
respecting developers they tried to

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,940
pretend to be PR people and picked words

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,470
that they saw it said a lot and said

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,470
very little like lightweight and

00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,840
converging like it's trying to emulate

00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,820
something without really knowing what

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,549
you're doing yeah that usually doesn't

00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:06,620
work so the point that this version is

00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:14,620
somehow more respectful of the developer

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:17,090
audience is not true at all oh yeah then

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,909
there is interest there's an interesting

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:22,850
point when I write press releases for

00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:24,710
for for companies you know there is

00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,179
nothing that annoys me more I mean I get

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,460
my red patent out and there's nothing

00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:32,570
that annoys me more than when they start

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:35,539
with we are excited to announce we are

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:38,990
market leaders and bla bla bla bla bla

00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:41,179
oh that goes out then I send my version

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,519
back and they say oh but this is not

00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:46,309
like a press release at all I mean we go

00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:49,460
to I you go to press release sent out by

00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:52,960
IBM and by one second we're having an

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:58,419
interesting conversation here like

00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:03,740
alright we're getting kicked out sure

00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:05,389
just so yeah I see y'all are having a

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,919
lot of fun with this but the bus leaves

00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:10,399
in exactly 15 minutes so we should

00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:13,970
probably try to rap so you can attack me

00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:16,990
in in the passage or whatever

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,990
