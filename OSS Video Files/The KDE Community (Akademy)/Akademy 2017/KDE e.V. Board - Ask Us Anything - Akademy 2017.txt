00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:41,719
so you can ask them about the flight

00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:44,120

spent all of our money on so i canna has

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,899

account anyway so they're ready for your

00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:56,199
questions and okay this stage is all

00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,199
yours

00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,220
Adrianna

00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:06,440
maybe before we start with questions we

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:14,000
start with a short introduction or does

00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:15,230
everyone know us no okay all right so hi

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,590
I'm Lydia

00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:21,680
I'm with kitty for i think 11 or 12

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:27,560
years now and on the board since six of

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:29,780
those hi I'm Thomas I've been in Kitty

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,310
since 2008 enough been elected to the

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:38,420
board last year my name is Micah I got

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:41,420
elected yesterday I've been using

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,810
Kitty's since about 99 and hacking on it

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,290
since 2005 and became an IV member about

00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:54,800
two years later and I hack on plasma and

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:57,380
some app I managed Paul I've been also

00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,260
developing KD for a long time over ten

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:04,240
years this year and I've been in part of

00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:08,239
the kiddie AV board for three years now

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,629
hi my name is Sandra and Raji I'm coach

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:15,110
we didn't show H you KDE and for almost

00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:19,190
ten eight years already and I'm in the

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,480
board of directors since 2015 for two

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:26,740
years

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,930
so the question I have two questions I'm

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,880
gonna state them both and then the

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,580
people I'm asking them of are going to

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,450
answer them so I'm gonna ask I K

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:43,900
what does Katie ee-vie do and then I'm

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:47,830
gonna ask Lydia is Ike a'right well I

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,840
think the Eevee's mission is to first of

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,000
support the KD community and its various

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,660
activities so it needs to have its ear

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,490
on the ground

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,810
and there's always been there's been

00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,340
sort of an awkward relationship between

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,890
the community and the Evy at times

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,960
because the V is supposed to stay out of

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,060
steering decisions that the community

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,670
makes but at the same time it's sort of

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,670
the only organ we have to make sort of a

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:17,470
voting decision so that doesn't always

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,850
work but I think it's about so if we've

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,890
built up a lot of institutional

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:25,890
knowledge in the EB over the last 20

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,890
years and it's about continuing that

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,750
you've learned well for your first day

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:43,450
yes it would maybe add to that that in

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:45,940
general we see T V as the organization

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:49,350
that supports what the KT community is

00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,930
doing in organizational matters like

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,670
this Academy financial matters getting

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,490
some of you here by paying for your

00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,160
plane tickets and so on and legal

00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:02,350
matters by for example working with a KD

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:11,190
free cute foundation in order to keep

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:11,190
cute free next question here

00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:35,270
so follow in the question and also the

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:38,780
question I asked yesterday the mention

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:42,440
of the KETV is to support the whole KD

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:49,730
community and do you think it's

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:54,490
reasonable to elect to that all the

00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:58,160
members vote if one can join Eevee

00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:01,520
do you understand now right now we will

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:07,130
have a proposal for someone if he wants

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:09,770
to join the KETV and and after the war

00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,430
systems we will say okay how many

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:17,060
Walters and how many agrees who may

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:20,540
disagree how many options but to loosing

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:23,900
it reasonable for people to join in the

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:28,100
Eevee if I want to support Eevee you are

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:31,880
on to support Katie why do I need to let

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:35,650
other members agree and the other

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:41,720
question is the same we have twice the

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:44,660
valley vote number is not enough but we

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,680
still have no conclusion that if it is

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,930
the world avoided or disagree these

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,950
people join you

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:57,080
so what do you think about this okay so

00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:00,290
for a little bit of context for people

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:06,140
who are not part of the Eevee or don't

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:09,260
really follow the email last a shirt to

00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,700
Jenny cadine membership one of the one

00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,180
part of the process is that you will

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,980
answer a questionnaire and this will be

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,620
sent to the membership and then there is

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,550
a vote to decide if this person should

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:25,280
be part of the KDP membership or not

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:28,060
part of the issue that Franklin is

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,700
pointing out is that

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,889
of the rules we have is that there is a

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,790
quorum that needs to be matched and at

00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:41,460
some point there was a vote that didn't

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:44,350
have enough votes for it to be valid and

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,900
so the vote was invalid which is

00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:50,070
actually what happened right what is

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,570
left to be discussed is whether that's

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,580
philosophically what we want to happen

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,889
in the organization we are creating

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,389
which is actually a very good debate to

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,960
have and actually it's something we

00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:03,790
should be having I myself I feel I'm in

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,580
a position where I'm not an expert in

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,729
votes or democracy I mean I have a

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,290
notion like most of us have but I don't

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,270
really know what would be the best

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,990
solution I can see how it's it's a

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,550
problem but we need to have someone who

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,280
is interested in this subject and wants

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,320
to fix it regarding whether we should

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,450
have a vote or not which you also

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,760
pointed out if I understood you

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,760
correctly I think that it kind of makes

00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,930
sense that if you have to work on

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,770
something that you believe that it's

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:37,840
truly important you get to at least

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,460
choose who you're working with in the KT

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,710
community actually there is no kind of

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,750
vote everybody one can can can

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,340
collaborate and actually in the KT

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,900
community is where we're actually

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,729
creating our products where we're

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,190
actually creating the value that we add

00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:53,080
the kdv on the other hand is an

00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,750
organization to support that and it's an

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,270
organization where we have to trust each

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,310
other much more and we have to discuss

00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:02,650
subjects that are not strictly related

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:07,180
with the product in itself and I can see

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:09,639
how these was at least I can see how

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,639
this was initially the idea whether it

00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,590
could be changed or obviously up for

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,630
discussion as everything I actually

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:21,039
always believed that if something is

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,389
considered to be a problem always should

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,880
be discussed but on the other hand I

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,979
don't really have the impression that it

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,930
has been a problem in the past if

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:32,479
anybody wants to collaborate with Katie

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:38,029
they have I have not seen

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:40,760
a case where the member has been not

00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,620
accepted in the organization there have

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,130
been some problems in the past that's

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,800
for sure but it's always cases that are

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:52,339
not conclusive as in we can look into it

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,740
into the program again and see what what

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:57,440
what we can do so that this person who

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,570
is is trying to join can actually bring

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,160
the value to the organization that he

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,260
wants to bring which is actually what we

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,680
are after right and if there are

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,690
doubtful cases we should also actually

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,139
discuss that right we don't have to let

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,630
ourselves be blind by some numbers that

00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,639
haven't gone the way we liked if there

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,620
are some formula that we don't like we

00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,720
change it we are software developers we

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:27,970
do that every day we need to do it with

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:31,220
our codes and so adding adding to that

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,959
for me the problem is not that there is

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,510
a vote about whether people can come

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,060
into the IV or not to me that still

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,819
makes sense the the big problem that we

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,440
have right now is the large number of

00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:44,000
people who still have active voting

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,470
rights but are not exercising them

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,240
because they don't really care about

00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,649
Katie anymore

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,120
this has been discussed at the AGM and

00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:55,100
yeah people have have brought up that we

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,459
should make it maybe easier to set

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,610
yourself to active or passive and maybe

00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:04,250
we should have another push in in the

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,170
mailing list to ask people to ask

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,540
themselves okay do it really wants to

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,790
have to keep my boat and do I want to

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,550
either have my vote and also use it

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:16,130
actively or maybe just not keep my vote

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,949
still keep staying in the Eevee because

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:21,410
it's a bunch of my friends and I want to

00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:24,350
keep connected with them but not have a

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,199
right to vote because I won't actually

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,069
use it and yeah this is something that I

00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:32,569
will definitely want to follow up I

00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:34,970
during the a DMA I said that I had

00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:36,829
written an email to the mailing list

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,110
asking people to think about that and I

00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:42,170
had but it was in a thread which many

00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,760
people probably didn't even read so that

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,170
was not really good placement of that

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,360
but this is something we can change of

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,940
course and so just really and this could

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,520
already be a lot of help to have only

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,500
those with active voting rights who

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,270
actually are likely to use them and then

00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,750
we won't have such a situation with the

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:03,120
too low

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:05,220
quorum so in terms of voting on new

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,040
Eevee members that's that's a

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:11,460
peer-review system the kind of which we

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,230
kind of use all over KDE and you

00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,060
actually get a lot out of that for

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,190
example if you look at how we do

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,230
developer accounts right we have very

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,820
flat hierarchies within the community if

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,550
you have a developer account you can

00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,550
commit to anything and that only really

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:30,270
works if the stranger committing to your

00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,980
codebase if you believe a that they are

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,760
supposed to do that that they have the

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,070
right to do that

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,770
you trust there was some process that

00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:41,280
gave them those access privileges and

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:43,230
that process check them surly and and

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,760
you trust that person right they they

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,460
have commit access and they should have

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,460
commit access and also it's very

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,650
important for them to feel that they are

00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,990
within their right to commit to your

00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:57,960
codebase like it's about emancipating

00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,670
those people and for developer accounts

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,740
we use the same sort of peer review

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,080
system when you apply for a developer

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,390
account you have to name a supporter

00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,610
this admin will ask that supporter for

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,470
input on whether you should really get

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,690
your developer account and if you

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,920
support your case that then you're in

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,090
and what that process ensures is that

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,830
somebody thinks you understand the

00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:23,340
etiquette of how the community works

00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:26,130
together and you are now fit to to have

00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,230
a developer account and you can share

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,170
those responsibilities and those rights

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:34,350
and that's kind of how it works in the

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,960
AV as well if you need supporters to

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:40,350
join DV and if a vote confirms that you

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,600
should be in the AV then that

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,160
immediately equips you with with the

00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,130
feeling that you are accepted that you

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,130
can step up to do things and at the same

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,260
time everybody in the membership already

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:55,260
will now know that you're supposed to be

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:58,530
there so I think you get a lot out of a

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,180
peer-review system like that I know I

00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,280
used to sing as well that is kind of

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,800
awkward that the Eevee self selects its

00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,900
own members and that could lead by

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,340
corruption and whatever but I think you

00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,040
also have to look at the real track

00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,590
record so I've been in the EVs since ten

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,930
years and I think there have been two

00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,850
applications that have been rejected in

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:23,190
that time and there were kind of obvious

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,930
cases so I don't think there's any

00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,570
indication that there really has been a

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,160
problem with it and if you think it

00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,870
really has been a problem then you

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,490
should definitely point that out and

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:40,110
raise it and then we need to deal with

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:43,290
that one thing that happened in Cadiz

00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,240
Spain view one year ago is that we

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,530
actually realized that it was kind of a

00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,930
problem we were following exactly the

00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:51,720
same model we did in the TV membership

00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:55,140
and actually the concern there wasn't

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,880
that you would be having like some

00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,360
people deciding who gets in but it was

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,490
more of a it's a bit of a overly too

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,350
complex process right so what we did

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:08,700
there and maybe it's something we could

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:12,020
export to the membership is that the

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,580
applicant also sends a message with some

00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,220
questions answered and basically the

00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,230
membership can move that the person to

00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,300
enter if they know that they're a bad

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,600
person or something or a crazy person

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,250
but in general like there's no voting in

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,230
itself this could be done but then it's

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,540
something that doesn't need to happen by

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,310
us like we're not your parents if you

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:37,410
guys think that something is important

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:39,030
you can propose it um one thing in

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,220
addition of course if you've been

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,400
contributing to Kelly for for a while

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,200
and you're not a member but you feel

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,320
like you would like to contribute to

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:52,320
furthering the organization that

00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,330
supports KDE then talk to an existing

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,010
you remember and for example all of us

00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:02,060
so that we can help you write your

00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,060
application and so on

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,269
and also in addition to show that in the

00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,399
case where you become acadia if you

00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:13,529
remember of if you are already actually

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,170
if you remember there are a number of

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:20,880
the tasks that you can help the world to

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:24,720
do so so we have a fabricator work book

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,910
where there are a lot of the tasks that

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,029
shouldn't be done by the board and so

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:34,740
you are all invited to pick up one of

00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:48,540
you in have they made right any other

00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:50,959
questions hello

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,699
considering the entry barriers for new

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:57,149
persons or new victims on Katie

00:15:53,699 --> 00:16:00,269
I've seen a lot of frustration because

00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:04,410
we are on github but we don't accept all

00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:13,350
requests on github are we going to try

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:16,500
to loosen the tights there well this

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:18,899
this topic whether we should accept poor

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,740
requests on github that was discussed

00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:25,050
very extensively by the community and in

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,399
the end it was the community who decided

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,930
not to do it and this was I mean not

00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,410
everybody agreed with that but there was

00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:35,880
pretty broad consensus so that is

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,430
definitely not something that we would

00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,470
ever interfere with so as long as the

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,149
community the majority of the community

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,459
seems to think that this is not

00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:47,399
something we should do and this is how

00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:49,680
it is again if you think this should

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,990
change then what you'd have to do is

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,509
convince fellow Katie contributors that

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,100
this is a good idea and then it would

00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:58,199
certainly be changed so it's not

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:06,150
something that is decided top-down in

00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:08,159
any way so I'd like to ask a question in

00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:13,890
relation to the previous question that

00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:18,360
was asked do you think that people

00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:20,459
the community think that gaining big

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,530
becoming a member there becoming a

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,360
member of the KETV because it gives them

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:28,079
some form of status within the community

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,140
or could it be perceived or do you think

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,600
that that's why some of the problems

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,400
that we have actually happen or and in

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,130
continued in continuation to that do you

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,440
think like you could better define and

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,690
better communicate what sort of people

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,580
with what sort of goals should be in the

00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:48,419
Evie and people with what sort of goals

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:56,400
should not be a part of the that's not

00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:58,590
what the Evie is far yeah I haven't

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,840
really encountered that do you feel

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,429
there's a perception in the community

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,450
that there's sort of a class difference

00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:08,700
between you know because I haven't met

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,100
anybody who is not on the Evie and

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,950
doesn't feel like the part of the KDE

00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,950
community if just because they're not in

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:21,110
the Evie so like have you actually

00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:26,309
encountered that in the wild yes I

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:28,730
wouldn't know I I did get the distinct

00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:31,200
feeling a couple of times then yes so

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:33,270
well if that's the case then I do think

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,130
we should fix that I think it should be

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,890
clearly communicated at the Evie is the

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,620
support organization and the reason to

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:43,080
be and Evie is to get worked on

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,179
supporting the community and or make

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,429
sure there's a representative sampling

00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,440
of the community in the Evie so it can

00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:53,490
make credible and legitimate decisions

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,200
and that's about it it just the best

00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,110
case scenarios that it creates extra

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,880
work for you right so I think that we

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:03,120
should have more communication in in the

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,500
sense that what sort of who if you were

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,690
this this this then you should apply to

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,049
the Evie this communication along those

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,660
lines

00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:12,540
well one thing nothing I think that it's

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,830
worth understanding that if somebody has

00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,360
been a long-term contributor to KD it's

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:21,200
logical that there are interested in

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,360
being part of the KTV membership it's

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,550
because if you're committed lots of

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,160
lines of code for example of or you

00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,450
lots of articles on the on the promo it

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,280
means that you're involved in the

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,350
project in in different levels and you

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,300
will be interested in collaborating at

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,800
an organizational level so it's

00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,720
definitely something that should follow

00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,100
and I know people who have been

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,090
contributing that they have told me no

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,040
no I'm not interested in the

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,540
organizational part and that's perfectly

00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,920
fine and I don't consider them like

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:56,520
lesser contributors or human beings but

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:59,580
that okay so I'm going to ask the

00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:03,920
question nobody wants to answer is kV a

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,920
supportive body or a governance body

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:22,020
thank you at the end of the day I think

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,210
it has to be both we have to have the

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:30,270
organization that supports the KDE

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:33,300
community to make Academy run to have

00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:36,720
our office where people can send mail

00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:42,330
invoices and so on that that all needs

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:45,920
an organizational support framework but

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:52,950
at the same time Katie he doesn't have

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:56,730
any other thing that could could do that

00:20:52,950 --> 00:21:00,870
kind of governance at the same time for

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:06,020
a large part of KDE that is a touchy

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:06,020
subject because governance is a bad word

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:14,850
but at the end of the day some decisions

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:17,250
need to be made and for example a long

00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:20,580
time ago the creation of a community

00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,470
working group and someone had to make a

00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:27,630
decision that that we want to have that

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:30,560
and we don't have any other other body

00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,560
that that could do that

00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:40,169
yeah so I think the way I think about it

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:42,450
it's not a governance body but it's a

00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:46,320
tool that the wider communities

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,909
sometimes chooses to employ because TV

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,250
has a decision-making system and a

00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:53,840
voting system and it's the only one the

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:56,760
community has so sometimes the community

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,740
appears to decide that somebody has to

00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,289
vote and then looks to the EEV to do

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:05,159
that and the cases where that crops up

00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:07,950
tend to be unfortunate of ugly

00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:11,549
enforcement issues like the one of the

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,320
problems is what if somebody misbehaves

00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:15,690
really badly and at what point do you

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:19,260
kick him out of a mailing list and who

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:22,049
makes that call so when I was on the

00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,960
sysadmin team that was always the

00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:26,669
question is the sysadmin team the body

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,830
that decides to to kick out of the

00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:32,730
mailing list or is that the list

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:34,769
moderator or the Stevie do that and I

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,130
can think of one case where essentially

00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:40,019
it ended up being escalated to the ovide

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,269
membership and something was decided at

00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:43,919
the General Assembly and that set sort

00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:47,850
of an interesting precedent I suppose

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,590
and that's where we are now so you can

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,419
say that there is a track record of

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:56,639
governance decision decisions having

00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:59,250
been made and we should probably look

00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:02,880
into codifying that better at some point

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:04,860
or establishing it better and and then

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,990
having a discussion about whether it's a

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,100
good thing or not but it's what we've

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,100
been doing so far

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:27,420
me okay me I'm gonna ask about money

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:32,220
well you asked us money we've always had

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:36,000
the notion of the nation's and money

00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,490
going to a common pot that made some

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,140
people create their own organizations

00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,970
because they wanted to have their own

00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:48,420
money how do you feel about us having

00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,940
some yeah I know I left the board so I

00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:56,190
can ask the question how do you feel

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:57,630
about us being able to help those people

00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,780
without them having to create an

00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:03,300
organization that we all know sucks and

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:08,150
makes you feel bad and you get fines

00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,150
because you do things bad taxes are evil

00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:15,150
okay so maybe I can I can start

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:19,980
answering that interestingly enough the

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:22,950
times when groups want to move away it's

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,710
when things are great the times when

00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:30,930
they come back to the mothership is when

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:34,950
things suck in whatever shape or form so

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:37,110
as far as I know all the organizations

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:41,100
or groups or whatever that have done

00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:45,720
that in KDE have come back because it

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:52,080
didn't work out so I don't believe that

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:54,930
is a viable way forward yeah

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,960
and I also think that we do need a

00:24:54,930 --> 00:25:01,980
common pot of resources big money or

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:07,290
whatever else that goes into the pieces

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:10,490
of KDE that are not as sexy and that

00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:14,430
wouldn't necessarily be able to attract

00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:17,970
enough resources through shiny

00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:20,580
fundraising and so on but at the same

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,160
time maybe we should need to think about

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:26,610
giving the projects that do really cool

00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,000
stuff and that should get exposure and

00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:31,620
that

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,070
and can can get people excited

00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,169
give them some way to to get a bigger

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:39,570
share of that

00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:44,340
how did looks like I I don't know but

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:45,860
that's something we can discuss yes I

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,059
understand

00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,799
actually it's not true that all of them

00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,570
left and then they're all coming back

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,760
for example Albert and I we started KC

00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:57,570
Spain long time ago we haven't come back

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,909
yet but on the other hand

00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,320
it sucks to create your own organization

00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:03,539
and we want people interested in

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,190
creating free software to actually be

00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:08,130
creating free software and not bothering

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,780
with the bureaucracy which like you can

00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,090
say yeah it's not a big deal it's a

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,700
 big deal it's not fun and

00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:18,059
actually like it's it's a problem and

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,340
while probably not they all have come

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:23,429
back they have all definitely had

00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:25,919
problems with bureaucracy and and that's

00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:29,429
that's a big deal also second thing the

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:33,150
reason why most of them have created an

00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:34,710
organization is because unlike Katy

00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:38,760
Spain which is a different thing is

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:41,720
because they wanted to hire people so

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,880
the question is do we want to allow

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,289
projects to do fundraising and then hire

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,390
people which is a very interesting

00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:50,370
project to have it's something

00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,409
definitely to fix but I think that we

00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,030
need to point out what the actual

00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,919
problem is that people want to actually

00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:58,710
have organisations because it's fun and

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,659
they're successful but it's because when

00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:02,789
you're successful you end when you can

00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:04,559
grow you want to grow so you hire people

00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:06,929
and at the moment we don't allow for

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,940
that hiring people could be interesting

00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:11,159
but how it would work it's not trivial

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,140
and actually we've started to look into

00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:17,659
it but we don't have a good answer to

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,659
give yet so we haven't given any answer

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,990
and I think that apart from the from the

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:28,130
whole hiring situation at all it also

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:30,270
regulates itself somehow because the

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:33,230
there projects that are more successful

00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:35,910
and that might actually get more

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:38,250
donations in are usually also those who

00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,890
are more active who have more people who

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:43,230
are have more people coming to academy

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:46,260
who have more likely to have Sprint's so

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:49,890
they already also get more money out of

00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,750
the common pots so it's it's really yeah

00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,490
it always comes down to people wanting

00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,760
to hire people that's when it becomes

00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,440
difficult and yeah we have to find a

00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,730
solution for that but in general I think

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,140
it's not like there's some project which

00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:07,470
generates all the donations that doesn't

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,880
get much out of it unless they generate

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:15,750
donations without being active which

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:18,000
would be weird I think one sort of

00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,040
benefit to having having some

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,440
organizations that hire peoples of

00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,590
course distributing liability and that

00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,910
kind of thing so you also get some

00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:30,500
things out of it and from the

00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,500
perspective of the mothership I suppose

00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:41,570
disclaimer if worked on one of the

00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:44,809
proposals for next year's Academy and

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:48,080
they wanted to ask if just anything that

00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:50,480
you can tell us yet of what competiting

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:56,419
cities are if there has been anything

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:58,520
that's been decided yet so we have

00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:04,090
received three proposals for hosting

00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:09,919
Academy 2018 from Vienna Belgrade and

00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:12,049
Munich they all were great we discussed

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,570
them in the evie membership and got

00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:23,720
feedback and I think we can announce a

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:26,809
decision tomorrow I'm actually sitting

00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,640
right here I'm I am wondering whether I

00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:34,370
should join or not

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:38,120
DV III I drank Cadiz Spain because I

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:44,030
knew they they could use the help with

00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:46,010
organization search and there's the

00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:49,250
payer a bit of money each year which

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:53,539
helps support Anka days pain thank you

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:56,780
but I don't really I don't really see

00:29:53,539 --> 00:30:00,710
how I could be of help join in the Evy I

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:04,820
mean I really don't see why I would join

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:06,590
I don't see why I would join I actually

00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,280
don't see why I would I'm not really

00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:15,110
sure what I should do so one reason by

00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:18,320
proxy is that kdv gives the power to

00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:21,530
Cadiz Spain regarding the use of

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:25,070
trademark in Spain right if you are

00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:27,679
being even right you want to probably

00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,750
have some kind of control over that

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,470
right there's a lot of reasons why you

00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,970
might want to be part of the kdv and you

00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,929
should look at the tasks we're doing

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:41,419
like holding the trademark of of Kady is

00:30:38,929 --> 00:30:43,580
one of them other could be I don't know

00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:47,450
Fla you can be interested in the licence

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:50,240
of your software the kdv has been

00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:53,420
working on ways to make sure that

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,690
the software stays free forever right or

00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:59,510
the kiddie Free Kids Foundation so these

00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:01,190
are also there these are all subjects

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,590
that are very related to Kaylie much

00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:06,410
like work you've very well being doing

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:09,679
in in Cadiz Spain and I don't really see

00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:12,050
a reason why the reasons why you join

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,530
wouldn't translate in the end is about

00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:17,480
having and organizations that back up

00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:22,070
the the support that you can give in

00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:24,220
into into the project right does that

00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,220
make sense

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,950
I mean at the point where you ask

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,470
yourself should I join then most likely

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,330
the answer is yes because that if you

00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:39,140
ask us of the questions it means that

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:41,929
you care a lot about Katy evey and that

00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:46,360
is already going to likely make you a

00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:49,670
good contributor to the organization

00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,290
unless like many people you don't take

00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:55,840
the tasks that we're putting on the

00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:55,840
fabricator because then it's like okay

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:07,580
yeah I'd brought this up last year and

00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:11,210
I'm bringing it up again this year

00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,970
because of yesterday's because of the

00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:16,010
yesterday's report the KDE League we are

00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,960
leaving money on the table in the US

00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:22,270
because we don't have a 501 C 3

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:25,100
nonprofit organization there there are

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:27,950
people who are willing to donate to KDE

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:30,650
but would like to have those donations

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:35,990
be tax exempt so the donations have to

00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:38,390
be through into an u.s. nonprofit do we

00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:40,640
do we want to do this do we have do we

00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,780
have any preliminary ideas of whether we

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,020
want to do something like this whether

00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,970
we don't want to do this at all or if we

00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:51,200
do want to do something like this should

00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:53,179
we form a task force or should we do

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,980
something about it we already have a

00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:57,290
task force for doing something like that

00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:00,590
but it's not really going in the way you

00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:02,570
like we definitely want to have better

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,680
presence on United States

00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,300
we definitely need

00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,860
we need to have a proper stablished

00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,930
community there which isn't there and

00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,000
that's the reason why we aren't holding

00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,190
the organizational bodies that we are

00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,200
like we're not confident in it as soon

00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,150
as we started to have many thousands of

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,320
people doing organizational stuff which

00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:21,770
is a lot of work like we said before

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,590
having an organization is a lot of work

00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:26,120
and unpleasant work if we had these kind

00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:30,140
of people in United States with the I

00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:33,410
guess all super happy to support and

00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:35,990
gets money from all of these Americans

00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:38,630
who want to donate to as well we need

00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,730
the people first so yeah if you want to

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:43,760
make that happen I think the next steps

00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:45,890
are first of all building up more

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,810
community there with the help of the

00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:52,480
people who are there like Valerie for

00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:54,950
example and and the other thing is help

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,490
disassemble the existing organization

00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:04,000
that we already have that is ongoing but

00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:08,419
has stalled now KDE leak it's called

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,570
once we have that disassembled and at

00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:13,100
least more community in the u.s. that we

00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:20,570
have now then I think we should

00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:22,850
definitely talk about that I believe you

00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,860
were talking about the basically the

00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:34,490
Illuminations part of being able to

00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:37,040
donate we from the USA with okay hearing

00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:41,179
that I'm thinking of chakra the Linux

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:43,850
distribution we we have some kind of

00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:48,080
agreement with I believe it's called the

00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,830
the the it's sspi I think a sobering the

00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,470
Public Interest

00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:53,780
I wonder if that's something that could

00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:58,670
work for having the donations from the

00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:01,520
US are having them tax absent we have

00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,940
done something similar for one

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:10,300
sub-project emerald in the past

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,300
not with SPI but with

00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:26,970
yes that was a lot of overhead so SPI

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:35,310
might be something to look into him um

00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:37,410
if if that is less overhead yeah and

00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:39,450
while he gets the microphone it's part

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,580
of the part of the reason why we created

00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,250
Cadiz Spain at some point is because

00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,160
having a nonprofit organization in a

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,950
country is useful to get the connections

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,080
in that country it makes sense for that

00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,210
but you need to have people like the

00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,560
amount of hours Albert and I have put

00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,390
into doing it for Spain

00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,010
you cannot imagine and it was Spain

00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,960
which I guess that being a smaller

00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:06,620
country makes a smaller amount of work I

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:17,000
guess we have time for another question

00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:17,000
so one more question sorry

00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:24,660
and it's not passive-aggressive cake

00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,660
[Laughter]

00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:39,349
okay if there are no questions further

00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:42,999
questions we can call this a wrap so I

00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:42,999
thank you board thank you mothership

00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:46,960
