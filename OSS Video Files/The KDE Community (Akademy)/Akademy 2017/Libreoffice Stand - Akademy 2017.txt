JONATHAN: So now we're on the LibreOffice stall, and who are you?

00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:15,120
GABRIELE: I am Gabriele Ponzo, and I'm in the membership of the Document Foundation; the foundation who cares about the development and

00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,369
coordinating the development of LibreOffice. JONATHAN: What are the...what do you have on your stall, what are these leaflets?

00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,029
GABRIELE: Well, these materials are for marketing.

00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:26,939
We have English ones, Chinese...

00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:34,780
...and those are intended to present what is LibreOffice, and also how to migrate from

00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,540
common commercial suites, offices, to LibreOffice.

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,240
JONATHAN: And, so you're promoting ODF as the lovely standardized format for office suites?

00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,909
How is that going, has it been adopted in many countries and companies?

00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,330
GABRIELE: Yes, especially in 2014.

00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,609
The UK government, they have chosen ODF as the official

00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,140
standard

00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,519
as a format, and that means a lot because it opens a lot of doors. That's...it's great.

00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:11,218
Because many other governments are following them with such a decision,

00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,718
and so they are moving to ODF as well. Obviously, they couldn't say, we...

00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:23,219
...let's say, "LibreOffice is our official suite" because this is not politically correct, but they can obviously

00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,759
decide on the format in the [?], you know.

00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:29,789
Something that will come.

00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,389
JONATHAN: And...

00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:32,909
 

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,868
...where can we find out more information to take part in using or converting to Open Document?

00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:44,039
GABRIELE:Oh, well, it's a good question. I mean,

00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,179
the first thing is to understand the importance of the freedom and the

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,149
independency, independence, sorry, of the format. And knowing that there is the

00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:04,829
OASIS, which is who cares about the ODF standard, and that means that this is not

00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,169
the LibreOffice format as well as Open Office, or whatever. It's a...

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,869
really an open format and

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,970
it is really something that

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,940
is not owned by anyone.

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,579
This is the opposite of, for example, Microsoft Office, who...

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,479
They do the software and also the format, so this is the first important thing to be understood.

00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,419
Starting from that point, you can say

00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:41,639
You can say...you can show, for example, the real openness of the format, meaning that you can just unzip

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:49,920
the file, whatever file, and show the content, which is just plain text XML. And that means that, let's say, within

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,130
one century or the next centuries you may be still able to

00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,090
open and read the documents

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:04,950
even if, let's say, LibreOffice or whatever software is not able to do that because it's just a plain text, XML.

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:11,519
And that means also that I'm, what I used to do when I do trainings, is to show the

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,400
text file, the XML file, and show that a human can read it without any software installed.

00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,719
JONATHAN: Fabulous. So, thank you very much and thank you for coming to KDE Akademy.

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,510
GABRIELE: Thank you. Thank you for hosting us

00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,330
