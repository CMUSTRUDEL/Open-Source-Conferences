the presto foundation

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,680

board meeting currently i don't see

anyone from

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,719
absolutely here but you can basically go

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,719
to their website if you're interested to

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,480
see like upsolar.com to see what what

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,600
what technology they are building so

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,360
welcome up solver so we are we are it's

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,840
great to see that we are growing our

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,440
member base in the presto foundation so

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,320
there is one update the second update

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,039
from the tse

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,000
is we are we have recently voted a

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,760
proposal

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
on a charter change about uh

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,320
the committee about separating the roles

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
of a committer and the tse member

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,000
similar to how apache software

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,280
foundation implements

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,640
their pmc and commenter in their

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
governance model

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,680
and so basically the the proposal is a

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,840
small one

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,119
it is pull request number five in the tc

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,640
repository you can go

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,720
take a look at it and it has been

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,759
approved with with by

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,840
everyone in in the tsc so we are gonna

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,600
merge that polycast closely and then

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,200
close the voting session closely so so

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,439
thanks everyone for watching

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,880
so we discussed this in our last tse

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,520
meeting so i don't want to go into the

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,000
details of that proposal but basically

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,320
at a high level it separates the role of

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,200
a commenter and the tse member

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,960
and please take a look at it it is like

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,119
i said it's pulled request number five

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,880
in the presto db slash dsc repository

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,399
and if you have any questions

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,320
you can just comment on the on the

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,240
request and

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,799
having said that like these are my

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,759
updates from the tse front

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,399
i think we can turn to dipty for all

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,399
these updates

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,840
