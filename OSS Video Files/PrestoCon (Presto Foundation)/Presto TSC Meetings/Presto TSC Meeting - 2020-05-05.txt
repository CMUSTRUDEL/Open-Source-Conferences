definitely welcome everyone to the

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,880
Presto Foundation technical steering

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:21,660
committee meeting May 5 and today we

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:25,230
have four agenda items the first one is

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,689
about our events pressed events the

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,130
first one around the the ritual press

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,619
the meetup that we had around two weeks

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,469
ago and the other one is about our plans

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,840
for the first presto con that was

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,000
cancelled - that was postponed due to

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,800
the co-ed situation the second agenda

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,379
item is around PR number 43 which is the

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,250
basic policies there are added to the

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,500
readme the third item is around PR 46

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,620
which is some additional policies and

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,129
procedures around the TAC governance and

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:04,799
the final item is about the occurrence

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:08,909
of this TSE meeting so let's start with

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,560
the first one and I also see like a gin

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,470
Shahjahan so we now have the majority

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,119
okay so you don't have the quorum so

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,500
that's necessary the first one I met

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,150
yeah cable is given overview of the

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,159
mutual prem submitted event maybe some

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,159
you know interesting observations some

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,140
numbers and also give us an update about

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,799
the press the phone plans please yeah

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,009
absolutely

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,560
Thank You Nancy good morning everyone so

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,020
a quick update from the event that we

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,960
had as you know because of the current

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,030
situation we are unable to basically do

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,970
any kind of in-person meet up for a

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,970
foreseeable future so we decided to

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,729
explore if an online meetup would

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,280
basically work as a good substitute so

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:57,530
we had three speakers you know from

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,540
Facebook and uber about 10 days back

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,420
present on three different topics and we

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,570
used our existing meetup group to

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,660
promote this event we had a pleasingly

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,569
good response you know over 150 people

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,780
did sign up and at peak I remember

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,790
seeing about 100 and

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,280
eight people attending pretty much

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,319
sitting through the entire event so

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,030
given you know as an experiment I think

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,470
this went really well

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,230
so we have been discussing in the

00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,290
outreach team to make this into a fairly

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:32,050
regular monthly cadence and you'd be

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,230
seeing a call for requests for two more

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,230
speakers going out for our being an end

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,600
of main event so I love to you know get

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,550
your support and you know we look

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,200
forward to getting to speakers from this

00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,959
pool or people that you can recommend

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,830
who can you know do a quick online

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,800
meetup for us so that went well at the

00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:56,350
same time you also know we had been

00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,780
planning our large presto Kahn event

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,510
which was supposed to be essentially our

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,160
big go to go to party and you know

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,489
announcing to the world what we are

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,940
doing our roadmap but that got cancelled

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,519
as well we were waiting for the last few

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,319
weeks to see if the situation may become

00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,870
normal and we could consider another

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,329
in-person Meetup but as per the new

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,700
guidelines we are getting from Facebook

00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:23,890
and perhaps other companies as well

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,310
pesto corn in person does not look

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:29,890
feasible again for this year so with the

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,920
help of Linux Foundation we are now

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:36,519
exploring an online platform to

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,620
basically take Questacon online they had

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,620
you know couple of days back shared with

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:44,920
us a number of options on how we can

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:47,590
host pesto Khan as a virtual event and

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,540
we are going through a bit of pros and

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,239
cons of each of these platforms to make

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,510
a decision as well as evaluating certain

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:59,470
dates you know that have been floated

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:03,310
around we could do that as early as you

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,769
know July middle of July to another date

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:09,040
that was floated out was perhaps doing

00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:11,739
it in September which is you know also a

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,829
one-year of the foundation of forming of

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,780
the Presto foundation so a consensus

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,989
hasn't been reached but hopefully in the

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,740
next outreach meeting we will be able to

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:25,570
agree upon a date and you know give

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,100
ourselves enough time so that we are

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,160
well prepared

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,660
and can run this event virtually I would

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,990
love to hear if somebody has any

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,090
specific thoughts about you know what we

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,340
are doing with the meetups and pesto con

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,960
that we can take back to the outreach

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,960
and have a discussion around that

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:59,220
thank submit any any questions or

00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,220
comments forum it around these events

00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:12,000
okay obviously I have an essay I want to

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,240
add one more point you are not so much

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,310
related to the events but an interesting

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,000
opportunity that the Facebook open

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:23,010
source team has been exploring a couple

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,920
of months back if you remember we had

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,870
some discussion about you know a good

00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,570
press to be part of the google Summer of

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:34,740
Code which essentially what it does is

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,660
gets people working on tasks that the

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,930
open source team has created on a

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,640
certain project and you know basically

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,460
get a lot of people to start supporting

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,200
those projects now when we discuss that

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,270
it looked like it's going to be a fairly

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,520
significant overhead in terms of having

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,610
somebody do you know monitor and watch

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,470
what is going on but recently we did a

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,030
partnership and this was actually just

00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:02,520
yesterday between github ourselves and

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,650
major league hacking this is a company

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,800
that is running a very similar program

00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:11,490
it's a 12-week paid internship program

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,920
and our team is a sponsor of that and

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,870
what we are doing is looking for open

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,320
source projects where we can put these

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,990
interns to work on a specific task or a

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,750
set of tasks they're the big difference

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:28,170
between this and the google Summer of

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,210
Code is that this program a also pays

00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,760
people so people who actually sign up

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,190
for this get paid internships plus they

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,440
also actually include a mentor as part

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,450
of this package so there'll be a

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,180
dedicated mentor for these group of

00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:44,790
interns working on a project that mentor

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,500
also gets aid which is kind of nice so

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,140
you know it becomes like a full-time to

00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,960
ask for them and the project teams do

00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,660
have a say in picking and selecting who

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,000
the mentor should be so they've really

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,270
ironed up this model really well and

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,040
opening this up as a virtual internship

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,990
opportunity given so many companies have

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,570
cancelled you know internships this year

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,660
I thought I'll at least bring it up to

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:13,170
the TSC to see if you know this could be

00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,000
of value to our project as well and I'll

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,770
obviously share more details in email

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,870
you know after this call but I just

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,680
wanted to call that out and love to see

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,919
if we can you know

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,479
consider you know sponsoring or you know

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,699
at least you know backing this

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:31,440
particular project for Christoph so I'll

00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,720
send more details out you know after

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,190
after this definitely the sounds were

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,570
interesting so thank you thank you very

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,490
much for sharing so any any questions or

00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:50,130
comments for Amit before we move on to

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:53,610
the next item okay so let's move on the

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,259
next item is about PR number 43 Bryan

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,550
you want to provide some context on this

00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:01,250
sure so these are the 43 and 46 to the

00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,889
to PR so we've had open for a while

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,810
these are the policies and procedures

00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,580
the things which were left deliberately

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,130
ambiguous in the technical charter which

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,320
the TSC can then you know to find around

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:17,430
whatever processes make sense for them

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:19,080
given the project and today what I was

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,490
hoping that we could do was maybe a

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,510
review and figure out if there are any

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:26,760
last remaining questions or concerns

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,130
ideally since we have quorum it would be

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,780
nice to vote on one or both of these if

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,529
not then we can defer it to an email

00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:38,490
phone so just maybe running down through

00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:40,200
the history here we had discussed a

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,700
variety of the different options there

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,890
were a number of things which could come

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:48,120
up in the past which have been added one

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:51,120
of the examples is forum requirements we

00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,680
discussed making sure that you know that

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,320
the quorum requirements are set

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,000
appropriately based upon attendance and

00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,070
if somebody has deactivated who would

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,900
otherwise count towards quorum that

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,190
there's a threshold after which they no

00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,770
longer count towards quorum and it

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,060
doesn't block making it decisions one of

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,640
the other things we discussed was

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,320
initial term and how often new members

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,630
should be coming onto the TSC and how

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,570
often elections should run the idea

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:18,300
there was to make sure that when we have

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,130
an election and new people come on we're

00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,079
not having such a large number of people

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,180
you know potentially being replaced that

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:25,709
there would be brain during we think we

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,779
addressed that by saying it's a three

00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:31,470
year term and then roughly a third of

00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:32,970
the TSC is up for election each year one

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,450
of the I guess one of the questions

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,010
which

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,810
wasn't fully resolved for schnazzy and I

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,050
had been discussing on the thread was

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:42,000
how do we select at least initially who

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,430
is up for election who see is up for

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,860
election next year and the year after

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,090
because we're starting this up now can't

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,560
have everybody on a three year cycle

00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,470
because then we'll be replacing

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,870
potentially the entire TSE or 40s CC

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,990
will be up for for voting at the same

00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,180
time so one of the options is to allow

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,680
people to say you know self nominate and

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,120
say I you know I'm willing to sit for a

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,840
one-year term and then put my seat up

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,850
for election obviously they can run for

00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,040
that seat again the other way to do it

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,750
is just randomly say there's a certain

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,490
number you know put together a

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,130
spreadsheet and with everybody's name

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,250
next to it and then decide randomly

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:22,530
who's going to be you know one year or

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,180
two year or three year initial term of

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,910
course once we've done that then the

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,550
seat is a three year seat after that

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:32,190
initial period so I think that ones that

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,200
may still be an open although that's

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,570
more of the mechanics of the process of

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,580
deciding how to stagger at the seats and

00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,940
then the last thing that we had that was

00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,610
an open was determining eligibility and

00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,240
this was you know determining whether or

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:51,930
not a person needs to be a committer in

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:57,900
the Presto project in order to be

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,220
eligible for TSC seat and we in the last

00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,070
meeting last few meetings we had

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,750
discussed that maybe this could be

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,210
loosened a little bit as long as we had

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,830
a reasonable set of criteria and a

00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,590
reasonable nomination form to collect

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,090
information from candidates where they

00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,800
could express ways in which they have

00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,870
contributed to the community that might

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,740
not be reflected in having a committer

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,110
ship on the project so I pushed I pushed

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,960
a template yesterday Rebecca I saw that

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:28,890
you had commented on this thank you and

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:32,130
there are I think that that really

00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,900
concludes the last open question did I

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,910
miss anything does anybody have any

00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,410
other concerns that that we haven't

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,410
addressed so far with these policies

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:56,050
okay um so I guess I would ask is there

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,670
anything that I can provide here or

00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,820
would it help to do a run-through of

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:05,080
these documents one more time are there

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:08,260
any concerns about voting what do we

00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,940
like to review anything I'm trying to

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,160
strike a balance here between you know

00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,589
keeping these open for for a few time

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:22,959
but also getting to the point of running

00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:26,190
a vote so we can declare them done so I

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,980
have a question like regarding the

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:32,140
statement initially the TSE randomly

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,790
design made one third of the seats to be

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,250
one-year terms whatever there will be

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,130
some two-year terms etc so we talked

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,680
about randomizing and selecting one

00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:45,160
third in some way with some process so

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,350
at that point like so that means let's

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,950
say we have ten committers like three of

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:55,180
them will be up for reelection and let's

00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:58,540
say like we like two questions here one

00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:01,959
is so can these people who are out for

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:06,850
reelection be nominated again absolutely

00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:09,010
yep is it clear in this document I think

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,860
we made it clear and if not I can

00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:16,649
definitely make it clear okay and this

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:18,850
second one is let's say sorry let's say

00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:21,430
some of these Co meters that are up for

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:25,899
reelection said like I don't want to be

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:27,640
reelected so at that point I think what

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:29,920
is gonna happen is like they will still

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,350
committer access so they should still be

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,339
pom eaters but they are not on TSE right

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:37,870
yes then this means we have made the

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:39,910
bill basically made a distinction

00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,550
between a committer and the TSE member

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,050
which we haven't made so far so that

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,470
there will be some difference we will

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,850
have leave now so far we have never

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,380
thought about that like you didn't make

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,449
it in the distinction between promoters

00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,250
and tses but with this change we will

00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:58,510
also make that distinction

00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:02,170
at some point yep that's correct and I

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:04,060
just paste it into chant that under term

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,380
of TSE voting members we have text in

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,850
there it says there's no limit to the

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,960
number of times an individual may run

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,190
for an open seat and then I mean we

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,160
certainly could put something in here

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,600
and say that if if a TSC voting member

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,670
who's a committer is no longer on the

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:27,550
TSC they retain their their committer

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:30,570
rights yeah any any any questions or

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:33,370
comments from the TSE about the PR 43

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:36,730
there's there's plenty of I don't see

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:40,060
good you know get the questions right

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:42,820
now and save some discussion and I guess

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,390
the the sales combination form is pretty

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,710
recent

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:50,970
Ryan added recently so if any questions

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,970
about that it would be good to bring up

00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:56,200
food hope I can share my screen here and

00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,040
just walk you through the self

00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,040
nomination form

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,840
okay so up on the screen this is the

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,150
self nomination form and there are a

00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:18,320
couple of things to be aware of here

00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,940
one is that I defined a basic process

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,860
here for what the self nomination would

00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:26,690
look like for each election I've been

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,580
thinking of these in terms of classes so

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,160
there's a class of twenty twenty one who

00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,070
had served from 20 21 to 20 24 there's a

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:38,210
class of 20 22 who has served from 20 22

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,420
until 2025 the idea would be each year

00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,830
we create a new folder underneath the

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,380
denomination's directory that contains

00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:48,280
all of the text file nominations for

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:51,290
people who are you know interested in in

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:55,340
sitting in that is sitting in a seat and

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:59,870
so the hope here is to have a track

00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:01,760
record where we can see and when time

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:05,110
comes to the election we can point to

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,540
all the different nomination files and

00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,950
what I'm suggesting here is that when

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,750
somebody wants to nominate themselves

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,880
they will just copy and paste this

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,790
template right here into a new file and

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,860
then answer the questions recent

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,380
leadership contributions would be areas

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,810
where somebody has made some sort of a

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,390
contribution to leadership of the Presto

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:29,030
community this could include things like

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,830
being a committer or it could be you

00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,220
know leading some sort of an initiative

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:36,140
on the TSC even if you weren't a member

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,930
or participating on the governing board

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,520
or something like that I think we also

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,520
should capture recent technical

00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,160
contributions so essentially a very

00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,870
quick quick summarization of the things

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,900
which you have done within the technical

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,910
community examples could be features

00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,190
you've developed or documentation or

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,290
test coverage that you've enhanced or

00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,450
something like that we had also

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,520
discussed as well there can be times

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,110
when somebody's contribution may not be

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,150
technical but it may be non-technical

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,580
and they may provide a perspective or a

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:10,310
viewpoint which is not currently you

00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,370
know covered within the TSC membership

00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:15,350
and it may be useful to have them there

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:17,000
so there may be non-technical factors

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,950
which should be considered considered

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,810
here so that could be it

00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:24,120
you have a specific area of expertise or

00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:27,030
a specific industry affiliation that is

00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,530
relevant to the things which is GSC is

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:32,100
addressing it's something you should

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,600
come out in the nomination form there's

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,070
also a forward-looking statement on what

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,990
you hope to achieve in your term on the

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,700
TSC and as well just a catch-all at the

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,440
end of this which is you know what else

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,270
should the members consider when they're

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,580
considering your nomination and I am

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,490
putting length requirements on these six

00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,350
sentences or last 12 sentences or less

00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:58,140
so that it's reasonably easy to parse

00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:02,420
through these does anybody have any

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,420
questions about this did I miss anything

00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,860
so maybe I can ask a question so there

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,929
was some discussion in the past weeks

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:35,590
about the the the TSE member candidate

00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:38,320
whether they should have code

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,400
contributions and technical expertise

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,520
with presto I guess several TSE members

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:49,110
wanted as a wanted ad as a prerequisite

00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:52,870
so should we have a section in this

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:54,550
nomination page the template has some

00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,410
technical contribution part but like in

00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,960
the south nomination page about some of

00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:04,890
these prerequisites so that we maybe do

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:07,420
early filtering out sure could say

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:10,980
generally the ideal candidate would have

00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:14,940
a track record of technical contribution

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:22,450
that justify the basic expectations

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:24,880
that's right hi this is Ben's I'm from

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:28,720
Alex you just one question simple

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,550
question do we are we working on the for

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,700
example what's the differentiation

00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:35,290
between the committee and TSE member

00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,760
because previously you briefly mentioned

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:39,730
about this I just want to see if there's

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,610
any documentation I can look through so

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,559
what we're working on right now

00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:46,990
originally well actually let me let me

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,420
take a trip back here to give the full

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,400
context so the way that the technical

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,920
charter is written it defines the

00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,230
initial membership of the TSC as being

00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,480
the committers and the idea is that this

00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,600
allows the TSC to bootstrap itself and

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,030
then it also leaves open that the DSC

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,140
can determine for the future once it's

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:11,260
been formed how the who is eligible and

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,240
how TSC members are selected in some

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,920
projects they choose to say okay it'll

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,900
just be the committers of the project

00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,720
we'll just leave it at that and we'll

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:22,030
keep it simple other projects will say

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,550
we would like to have in addition to the

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,900
committers of the project or or

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,940
separately from the committers of the

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,990
project we'd like to be able to have

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,710
other people beyond the

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:35,890
TSC as there may be some perspective

00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:37,450
which is brought by doing that you know

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,220
it may be that somebody has a certain

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,510
industry perspective it may be that

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,110
somebody has a certain technical

00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:47,020
perspective that is not related to the

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:49,500
to this project in particular but is

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:52,300
related to something which is important

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,340
and the whole point here the to how to

00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,470
bring in bring it all full circle is

00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:01,660
that the TSC can essentially use its own

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:04,540
discretion in determining who is

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,340
eligible to be a TSC member it's just

00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:09,190
important to have it documented and

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:12,820
consistent and so what we're working on

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:15,340
here is just making sure that when when

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,710
anybody fills out a self nomination to

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,090
be on the TSC whether it's a committer

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,090
or whether it's somebody with

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,290
non-technical but relevant experience

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,690
that they are all being considered

00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,780
equally using the same set of questions

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,950
and criteria does that make sense yeah

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,900
that makes total sense

00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,850
maybe I was just a little bit confused

00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,550
or by the term committer

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,429
do we here mean someone who ever

00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:41,800
contributed any code to the source code

00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:44,200
repository or this is another election

00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,700
process called commit early you know

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,110
like for a party project there is some

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,840
central process process

00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:52,929
ah good question so yes committer is a

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,450
defined term it's a capital C committer

00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:58,809
where the Presto project decides amongst

00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:01,540
itself who has decision-making rights as

00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:03,720
to what code can be applied so we would

00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,580
consider somebody who's written code and

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,380
open up a PR that person would be a

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,150
contributor in the terminology that

00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,250
we're using here the person who actually

00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:15,580
merges the PR and has the rights to

00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,870
merge the PR would be the committer so

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,780
those are the the distinctions

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:23,200
contributor versus committer Thanks and

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:25,630
to add to that like so the personal

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,000
project has some committee guidelines on

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:31,150
the github wiki pages you can take a

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,580
look at that to see what what makes a

00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,870
contributor committer and the other

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,150
thing that you can check is in the

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,490
Charter it there is there are some

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:42,310
statements about the procedure of

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,990
electing a new committee and how

00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,310
you need a majority of the words of

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,230
existing committed etcetera so there's

00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:51,570
some information bits there as well we

00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:51,570
are in competition thank you

00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,730
coming back to this self nomination

00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,890
document any any questions for Brian or

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:16,270
any comments about this stuff domination

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:17,920
forum or maybe PR 43 in general would

00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,180
there be any concerns with taking a vote

00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,180
to Landis today

00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:28,249
we can iterate on the on the nomination

00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:31,339
templates that's we're not going to need

00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:33,940
that until later on this year but as far

00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:37,639
as the rest of the policies

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:40,159
everything's discussed here you know

00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:42,769
having the list of collaboration tools

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:47,769
the members the the terms of the TSC

00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:53,769
voting members how to become a member

00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:56,889
eligibility okay Thank You Rebecca

00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:59,479
this wasn't a formal vote better but

00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:01,580
I'll call that separately I just wanted

00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:04,309
to make sure so Rebecca's good with that

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:07,629
anybody else have any concerns with

00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,629
moving forward on a vote on this

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,340
okay wait I just have a question about

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,570
this boat

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:24,330
sure so because it's a regular boat does

00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,740
that mean there's like one Facebook

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:33,580
representative who is voting because of

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:35,259
the yep that's right so it's one vote

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,210
per company if there are less than six

00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:39,580
companies represented as voting members

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,929
so the voting members are companies

00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:49,450
represented as voting members or

00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:51,100
Facebook Twitter and uber okay yeah so

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,570
with that though like maybe it may be

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,879
better if we take it offline that

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,230
because we are missing many commenters

00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:58,960
from the Facebook site it would be good

00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,899
to capture their opinion and then come

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,899
up with that single world for Facebook

00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:06,580
okay sounds good umm I will take an

00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:08,500
action to send that email right after

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,190
the meeting yes I love to follow up with

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,190
commenters

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:23,470
perfect okay great um which that should

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:25,210
bring us to the next topic which is PR

00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,289
number 46 which is effectively the same

00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,549
thing but there haven't really been any

00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:31,509
discussions on this one that I'm aware

00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:34,950
of

00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:37,299
I think this one's been pretty stable

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,950
this is the one that includes

00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:45,970
information on making decisions and it

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:48,159
includes a section on gifts and policy

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:52,389
on on how to merge PRS against the TSC

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,070
repository and these are some guidelines

00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:55,899
which we've used in other projects which

00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,639
would work reasonably well which is

00:25:55,899 --> 00:26:01,299
where if there's a change to something a

00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:05,919
change to a policy that the the TSC

00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:07,690
has has developed where you know a PR

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,309
would remain open for a certain period

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,740
of time there's time for people to

00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:14,669
object you know things can be

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:18,220
fast-tracked if it's something which is

00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:20,559
reasonably reasonably trivial or which

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,779
the TSA members have said this is okay

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,929
in a meeting but basically what this

00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:28,000
avoids is a situation where somebody you

00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:29,230
know opens a PR to change

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,900
see and then it just kind of goes

00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:35,380
through without others having a chance

00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,750
to weigh in so that's in here under

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,960
merging PRS into the TSC repository and

00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,370
then there's just general stuff in here

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,910
about you know links off to the IP

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:50,430
policy notes on SPD x short form

00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:50,430
identifiers copyright notices etc

00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,320
anybody have a question about this one

00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:24,360
all right so I think I will send out

00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:24,360
this one for a vote as well okay all

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,430
right I think that's ahead does he

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,540
thanks Brian

00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:37,690
so okay so going to the last item about

00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:41,200
the cadence of the TSE meetings this

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:44,790
meeting so Gail you want to draw it

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:48,460
takes on this one sure thanks Nancy um

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:50,560
when we initially began meeting as ATSC

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,720
in December it was proposed that we meet

00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,090
on a bi-weekly or twice monthly basis

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,990
during the initial bootstrapping period

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:01,420
as there are more topics to discuss and

00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,100
more action items to stand up the

00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:07,230
organization now that we've been

00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:10,210
together for several months now it was

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:13,630
discussed or asked if we should move to

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,850
a monthly cadence instead of meeting

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:19,780
every two weeks just to give us more

00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:22,360
time to pull together content and make

00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:26,520
more valuable use of your time are there

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,520
any questions around that in the group

00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:35,049
and Brian is something that we would

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,779
need to have a complete vote on or how

00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:39,610
we move forward of this one consensus is

00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:41,049
fine if there are no objections to

00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,840
moving to monthly we can just move this

00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:52,240
to monthly okay are there any objections

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:52,720
to moving to a monthly meeting okay then

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,000
Brian

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,289
I'll take action to update the series so

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,149
we'll start meeting on a monthly basis

00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:05,740
every four weeks instead of every two

00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:07,629
weeks excellent thanks okay so this

00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,320
concludes the items in the agenda so

00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:12,639
before wrapping up are there any other

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,500
topics that anyone wants to bring up or

00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:15,850
any other questions or comments around

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,570
any of these items that we have been

00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,570
through today

00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:31,440
I have one thing so this is a shell from

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,470
Twitter I think now we are about to set

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,740
play the TSE and meter so what here see

00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,830
some of the things it's nice tweeting

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,960
about it and make it clear for example

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:45,600
in Apache community well either yes he

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,230
can determine who is committer I'll

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,650
revoke the community is a et cetera all

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:56,070
the things we already have some token

00:29:52,650 --> 00:30:03,720
tation acting enticed we make sure other

00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:05,190
things are clear so g-shock chain you

00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,200
may be like it would be good if you can

00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:09,270
add some of these details as a comment

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,280
to the pr 43 i guess that would be

00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:15,030
really good to capture it on the pier so

00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,830
that maybe we can extend up here sure

00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:24,480
yeah a little bit would be like a

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:28,049
follow-up discussion so that I get the

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,510
the order of operations correct here is

00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:31,950
this something which we can land the PR

00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,330
as it is right now and then refine this

00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,659
or would you like to have this in place

00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:39,179
before we lay on the PR oh we can land

00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:40,799
up here that's good yeah this is just

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:44,600
for suggestions for following topics

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,600
okay sounds good

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,210
so basically your comment is mostly

00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,309
around the separation like there are

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,830
responsibilities around TSE versus

00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:58,890
committers and definitely defining them

00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:00,809
yeah yeah I think I would definitely

00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,730
agree with that like given if you decide

00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:05,070
to go that route of separating the two

00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:08,250
bodies then we really need a Chris Chris

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,080
crystal clear definition and differences

00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,610
and responsibilities so they'll be very

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:18,679
good to capture in all of these

00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:18,679
documents that make sense

00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,050
any other questions or comments before

00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,640
we wrap up about anything or any any

00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:32,760
inner item that you want to bring up

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:35,730
