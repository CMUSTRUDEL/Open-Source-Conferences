there will be multiple talks from

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:58,410

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,189
we will share the zoom links and other

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,610
connection information in the next few

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,610
days probably

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,740
so the and we can move to the second

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,130
agenda item which is about reviewing the

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,060
changes to the readme file Brian can you

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:24,119
give us some context about it sure so

00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:28,530
there are two new poll requests that are

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:31,259
open I open these up yesterday and one

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,189
of them contains basically the changes

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,140
that that the TSC has already reviewed

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:39,750
and these are you know some of the

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,780
expansions on things like how and when

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,490
to choose TSC members and you know what

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,540
the election process the nomination

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,430
process looks like and all of that I had

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,100
broken these out into a separate PR just

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,500
because I think they've been discussed

00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:00,390
and and we've reached general consensus

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,130
on most things and it would be nice to

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,659
get this merged and basically just to

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,759
get it done so that is PR 43 and if you

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,680
I'll drop the link into the chat here

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:17,090
and also

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,090
pull it up on my screen and share it

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:50,400
okay there's two PR and just a moment

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:54,079
I'll share what's in here okay so there

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,900
are a few changes in here and basically

00:02:54,079 --> 00:03:00,090
we have everything we discussed

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,549
previously adding the terms of the TSC

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,019
voting members in the last meeting we

00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,599
discussed having a three-year term

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,510
instead of a two-year term so the less

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,150
of the TSC is up for up for replacement

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,769
at any given time and this is reflected

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,639
here so now it's one third of the seats

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:19,470
are elected each year that's the only

00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:23,340
change from the last time you saw the

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:27,870
draft that we have here the other thing

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:31,139
was that I removed the the line in here

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,260
that was about needing to be a committer

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,879
in order to be on the TSC and the reason

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,290
I removed that is the still under active

00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,389
discussion in fact this is one of the

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,150
agenda items later on and I wanted to

00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:44,069
hold off putting anything in here lest

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,319
this hold up the rest of the PR I think

00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:47,459
the rest of this is reasonably

00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,609
reasonably well discussed at this point

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,680
so one of the things I'd like to suggest

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:55,859
and like to get your your input on is

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,409
whether we can put this particular chunk

00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:04,590
of text up for a vote so we can just get

00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:06,900
it merged and done so any any thoughts

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,530
on this any concerns with doing it this

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,930
way breaking it out into pieces I got a

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,879
question like you elaborate on the

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:21,380
changing the composition of the TSC

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:24,360
section a bit yeah so in the Charter

00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,310
bring up the actual page in the shorter

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,010
here

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,800
in the Charter the total number of TSC

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,690
members is set to 15 unless the TSC sets

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,210
a new maximum limit by supermajority

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:39,750
vote so the charter grants the TSC the

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,910
ability to to increase or decrease the

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,320
number of TSC members or sorry the

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,669
number of TSC seats that are available

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,620
and the reason for putting us in here in

00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,419
this particular way is that the most

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,000
sensible time to adjust the size of a

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,560
TSC is at election time that's the

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,419
easiest time because then we can ensure

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,940
there's balance and you know that the

00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:02,669
classes the one year two year and three

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,370
year classes are roughly roughly

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,350
equivalent to each other otherwise this

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,700
can be done really at any time and the

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,410
the TSE just needs to have a

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,770
supermajority vote from the existing

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,460
voting members so kind of bringing all

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,890
this together

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,330
nezzie to answer your question the

00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,890
reason for putting in here this way is

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,750
to suggest that if there are going to be

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,000
changes the most opportune time to make

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,729
those changes is around a vote it's just

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,830
logistically much easier that way but at

00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:34,110
the same time it's put into the Charter

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:37,440
where it can happen at any time thank

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:41,030
you sure does anyone have any other

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,030
comments on any other sections

00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:07,870
alright should we move on to the next

00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:10,479
yeah we can move on to the legs next one

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:15,069
folks if you have comments please drop

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:20,199
your comments on PR 43 and then we can

00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:24,669
continue the conversation there okay the

00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:27,969
next agenda item is PR 46 and this adds

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:30,639
some additional policies and just maybe

00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:33,789
for some context here I've been working

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,469
on trying to roll out some policies

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,330
across a variety of different projects

00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:39,550
here too that seem to be helpful

00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,020
elsewhere and we haven't discussed these

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,030
yet which is why I broke these out into

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,909
a separate PR I didn't want to hold up

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,729
the you know the work on the other I'm

00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:50,080
getting the other one merged but there

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:51,669
are a couple of things which would be

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,440
which would be added starting here at

00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:55,599
the policies and procedures heading and

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,879
moving down and I'll walk through each

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,560
one of these in turn I'm not asking for

00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,210
a vote or suggesting vote or anything I

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,560
just want to get everybody comfortable

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,940
with these ideas so you can start

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,289
thinking about whether or not these make

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:10,870
sense for the press no TSC so the first

00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:12,520
thing here is aligned on making

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,680
decisions and this is just basically

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,539
echoing the language from the Charter

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,180
which says that decision is up on a

00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:21,509
consensus basis and then if consensus

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,159
isn't reached then a vote as possible

00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,690
it's also adding and here that votes you

00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,279
know are taken over email and documented

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,199
in the next meeting this is fairly

00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,539
standard practice it's easier to track

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,759
there's a record of the vote that sort

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:37,300
of thing

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,279
the next thing is a policy which I'm

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,199
proposing here which other other

00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,990
projects have used about how and when to

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:48,240
merge PRS into the TSC repository and

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:50,830
the TSC repo is kind of a special

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,719
special entity given that it's largely

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,520
documentation of procedures and

00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:57,520
governance and things like that

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,110
and so what other projects have done is

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
they say there are certain requirements

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,919
that have to be met if we're going to

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,599
change one of the policies or one of the

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:09,130
governance items and you know the

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,419
numbers here the requirements here these

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,380
are all flexible but they're just

00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:12,700
basically put here for your

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,850
consideration

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:20,680
one of them is there no minus ones you

00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:22,180
know this this does allow if TFC voting

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,570
member has serious objection to

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,550
something they can hold the merging of P

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,940
R which changes governance or changes

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,919
policies with a minus one there's a

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,770
minimum number of approvals required and

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,780
then also a minimum time and the idea

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,900
here is that we are in a virtual team

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,390
we're not always going to be meeting you

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,850
know we meet every every month or every

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,520
few weeks or sometimes over a few months

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,020
if that's the case it's kind of

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,550
important if there are going to be

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,170
changes to give people enough time to

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,110
review them taking into account time

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,200
zones weekends and PTO and so that's the

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:01,240
reason for for having you know a few

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,920
people explicitly sign off and for

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,480
having a PR be open for a certain period

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,460
of time the other thing to be aware of

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,380
here is that changes to the Charter are

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:14,080
explicitly mentioned in the last section

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,850
of the Charter so there are it is

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,950
possible for the TSC to update the

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,130
Charter by two-thirds vote supermajority

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,740
vote what this adds to it is the amount

00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:31,180
of time it would take before declaring

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:32,920
that that this is done and basically the

00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,180
last thing that's in this section does

00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:39,430
you know discuss this a little bit on

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:41,520
the on an issue last night is if if

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,050
there's a meeting that has quorum and

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,150
has sufficient voting members in order

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,460
to pass you know a vote on one of the

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,080
PRS then it can just be done live in the

00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,430
meeting you know there's no reason to

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,840
wait out the entire period if

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:56,140
everybody's there and discussing it

00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,140
anyhow so it's kind of a it accelerates

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:03,880
this process a bit does that all make

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:06,220
sense as a as an idea does anybody have

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:11,610
any thoughts or concerns about about a

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,610
process like this make sense to me

00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:25,509
No all right great so the next section

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,220
is about fast-tracking and again this is

00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:29,050
just adding some structure around what

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,329
happens if there's a trivial change like

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,709
you know for example if if I were to

00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:35,529
push something and have a spelling error

00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:37,569
and somebody wants to change it it would

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:40,209
be ridiculous for that to wait 72 hours

00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:41,889
for a fix so certain PRS can be

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:45,730
fast-tracked if they meet the criteria

00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:48,600
here errata or editorial changes or

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:52,149
uploading meeting minutes or whatever

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,740
and essentially this basically if you

00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,620
were to open a PR you can add a

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,120
fast-track label and then a few people

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,180
sign off on it and then it just gets

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,560
merged so the idea here is don't don't

00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,980
create a waiting period for things don't

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,850
need a waiting period on the other hand

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,860
changes to the charter this does say

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,649
that changes to the Charter would not be

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,089
fast-tracked because those are usually

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,949
things which require a substantial

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,810
amount of deliberation and want to make

00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:24,550
sure that everybody's had a chance to

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:37,500
really read and digest any questions

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:39,850
about this one all right and then

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,949
there's just a few more things in here

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,899
there's a link off to the IP policy

00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:46,689
generally good idea to at least link off

00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:50,800
to this in a variety of different places

00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:52,899
so it's more discoverable the Linux

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,670
Foundation with regards to copyright

00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:57,220
notices in files Linux foundations

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,980
published some guidance on this for

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,220
community best practices of you know

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,740
commute contributors to files if you are

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,930
making contribution to to one of the

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,300
files in the Presto repo you don't

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,790
necessarily need to add a copyright line

00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,129
to the top of the file in fact in many

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,550
circumstances we don't recommend it in

00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:19,899
all of this detailed behind this link

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,790
this is one of the reasons for

00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,829
suggesting this and and for including

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,819
this in the readme is that this is one

00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:26,300
of the areas where we get a lot of

00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:28,640
questions

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,320
contributors will ask ok you know at

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,630
what point do I need add my copyright

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,810
line is it is it essential that I do

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:38,030
this and really the only rule the only

00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,950
rule is really hard fast and set in

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,440
stone is do not modify somebody else's

00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,780
copyright notice as for everything else

00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,480
the thinking I think has evolved on this

00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,790
over the years and now essentially

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,530
there's you know we're trying to keep

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,080
the the headers of files as clean as

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:57,110
possible and minimal as possible so if

00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,670
there's no specific reason to add it the

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,810
guidance here is you know you don't

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:04,580
really need to bother with that speaking

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,730
of keeping things clean and tidy in the

00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:11,200
tops of files we also do suggest that s

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:15,440
PDX short identifiers are a good way to

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,880
to signal license information and this

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,940
can be useful in a couple of different

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,980
senses one is that it's a very minimal

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,510
way of indicating a license on a file so

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,000
if that file is likely to make its way

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,970
into other repos or other projects it's

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,590
clear what the license was and it goes

00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,700
with the file it's not a file in the

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:36,980
repo itself and the second reason for

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,100
doing this is that it does help out for

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,500
automated code scanning so it's it's a

00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,120
hygiene thing we we don't you know in

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,040
other projects we don't mandate this

00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,720
it's not a requirement but at the same

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,180
time if you're making an edit to a file

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,620
and you see there's no license

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:59,600
identifier at the top of the file it's

00:13:51,620 --> 00:14:01,160
relatively trivial ad and those are the

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,010
changes does anybody have any questions

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,130
about these any concerns with any of

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,130
these

00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:16,580
III get one question in the merging pr's

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:19,130
into the TSA poster section the last

00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,140
sentence like if consensus cannot be

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,240
reached can you elaborate on that

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,510
process when the consensus is not

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:31,640
reached yes so essentially this is

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:36,230
saying that if if there's not agreement

00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:39,730
and a vote is forced then the vote would

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:43,130
override the objections so for example

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,480
you know that well in a situation where

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,910
there's something which is somewhat

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,910
controversial and most of the TSC

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:52,640
members agree but one person is objected

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:54,560
that objection prevents there from being

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,420
consensus so you can't say there's a

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,970
consensus merge you know we can just go

00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,430
ahead and put this in at that point then

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,230
it does require a formal vote Gaylor I

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,930
can organize that we'll send out the

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,640
email collect the responses and if the

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,140
vote comes back with the majority saying

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,650
this thing should be merged or

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:15,650
supermajority if it's a charter change

00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:18,950
then at that point the PR can go through

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:23,510
so there can be a block you can you can

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:29,900
block something from consensus but the

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:33,290
block is can be overridden by a vote and

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,450
then it says like to override

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,370
outstanding objections basically if you

00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,520
can't override like multiple objections

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:43,820
until late unless objections are the

00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,290
majority right so correct yeah it's just

00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:51,020
in function it's the same as a normal

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:52,870
vote right yes in in a normal vote even

00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,310
when you even when you object if you're

00:15:52,870 --> 00:16:01,190
if the majority are going the other

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:04,600
direction then the vote passes yeah any

00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,600
other questions about this PR

00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:18,809
okay so this was peer 46 and Fox please

00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,879
review it and then please leave some

00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:22,619
comments and feedback now we can

00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,739
continue a conversation offline in the

00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:28,489
TSE repository and i guess we can move

00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:31,199
to the next agenda item which is

00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:33,629
eligibility to be on the TS c which is

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,629
TS c which is the issue 38 on the

00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:51,769
repository Brian you want to give some

00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:55,619
context on this one okay yeah so this is

00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:58,879
one that we have been discussing for the

00:16:55,619 --> 00:17:02,069
past few meetings and this is the one I

00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,350
removed this from the the rest of the P

00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:07,559
R so that we could break this out as a

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,600
separate conversation and the question

00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:14,269
is what should the requirements be in

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:17,639
order to be eligible for a TS c c and

00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:20,339
originally we had had in here that TS c

00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:24,299
members should be committers or must be

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,529
committers and there's been you know

00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:27,839
there are a couple different ways to do

00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:29,730
this one of one of them which many

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,070
projects will do is they'll say you know

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,799
TS c members a certain percentage of the

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,940
TSC members are committers or you know

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,370
there's certain number of seats that are

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,110
reserved for people who are not involved

00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,730
in code development and wouldn't get

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,580
code development or code committer

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:49,549
status we had a discussion in the last

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:51,840
meeting that this can sometimes lead to

00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:53,340
situations where people who are not

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,320
actually contributing code gain

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,039
committer status so that they're

00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,919
eligible for the TSC examples would be

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,559
you know folks who work on maybe

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:08,190
documentation or end users or situations

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,049
like that but at the same time this is

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,450
the you know this is very particular to

00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:16,350
each project right so each project has

00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:18,360
different different requirements for

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,100
what you would need to do in order to be

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,190
eligible for TS c c

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,350
san shou had some suggestions here it's

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:29,700
the the last comment on the thread here

00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:32,490
that maybe if if the person doesn't need

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,220
to be a committer explicitly maybe there

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,809
are specific things which they you know

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,940
specific conditions which they would

00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:41,549
need to meet proving that they have

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,450
sufficient technical expertise and a

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:47,400
sufficient commitment to the project I'd

00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,890
like to open this up for suggestion it's

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,910
up on the screen here or opens up for

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,380
discussion

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:56,179
sunshine would you like to add anything

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:59,280
to to what I just described there oh

00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:04,230
sure yeah that's just my thoughts on

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:07,169
that and I was thinking even if the

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:11,280
let's say the new TSE member he's not

00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:15,299
contributing code are not contributing

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:18,720
lots of code but he needs to be very

00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:21,210
involved in the community and also half

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,770
the DS I and also contribute some amount

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:27,690
of code and be familiar with the

00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:32,760
community so that's myself so the things

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:35,220
in my mind is four items one is he needs

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:40,169
to be active in code review for the past

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:44,100
year and also he need to driver to

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:46,530
designs these parties he didn't do the

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,929
coding out he to some of the coding it's

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:51,750
one of the design and he also tried the

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:54,809
incantations and finally the features

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:57,870
emerged and also he needs to be in

00:19:54,809 --> 00:20:00,750
expertise in at least one specific area

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,750
for somehow optimizer a connector or

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,909
some other things and also he need to be

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:09,330
RTV in coal kameez for the past year

00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:11,669
this means he he may not be contribute

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:14,900
as much code as the other commuters but

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:17,640
he needs to contribute some code yeah I

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,530
love to see what other others think

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,799
about these things is these are just

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,799
myself

00:20:38,510 --> 00:21:14,130
any other thoughts on this one Fox sure

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:16,950
take this one yeah I was just gonna say

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:21,540
that I think that those four

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:25,440
requirements are maybe a bit more strict

00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:27,240
than I would be inclined to impose as

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,920
far as like I'm thinking like if you

00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,830
have someone who is more like

00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:38,400
documentation or user side or focused on

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:42,510
you know some particular you know

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,429
connector or integration I'm wondering

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,230
if they would meet those requirements

00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:49,830
and I could imagine that they could

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:52,160
still be valuable contributors to the

00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,160
TSC

00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:02,259
you know my thoughts on the

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,029
documentation side for example so

00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:06,850
pressed out the documentation is also

00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:10,539
Unicode rate alright so if someone

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:12,909
driver I say he or she comes to do a lot

00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:16,419
lots of things to the documentation that

00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:18,999
he already have a number of commits to

00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:21,039
the code repo so for doc means

00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:25,899
documentation side that that shouldn't

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:27,879
be a problem for the other side I do

00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:33,190
know however I do not have a Splunk

00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:37,299
inning I do not know how can we evaluate

00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:42,539
I say he's a strong user or strong

00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:42,539
customer yeah this part I'm not clear

00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:47,679
even for the documentation example that

00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:51,369
Rebecca gave which i think is a good

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,820
example like jeans are like how about

00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:56,889
item two in your proposal but you say

00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,649
like proposed two plus big feature

00:22:56,889 --> 00:23:02,200
design so that basically rules out any

00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:07,960
commenters that haven't contributed any

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:10,179
major design changes like how strict is

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,379
your proposal about item two if you

00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:15,970
consider all these four items as a must

00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:17,649
that would that that may be a bit

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:21,490
illustrator and filter out a lot of

00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:23,320
folks know at least number one these

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,409
four things just I give my mind I'm not

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,570
saying is a must to meet all of these

00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:31,960
and I'm thinking about these for the

00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,700
non-compete thirty Isis yeah I would say

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,789
you someone become a commuter he

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,619
automatically become a DSC and the for

00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:41,289
if we are thinking about someone who's

00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:44,350
not a committer I think we should be

00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:47,169
strict because how can we evaluate

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,679
someone has the contribution to become a

00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:49,679
DLC

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:05,460
any other comments from special editor

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:11,550
from TSE members on the call or

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:14,310
questions maybe I'd miss this but it's

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:16,200
the idea that that all of these things

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,150
are required or that the there are some

00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,500
of these required or that these are

00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:24,000
guide posts to basically say this is

00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:28,050
this is the type of thing that we're

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,940
looking for do i maybe elaborate on that

00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,910
a little bit yeah again this is just in

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,570
my mind I'm not saying this is a we

00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:40,140
should do this I allowed to see how they

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:44,970
are thinking about these I think for you

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:47,190
someone become a commuter then I do not

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:50,550
have other requirements for non-compete

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:54,690
rtic these are the four such graduate

00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:56,850
items to be meet non-community yes okay

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,860
so one of the things that I can suggest

00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,250
here in other projects what we've done

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:05,520
is we have a nomination template and

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:07,500
self-nomination template that people who

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,780
are hoping to run for a seat would have

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,400
to complete and essentially it's you

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,230
know as a candidate in information form

00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,420
it's here are the things which I have

00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:17,550
done here's why I think I'll be you know

00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,470
helpful - very useful in the seat and

00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:23,100
here's why I think that I would be a

00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:25,260
strong candidate and one of the ways

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,280
that other projects have handled this

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,560
where they say there are certain

00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,920
criteria we'd like to see is that they

00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:36,600
include those as examples in the

00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:40,320
not-self nomination template and you

00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:43,800
know essentially not having all of the

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:47,400
boxes checked would not be a blocker but

00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,140
at the same time it does give candidates

00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,780
an idea of what they should have done or

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:54,530
what they should be talking about so the

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:57,450
the people who are doing the election

00:25:54,530 --> 00:26:01,460
can have a reasonable reasonably

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:01,460
informed election and that makes sense

00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:10,910
yeah yeah I mean if we are doing this

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:14,179
purples and room mode I think that's

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:16,700
good by the existing committees and TSE

00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:19,250
members to approve that I think that's

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:24,410
good yeah this is just my suggestion

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:28,160
items because I think we should be have

00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:31,130
something to quantify the evaluation for

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:35,809
now personally follow me Turkey Aziz

00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:40,370
yeah Michele I don't feel like having a

00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:46,580
like non qualified ruse to allow any TSE

00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:49,640
members to be nominated is especially we

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:53,150
need to like put lists as I hate at

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,450
least for some post like if some of TS

00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:58,549
members they are not committers

00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,470
contaminated we need to have some at

00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:11,750
least some examples hey welcome a

00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:15,020
contribution this guy has been down okay

00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:19,309
so then to help us move forward here how

00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:21,500
about how about I take a take a crack at

00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:24,350
drafting a nomination template

00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:28,640
self-nomination template that includes

00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:31,299
these things you know says please please

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,380
describe how you've how you you know

00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:37,429
what you've done that would qualify

00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:39,470
under these particular criteria and then

00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:41,320
maybe that'll help if we can agree on a

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,059
template then maybe that'll help us

00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:52,100
determine whether we've got the criteria

00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:53,980
right yeah this sounds like a good

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:58,100
starting point for further discussion

00:27:53,980 --> 00:28:00,440
okay and like in other projects do other

00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,150
projects have strict quantifiable

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,820
guidelines like this or is it more like

00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,040
a judgement call from the existing TSE

00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,679
members it is almost always a judgment

00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,770
call and the reason for that is that

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,640
whenever there are strict guidelines

00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:16,929
almost immediately there will be an

00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,929
exception yeah

00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:23,729
yeah at the same time if it's totally

00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,799
wide open then you you know it's very

00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:27,479
difficult to actually evaluate various

00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:31,729
candidates particularly if you have a

00:28:27,479 --> 00:28:34,349
limited number of seats so I think

00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:36,239
considering these as guidelines so that

00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:38,820
you can evaluate stronger versus weaker

00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:40,919
candidates certainly helps but then

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:44,190
having that flexibility to select

00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,469
somebody who maybe wasn't anticipated or

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,029
contemplated when when the guidelines

00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:51,389
were created that's also very good as

00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:53,399
well I think I think I like the idea

00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:55,619
that when people self nominate they

00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:58,440
should explicitly tell how they have

00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:00,659
contributed in the past and like we can

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,429
have at this some soft guidelines like

00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:04,409
evening share like King Charles or like

00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:07,139
James mentioned it's also some soft

00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:09,629
guidelines and then the TSE will just do

00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:11,639
their judgment call and then decide you

00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:14,339
know I think that sounds like a good

00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:16,679
start yeah yeah

00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:19,440
so just gonna say it also it helps with

00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:23,009
transparency in all directions so for

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,259
example you know somebody say say nezzie

00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:26,519
if you were running then then you would

00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:29,549
be following up the same template as

00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:33,570
everybody else if we have this and it'd

00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:36,989
be you know it provides a fair amount of

00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,279
of transparency in the process so

00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:40,339
whether it's somebody who's completely

00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:43,950
new somebody who's just getting started

00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:45,719
whether it's somebody who has been here

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:55,830
for a long time everybody's doing the

00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:59,580
same thing okay I think like we can move

00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:02,279
to the last item and like if folks have

00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:06,149
any other comments it's this eligibility

00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:08,399
is the issue 38 on the TSE repo so

00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:10,259
please take a look so the last item is

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,809
creating yet pressure foundation

00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:18,059
directory no Bryce again back to you

00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:20,549
back to me so I have been writing a few

00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:24,169
github actions recently and one of the

00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:24,169
ones that I've been doing is one that

00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:28,950
creates a directory of various people in

00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:30,870
various teams in the

00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,960
object and then also creates and manages

00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:36,529
mailing lists behind them the idea here

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,690
we use group style for the mailing lists

00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:41,639
it's not always clear who's supposed to

00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,549
be on what lists like for example the

00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:46,919
TSC list or if there are code of conduct

00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:51,510
panel or if there were other other

00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:53,190
working groups and I mean Gail or I can

00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,299
always create these lists we can help

00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,549
moderate them and we can help manage

00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:58,590
them but it's oftentimes better if the

00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:00,990
project can do that themselves because

00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,730
then they have you know a lot more

00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,940
direct control and Gail and I are at the

00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:10,529
bottleneck to give you an example I have

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:21,559
one of these up for open J's foundation

00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:21,559
give me just one second to find it it is

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:28,110
right here this is what it looks like

00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,549
we've only got a few teams on here cuz

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:36,210
I'm still in the process of onboarding

00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:39,330
folks let's go to see how show director

00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:44,490
it's so for the cross project Council

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:46,710
and the idea here is that I you can

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:49,350
create a directory of who you're voting

00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:52,610
members are I this is all created

00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:54,750
dynamically from a from a mo file but

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,510
voting members the members of a

00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:00,360
particular group various community

00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,950
health links and then you can point

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,870
people to this and say here's who the

00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,490
leadership is of this particular project

00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,679
so the press note ESC you here's who's

00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,350
on the TSC here's where you find our

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,360
various ways to contact us here are

00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:15,899
links to our governance your the people

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:21,059
here are the repositories and it's all

00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:24,000
configured based upon a base to get

00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:25,769
based upon the mo file so that if you

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,909
want to change your own information if

00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:29,250
you want to add yourself or remove

00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:30,929
yourself from the list you don't need to

00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,130
go log into groups that IO you don't

00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:33,929
need to ask for somebody else to do it

00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:37,230
for you you can just open up or request

00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:39,450
and do it yourself so the idea here is

00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:42,720
let's make everything as self manageable

00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,730
as we possibly can is this the sort of

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,289
that would be useful for presto if it is

00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:49,020
I can set it up and handle all the

00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:50,760
configuration and then at that point you

00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,890
know if there are any other mailing

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,870
lists you'd like me to create and manage

00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:57,210
this way we can do that or is it

00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:08,970
something that would be you know not

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:11,640
useful I think it would be useful

00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:16,590
because currently the information is

00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:19,110
kind of distributed across other places

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:21,840
like for example the slag Twitter

00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:23,940
whatever all these communication

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,340
channels are listed on the Presto DB

00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,679
website and the maintainer of the

00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,390
project are listed on github they are

00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,460
like distributed around I think it may

00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:35,130
help to have them centralized so that we

00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,770
can just share easily and i publicize

00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:40,950
easily I think that would be one benefit

00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:55,789
of it I don't know what other folks

00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:58,620
think yeah it's a good idea all right

00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:04,440
does anybody have any concerns I mean do

00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:05,789
we have consensus here I can also

00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,919
prototype and show you what it looks

00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:11,240
like and then you can decide that's

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,030
probably the better way to do it yeah

00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:20,690
sounds good sounds like there are no

00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:23,970
objections okay cool

00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,500
okay so I will take an action

00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,330
I'll get this set up and I'll send it

00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,339
out yep thank you Brian

00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,320
so this was the last item but I would

00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:34,169
like to go back to the first item again

00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,609
because I see I'm it on the line I'm it

00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:37,740
can you can you also give some

00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:44,129
information about the virtual events on

00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:49,710
April 24 please how can you hear me yes

00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:53,339
okay so let me just switch to my mail

00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:56,220
here so on 24th April we are looking to

00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:58,410
do a small virtual Meetup

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,780
this is essentially that something that

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,280
we promote to our meetup group in the

00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,800
Bay Area and a couple of other channels

00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,800
that we have on strike and Facebook and

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,050
LinkedIn to basically just stay

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,940
connected to that community the idea is

00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:15,230
that we have two speakers right now from

00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:19,200
Facebook and we're going to talk about

00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:21,890
sequel functions and I think the other

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,240
one is from Android restaurant spark

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:26,490
20-minute presentations with a small

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,849
with a small Q&A and we'll do it over

00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:32,940
zoom so I'll be getting out the invites

00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:35,220
along with my colleagues at uber we're

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,430
also helping me out get this up and

00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,470
running yeah that's pretty much it a

00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:42,869
very simple meet aware this experiment

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,490
thing given the circumstances right now

00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:47,220
that people won't have a chance to do

00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,630
any physical meetups we are trying to

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:55,140
stay in touch with our community through

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:58,130
that any specific questions comments

00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,130
from folks

00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:11,900
yeah thank you very much a metaphor for

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,630
for the information so we are out of

00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,339
agenda items before we wrap up are there

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:29,630
any other items that you would like to

00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:32,359
discuss right now looks like there

00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:36,380
