right now okay we are now recording a

00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,629
heroin

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,570
welcome to July 7 edition of the press

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,940
ODB TSE meeting so it's been a while

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,490
that we haven't come together and today

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,250
we were fairly light with agenda and we

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,980
have one item to discuss from my ink and

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,460
it's about having the idea of having a

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,750
test land filled in it appears Mike can

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:31,740
you please provide some context on this

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:33,899
one hello everyone so my name is Mike I

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,010
brought this up in a conversation with

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,989
Nessie around having one of Kara

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,450
changing the template of a get a pull

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,460
request and adding the field of test

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,100
plan so this is something that we

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,219
already have inside Facebook in an

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,230
internal code review system where people

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,449
need to add a test plan the motivation

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,600
there was mainly that to kind of catch

00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:01,320
more attention to how people are testing

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,019
their changes and having the committers

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,659
or other reviewers review the test plan

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,890
and along with the code so it's really

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,680
important to actually kind of take a

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,060
look at and see that appropriate testing

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,930
has been done for the change that's

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,780
being forced and this is kind of coming

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,380
because a like within Facebook as we

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,270
have been doing kind of rollouts we have

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,270
seen certain changes that have kind of

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:35,220
sort of impacted bills and their broken

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:38,040
trunk and in addition to that as we are

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,900
kind of like at least within the part of

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,159
my team that I'm in facebook we are

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,810
actually looking forward to making

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,340
bigger changes architectual e so like

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,680
even in that sense it's gonna be good to

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,390
kind of provide the visibility to the

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,479
reviewers to the community as to what

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,719
kind of testing processes were used so

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,100
yeah that's kind of the high level

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:04,649
proposal just a simple change in github

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,619
template up for the PRS and then the

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,539
committers would basically take a look

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,069
at the test plan before actually

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,989
accepting and merging and kind of

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,709
commenting on a test line up along with

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,709
the actual

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:21,110
thank you my any totes

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:38,050
um raka I think it's a great idea I

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,310
think it's helpful to cuz it draws

00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,380
attention if the test plan is

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,260
particularly sparks whereas sometimes

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,670
you might miss that through the process

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,170
of just reading through the commitment

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,170
so I think they'll be very helpful I

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,710
have a question

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,600
versus rural is this the test plan in

00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:03,640
the commit message or just plain the

00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:06,040
pure I I was thinking about the beer

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:11,080
because that's generally the most

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:12,550
visible area but we can consider the

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:19,720
commit message like I don't really have

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:21,610
a very strong preference like normally

00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,080
we kind of like peer is more associated

00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:29,680
to like a future so it makes more sense

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,890
to have like a germinal tests I agree I

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,190
think I said and we can always point to

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,510
coming back to a br so it's not that

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,010
it's going to be very difficult to kind

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,480
of looking at a comma just figuring out

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,950
how to test it so it should be fairly

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,370
straightforward to go the other way

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,370
around as well

00:03:52,810 --> 00:04:01,879
any other coast from the sloop so I

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,939
guess we have Jean Chou and James joins

00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,650
recently so we are discussing whether we

00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:08,719
should have a test plan filled in the

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,840
github pull request description when a

00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:15,260
new PR is open so that the contributors

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,060
or whoever has altered that patch has

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,220
properly tested it and given a thought

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,690
about it and we are discussing whether

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:26,870
we should have something like that so if

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:29,440
you have any toes please share I think

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,440
that's a good idea

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:48,960
and Brian like for change like this

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,680
should we get this board to make this

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,050
change in the template no I mean really

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,300
for something like this where it seems

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,940
that there's you know general consensus

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:09,360
then voting is voting is extra overhead

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:11,460
yeah okay oh okay so that is that is the

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,370
only agenda item that we have today does

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,370
anyone have any other items to discuss I

00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:25,080
see I think the one reminder that this

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,400
meeting gave me was that one of the PRS

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,850
here does need to be landed that we were

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,700
discussing terms of governance which was

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:41,490
that I'm trying to remember if it was 43

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:43,290
or 46 you know a second here okay

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,560
one of those was water then you know

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,060
accept it yeah and was the simple one

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,570

outreach team reach out to them to

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,030
basically discuss you know what they

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,680
have been using in production and you

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,840
know basically just talk about that so

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,430
it's a slightly different talk compared

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:45,849
to the kind of talks that we have done

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:50,009
before any specific questions Thank You

00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:53,069
Amit so any questions or any other

00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:58,240
agenda items that you want to bring up

00:07:53,069 --> 00:08:01,199
anyone wants to bring up otherwise we

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,199
are out of I I don't right now

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,820
okay it looks like we don't have any

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:26,640
other items to discuss it was a fairly

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:28,680
quick sync up and Brian do you have any

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,400
other items to bring up anything else

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,670
you want to remind or bring up um not at

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,670
this point I think you know we're going

00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:43,020
into the summer and there's going to be

00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:45,440
a lot of people out and so probably a

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,600
slow season is somewhat to be expected

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,970
pretty normal in projects so yeah this

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,580
is good okay then I think we can wrap up

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,740
here and thank you everyone everyone for

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,300
