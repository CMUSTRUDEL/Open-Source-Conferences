okay here we go we're recording now okay

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,640
hey everyone

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,320
uh welcome to the october 6th edition of

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,559
the presta foundation technical steering

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,759
committee meeting

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,080
so we have uh several items on the

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,400
agenda today

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,039
and the first one is about the the

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,359
committer and tse member separation that

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,039
we

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,480
briefly had a discussion about that in

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,240
the past as well

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,840
but uh we would like to bring that up

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,679
again and discuss

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,960
and there is an item about an update

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,559
from the outreach committee

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,559
from deepti and there is the last item

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,480
is about discussion of the role of

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,920
architects in in the presto community

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,160
again by dipty

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,920
so i'm going to start with the commiter

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,480
tsc member separation discussion and

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,200
then pass it to deeply after that so

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,879
currently if you look at the charter of

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,879
the technical steering committee

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,800
you will see that the charter talks

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,440
about multiple

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,520
roles multiple things it talks about the

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,760
contributor it talks about committer and

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,640
it talks about tsc member

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,960
and so these these notions these roles

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
are

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,439
kind of weakly defined in the charter

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,439
and basically

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,960
based on the charter the it says

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,080
currently the tse

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,640
is equal to the committers

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,040
so going forward to to make the tse

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,080
structure more flexible

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,840
uh we would like to separate the the

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,560
commiter and the tse role more clearly

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
in the charter and that will basically

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,320
help

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,600
us uh manage both set of bodies

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,280
independently and in a much more

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,560
flexible way

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,240
so this means like when we like when

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,560
there's a contributor in the community

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,200
that contributor can be nominated as a

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,439
committer

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
based on that person's contributions and

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,240
then the that committee later on can be

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,079
nominated as a tse member

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
so that is that is the that is the model

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,000
that we have in mind and

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,280
that is currently being discussed by the

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,119
tse and is the

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,360
the definitions of these are being

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,799
formalized so that the distinction is

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,080
much clearer in the charter and

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,479
uh so any any questions about that any

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,479
thoughts

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,200
good or bad like how do you folks think

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,480
about the direction about separating the

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,959
the both bodies

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,959
of people

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,760
yeah so uh nazi a quick question on that

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,680
um

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,599
uh uh are you what does the tse

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,280
comprise of then if this if there's a

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,640
separation like this i think it's really

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,560
first thing i think it's

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,400
really good to have specific roles

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
associated and understand them

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,560
a little bit better uh but kind of

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,720
asking a clarifying question on the on

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,640
the separation of the roles and

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,560
um maybe you can share a little bit more

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,680
about the t what the tse would do and

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,879
what the committees

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,640
would do and and initially uh our st are

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,560
all our committers still a part of the

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,920
tse

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,000
so it will be similar to like how apache

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,959
software foundation does it like

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,800
committers will be doing the day-to-day

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,720
maintenance of the project right they

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,480
will run the project they will

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,000
you know review pr check in the code

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,720
whatever and initially

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
since currently we have tse equal to the

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,959
committers

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,799
then i think once we make this change

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,360
the existing people should still be in

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,159
the tsc it will be too much

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,560
uh hassle to really restructure that

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,239
okay

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,879
so and after that like the the new tse

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,560
will be similar to apache pmc where

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,360
established committers

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,680
will be the tse members who will deal

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,720
with

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,640
again they can help with the day-to-day

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,840
activities since they are they have the

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,680
committee rights

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,439
as well as they can contribute to the

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,159
long-term oversight of the of the

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,519
project

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,519
similar to what they do right now

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,080
yup got it yeah i was just gonna say it

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,680
uh sounds similar to uh

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,239
uh the asf model so yeah three-tiered

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
model

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,920
um the tse is more focused on the

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,280
oversight

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,360
overall um and uh and actually

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,720
i have a topic that's sort of related as

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
well so we'll get to that

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
yeah we'll get to that in a bit yeah any

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,079
other comments yeah definitely any other

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
comments about

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
this change like i said the status of

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
these changes is still being

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,280
discussed and the details are being

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,639
finalized they're trying to formalize

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,880
and capture the definition in the

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,560
charter and once we have that formal

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:43,840
change we will put it up for voting and

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:43,840
share it broadly

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,880
[Music]

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,520
okay so then i'm moving on to the next

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,600
item

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,120
so dipty do you want to start with the

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
role of architects first maybe since

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,880
they are

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,759
that's more related yeah um yes

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,600
uh giving you one sec so one of the

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,120
things as it as it relates with

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:13,120
uh uh with uh

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,639
the the discussion the change that uh

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,160
nazi was talking about uh is the broader

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,280
goal of making the community more

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
vibrant right

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,880
and as a part of that there's multiple

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,759
roles multiple people play

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,720
different roles in the community um and

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,479
uh currently

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,720
the the committees were a part of the

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,039
tsc and that's it's great to hear that

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,520
that's uh uh you know that there's more

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,680
uh governance that's uh that's uh

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,960
uh that's being thought on on top of

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,639
that another

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,680
aspect is um the uh the design and

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,800
architectural

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,440
um uh kind of a role and

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,080
guidance that the project gets and

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,639
bringing up

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,280
a couple of slides here so just keep

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,280
bear with me

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,600
um and so this

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,319
the reason i brought this up today is um

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,360
we

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:08,000
had a very very good first presto con

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,600
a couple of weeks ago um the the

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,960
feedback from

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,039
uh presto con was very very impressive

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,880
people the community we've had multiple

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,080
conversations after that

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,880
um where they uh they

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
really love that presto vision that we

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
set we jointly

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,600
said that was shared in the keynote that

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
was shared in um

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,680
in the facebook session in the uber

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,479
sessions uh as a part of the panels

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,360
um and uh you know i just kind of put in

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,960
one of the

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,800
the machine statements here from one of

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,759
the sessions is to be the most

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,400
dependable

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,199
fastest uh engine right analytics engine

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,680
there is

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
and the feedback on this was pretty uh

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,360
uh pretty incredible

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,680
um there are a lot of people looking at

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,599
um they may be in another community

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,759
another adjacent community may be using

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,199
a a different version a different uh

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,240
uh fork of presto but are very seriously

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,199
uh you know thinking about um about

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,520
presto db

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,160
given the confidence and given the the

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,560
depth of the discussions they saw

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,919
and so um i was thinking more about the

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,240
tse as well

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,960
uh and uh the question that i want to

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,520
put forward for discussion is

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,400
you know typically when uh with open

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,800
source projects asf or linux foundation

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,039
the creators the early developers set

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,880
that vision and that architecture

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,639
from the very beginning there's a lot of

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,919
design discussions a lot of designs

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,160
attached to pr's

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,520
some of that may have uh may have been

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,720
lost over time

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,319
and is it the right time to bring in

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,199
uh some more design focus where we

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,919
could have uh advisors or architects or

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,039
you know some

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,759
some role that uh uh

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,199
is adjacent to the committers uh and the

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,240
committers obviously are

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,840
incredibly important to the uh to the

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
project they

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,199
from a implementation a design

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,720
perspective

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,319
but it might be helpful to have some

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,199
complimentary skills for the overall

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,240
project

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,319
um to to assist with that it could be an

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,919
architectural role and advisory role

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,280
um and i'm just putting this is not a

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,319
proposal i'm just putting it up for

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,440
discussion

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,520
uh because the momentum that we've got

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,639
from prestacon i think would be great to

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,879
continue on

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,919
uh and to have such uh deeper

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,440
discussions

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,800
with the broader community where

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,800
architects can lead some of those

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,360
discussions along with the committers

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,640
um and it would be uh it would be really

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
good for the project

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,839
so i'm just uh bringing this up as a

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,159
overall

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,360
uh uh discussion point if there's

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,159
interest uh we

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,680
are you know we can look at as uh figure

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,240
out what the right approach is

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,600
how this fits into tse uh it's a good i

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,600
think it might be a good time to have

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
this conversation given that there's

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,279
overall discussion about the tsc itself

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,760
um

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,560
and uh adding more governance and more

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
thought to it

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,880
to make the project more vibrant so uh

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,240
just some uh thoughts on that uh any

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,480
questions or comments

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,760
uh folks uh nancy as you've thought

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,760
about tse more maybe

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,760
you have any feedback from you

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,720
yeah i think i feel like this

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,760
may be you something like this may be

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,040
useful

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,640
but i know that there's a lot of

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,480
experienced people in our community as

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,000
well who are not committers

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,399
like having them give input or

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,320
you ideas about the long-term strategy

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,480
or long-term architecture of the system

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,279
how it should evolve etc

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,040
may be useful for the community and that

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,080
is that is that is at a high level

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,959
what i feel but what the implementation

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,399
of that like

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,399
do you have any ideas about how to

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,839
implement this um

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,959
i mean there are a couple of different

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,480
approaches um and if it makes sense we

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,760
can have that

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,000
um have that discussion um

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,440
i mean there's a there's a part of the

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,600
tse role of the tsc can be

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,279
can have some advisory uh context

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,399
associated with it right

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,240
um and uh that might be one approach

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,200
um but i mean this is this is a

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,680
um for me this is uh i'm putting this

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,480
out

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,000
as a uh as is the right time to have

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,120
this conversation right you know after

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,880
prestacon where

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,800
we have great momentum and if this is

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,360
serious if if the uh

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,839
the committers and the team feels that

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,079
it's

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,480
good to spend time on thinking about

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,040
this uh we can obviously

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,640
think about doing it the right way and

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,920
using the right approach there are other

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,920
models that we could look at

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,320
and uh and then bring it up for

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,480
discussion uh with the team

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,839
uh anyone else feedback um uh

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,000
zenshaw or others i don't know who else

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,240
is on the

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,240
call

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,120
yeah for the role of architect uh

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,640
do you think the architect only do the

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,839
design or does he

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,640
still do the coding it may be a

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,240
combination

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,480
right i mean i think that you have to

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,000
understand the code to some extent

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,480
uh to uh um uh to

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,279
propose or you know uh suggest reviews

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,120
or changes

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,480
um but uh this is a early

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,480
uh you know early uh

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,240
discussion and so we can decide on what

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
what that would be

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,040
and my uh my feedback would be it would

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,040
be a combination

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,000
could that be a big difference from our

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,880
communities i mean commuters are also

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,959
doing

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:52,000
design on the coding uh good question

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,760
uh i think that it's a maybe a slightly

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,839
uh higher order

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,440
in terms of looking at across components

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,440
instead of individual components

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,760
there are you know

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,560
there's a system level design element to

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,399
it

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,320
which which helps projects um usually

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,600
so we can uh we can have that discussion

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,079
if there's uh if

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,079
there is a feeling that this might be

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,570
helpful

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,570
[Music]

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,360
okay if there's no i think uh there may

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,480
be uh

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,440
some benefit to looking at this so uh

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,639
uh if there is interest we can uh nazi

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,839
will take your lead on

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,639
you know how to work how to move forward

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,290
and

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,560
take it from there and then um

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,120
[Music]

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,639
should we move on to the next uh next

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,760
topic

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:20,639
yeah unless there are any questions we

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:23,760
can i guess we'll move to the next one

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,639
okay uh so a quick update on prestacon

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,279
folks um

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
a very very successful first presto con

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,279
thank you

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,320
everyone for their uh efforts uh i hope

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:38,639
many of you could attend there were

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:42,399
a range of speakers from

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,920
a wide range of companies many

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,320
many different types of sessions so we

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,199
had nearly 650 registrations overall

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,120
which is

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,279
i think the biggest presto event that

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,720
has been up until now so

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,800
um a big congratulations to everyone um

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,040
at peak there were about 200 attendees

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,519
uh probably around you know some part of

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,800
the day

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,480
uh and a lot of people stayed on to the

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,959
end uh there were the

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,000
quality of sessions and the feedback we

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,519
got was the

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,600
quality of the content and session was

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,639
very good um there were nine full

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,320
sessions nine

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,040
lightning rod towers um two panels um

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,160
we uh had seven sponsors and two event

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,760
sponsors as well

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,720
from a diverse city perspective uh

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,000
linux foundation has a very high bar for

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,399
uh for diversity which

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,680
is uh uh which brings in a lot of

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,079
different ideas uh

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,240
and so that was it was great to partner

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,720
with with these organizations

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,560
all the recordings are already on

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,639
youtube so if you haven't had a chance

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,600
if you missed something uh you could try

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,639
it out

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,000
take a look at youtube.prestodb.io and

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:55,279
um uh the

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,480
uh in terms of uh uh feedback so far as

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,079
interesting from a project perspective

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,079
uh disaggregated coordinator with the

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,440
resource manager uh a separate

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,079
um you know n coordinators uh that do

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,880
the

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,880
uh you know planning to execution uh

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,639
analyzer to execution and then

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,480
the workers there was a lot of really

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,320
good feedback on that i think that the

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,519
community will give it a try once it's

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,959
uh available

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,880
uh the other one um that we heard

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,839
uh good feedback on is the native engine

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,240
so basically removing that jvm

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,120
dependency uh

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
ranger uh was the third and uh there

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,759
were

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
three or four different presto routers

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,120
gateways that

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,480
uh that came up through different talks

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,519
uh it might be

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,680
um uh you know good uh

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,360
uh idea to consolidate some of these

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,639
efforts under a new project under

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,079
presto db i think the uh um the twitter

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,800
teams have already open source there's

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,199
other

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,880
other projects as well uh it might be

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,000
good to put some effort into this so

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,880
that there is a

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,360
you know unified approach for um routing

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,480
routing

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,880
across multiple pesto clusters so

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,800
um yep that's it from me uh in terms of

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,839
the presto con update

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,839
uh questions thoughts feedback

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,160
yeah i just want to say like i got

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,920
similar feedback from some external

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,680
people like they they were

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,839
they like they like the content they

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,519
liked how the projects were visionary

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,079
and long term like thinking the long

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,880
term of presto

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,399
it was not just a bunch of features here

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,240
and there it was just like a coherent

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,839
thinking around how to take presta to

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
the next level so there was really good

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,399
positive feedback about

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,399
about all the content actually

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,399
great any comments or questions for

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,480
deputy

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,199
constructive or positive there's always

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,199
room to improve

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,839
all right uh back to you gail and nessie

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,280
okay so there is one more item it's not

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,360
on the agenda

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,880
but being just being me being fan from

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,919
ellipsio so he wants to talk a little

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,520
bit about some of the recent

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,039
collaboration and some of some of our

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,959
luxia's plans

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:22,959
been uh thank you let me share my screen

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,959
i have three slides to share you

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,280
yeah so um i have been working with

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,919
facebook presto team in the past few

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,760
months

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,679
uh basically we're building a presto

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,559
luxury solution joint solution

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,160
and i want to update you the tsc members

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,320
about where we are right now

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,320
and share our plan moving forward

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,240
uh assume you can see my screen right

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,360
unless if you cannot see it

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,360
just let me know so the goal is to

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,480
deliver a high connector caching

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,559
solution

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,160
and to for this particular project we

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,960
want to build a high performance caching

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,679
solution for

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
hive connector uh that's the number one

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,480
number

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,480
two is also to showcase there is a

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,840
organic and very healthy win-win

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,720
situation for the open source

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,200
collaboration

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
across multiple different uh projects

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,039
open source projects

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,400
so we started this project about early

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,640
this year

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,240
when we started from scratch actually so

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,799
alexio is a caching

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,960
system but we here we want to build

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,280
something specialized for price to

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,400
presto solution and basically this

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,400
project

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,320
start from scratch and we have about

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,200
nine thousand lines of code

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,760
and uh to spread over two code bases

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,120
about

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,640
nine uh six hundred six thousand in

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,200
a luxury code base majority of the

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,840
codings in lexico base and

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,280
2000 lines in price the code base mostly

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,520
for integration

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,480
and it's a code development from both

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,200
sides

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,400
since january we see that we're doing

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,559
architecturing

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,039
integration productionization testing

00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,640
together with facebook team especially

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,640
with james rocket k and also xi

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,640
and unlocks your side it's best to me

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,039
and also calvin we are both uh

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,480
founding engineers on the luxo site and

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,799
the feature implementation wise is

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,000
mostly driven and done by me

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,840
and we delivered this to uh as a final

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,200
solution to facebook in mid

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,280
2000 this year and we see very good

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,320
performance like 2x to 10x latency

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,360
reduction

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,480
for various uh workloads in facebook we

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,360
have already seen

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,080
and now it's already been deployed at

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,640
thousands of

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,200
nodes today and we'll keep improving

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,720
that

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,640
well when i interrupt a little bit of

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,880
stay here as like um

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,360
ben and myself and she's trying to

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,919
collaborate a lot on this project

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,960
um as mentioned in the slides we see

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,679
like 10x

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,480
improvement and also this project

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,200
deprecated

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,080
our legacy solution called raptor so the

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,720
raptor connector

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,760
has been completely deprecated by this

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,799
um solution

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,520
with a local data cache and the um a

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,960
remote

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,440
hdfs storage uh this is a huge win for

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,080
us

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,600
and it really thanks like luxo's

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,840
contribution

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,280
though not many alpha lines were inside

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,919
presto cold base

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,000
the core code is inside axial but the

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,600
entire like the new cause of the pr

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,640
single lexical base

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,679
um only contributes to the purpose of

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,520
for this project

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,280
only um also is like being mentioned

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,280
running at thousands of notes today

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,600
actually we're running tens of thousands

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,120
of

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,360
notes today all the interactive fleet

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,240
we have in facebook running presto has

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,200
the solution enabled

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,080
so it's a really big shout out to um oxo

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,080
team

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,679
thanks james i get a lot of help from

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,679
the presto developers

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,720
it's a it's a really good experience for

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,880
me to

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,159
collaborate with the with external

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,960
community and on the

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,600
very awesome uh project and we're we're

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,880
seeing the

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,799
feedback it's really awesome uh so our

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,039
next next slide i want to share some

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,600
planned contribution moving forward

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,679
uh so we are working together uh closely

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,480
on the table quota this is basically

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,000
we already made most of the codes and

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,080
it's in the review phase

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,240
and i'm also working with james on

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,120
supporting ttl this is something

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,720
um some like on the privacy on the

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,159
privacy side there are some

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,720
certain feature requests uh for presto

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,440
to to

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,960
be compliant so we're designing to make

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,120
sure that cash can also be

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,200
compliant with the privacy requirements

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,960
and also we're in discussion of some

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,679
performance optimization

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,039
what we see is sometimes we are running

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,960
presto to query

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,400
a lot of small table files and there are

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,159
certain things we can do

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,320
on the story on the caching side that we

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,799
can do to further improve the

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,440
cache hit ratio and also i'm working

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,760
with k

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,520
closely on improving the coverage for

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,000
the tests we're adding more

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,080
integration tests and also adding some

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,320
uh benchmark on the cache

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,760
uh finally more documentation and all

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,679
these are on the

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,480
in the in in the plan and i'm just

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,480
rolling this out

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,480
uh there's some other community

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,960
contribution and i'm leading the

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,640
alexa team to to do like more code

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,360
review in the prestigious sites

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,919
and i'm helping to uh driving some more

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,400
blogs

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,159
this is i'm by the way i'm also serving

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,200
an outreach committee uh working with

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,919
digi together

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,679
and we already created multiple uh two

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,080
two three articles

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,600
talking about the presto use case and

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,039
i'm driving with more

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:40,000
from jd.com and by dance and also

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,640
uh getting more talks about presto i'm

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,360
joined

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,039
jointly presenting with rohit in scale

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,080
by the bay and also in the luxury

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,880
occupation summit

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,679
uh coming this year yeah this is also my

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,440
shout out to

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,120
uh thanks for all the support from james

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,600
rohit shisha nk

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,240
and all the president team who members

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,320
help us

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,520
on the journey and we will continue this

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,640
journey

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,200
that's all i have today

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,039
well thank you ben yeah thanks a lot

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,559
folks for enabling this collaboration i

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,080
think it was an exemplary collaboration

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,360
where we get a lot of value for the

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,240
community

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,240
so any any questions for ben or any

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
comments

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,840
okay before we wrap up like does anyone

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:51,840
have any agenda items or items that

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:51,840
you want to bring up

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,679
okay then i guess we can wrap up here

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,440
and thanks folks for joining today and

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:11,360
until next time take care
