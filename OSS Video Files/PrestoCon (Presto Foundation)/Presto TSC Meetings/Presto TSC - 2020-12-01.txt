00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,560
optimized

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,280
so for presto uh so that pesto can run

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,360

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,040
on top of it right compaction uh

to these sessions as well in addition

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,599
we'll be adding at least five more

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,840
global meetups to

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,360
reach out to other regions meetups is

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,360
tends to be more local

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,120
and so we're trying to make it a kind of

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,600
a broader outreach

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,759

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,040
very excited about that um and uh

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,919

and so if you have interest in uh the

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,600

or um in sharing this out with the

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,560
broader community

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,080
uh a lot of these slides uh the the tse

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,680
cherokee note

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,919
of the facebook roadmap as well as

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,440
the various panels that we held all of

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,639
these are now available

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,360
uh as well now uh just one more thing i

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,919
want to talk about

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
is the next six months what we're doing

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,120
is we want to build more engagement with

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,400
the community and we're taking a

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,160
subcommittee approach

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,039
to uh spread out and do uh launch and

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,639
work through more programs and so we

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,320
have uh

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,160
four or five different subcommittees for

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,520
different areas for example

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,120
presto con um virtual meetups uh

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,400
engagement uh and uh communication um

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,479
uh commun slack and uh github

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,759
uh workshops is a is an important area

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,720
and so various various members of the

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,320
um of the uh outreach committee as well

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,360
as the extended team

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,560
uh are engaging and working closely on

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,120
putting together

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,720
program drafts for some of these areas

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,320
and we'll start looking at working

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
through these and start driving these

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,080
over the next six months so

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,199
hoping to uh strengthen the community

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,479
and our engagement

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,680
even more over time um a couple of

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,759
things we are planning

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
with the success of presto con we are

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,960
planning a

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,319
um a version of presto con a light

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,400
version of it perhaps

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,319
in the february march time frame details

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,199
are our tbd but

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,960
once we have a basics uh worked out

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,680
we'll have a call for papers uh we'll

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,880
have the

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,880
uh the program committee uh um uh

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,919
created and uh we'll start working

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,600
through the process

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,720
like we did with with presto con so look

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,520
forward to that uh and

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,240
the virtual workshops is a new program

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,360

this and this is really a great program

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,400
