	00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,520
so i'm idong from alibaba and

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,759
i'm the director of the intelligent

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,599
database optimization team

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,719
and today i'd like to share

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,400
uh what we think about the coming era of

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,439
the fast data and

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,000
the challenges behind the trend and our

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,240
design philosophy to build a cloud

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
native data warehouse and the data lake

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,519
analytics to overcome these

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,520
challenges so at first

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,160
why we call uh the era of data is coming

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,399
so let's look at the sum of global trend

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,200
business data first so this is uh most

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,399
of the data

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,120
are from the governor of idc report so

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,239
at first

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,960
i think that um right now uh in the year

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,640
of 2020 uh we have uh like a

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,440
40 zb business data that's a huge amount

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,879
of data

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,039
and we can see the uh the fast growth of

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:04,559
the business data

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:07,600
by 2025 with i knew full uh 430 percent

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,640
growth and among this uh

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,640
the data uh i think the real time

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,159
data itself will cover the 30 percent by

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,520
uh by the year of the 2025

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,640
and we can see by 2022

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,840
and 50 of the analytics will be the

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,360
real-time analytics

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,400
in the new business and

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,680
we can see the uh more and more machine

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,560
learning on the ai

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
application and business analytics and

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
which

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,200
covers about a 40 about 80 percent of

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,479
instructor data and we can see the the

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,960
growth the annual growth

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,960
of uh will be as high as a 55

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,600
and also um among all those data they

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,960
can see that the 49

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,560
data will be unclogged by 2025

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,840
and 75 of those data will be

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,840
uh precised by a cloud database

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,840
and by 2020

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,120
so um so given a global trend of the

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,599
business data

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,959
uh what challenges that conventional

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,840
analytics system

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,879
will face so the first thing is that our

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,440
first challenge is

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,160
the complicated data so we can see the

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,920
uh the

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,560
the data warehouse will uh will

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,360
import or will handle the different data

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,040
sources

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,040
for example the the tp the the old oltp

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,560
transactional data

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,840
and also the log data and also the

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,120
the data from iot or streaming data

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,720
for example in alibaba we have different

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,920
resources like rds mysql data and

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,959
table store and oss data which is the

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,080
kva store and also sls which is

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,120
log data and a lot of other uh

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,840
the big data hadoop ecosystem data so

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,319
that will

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,519
be that will make the uh the datasoft

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,239
very complicated

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,360
and the conventional analytic uh

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,080
analytics

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,080
system will have to handle all those uh

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,319
complicated data but it will

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,760
introduce a huge amount of complexity in

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,040
the system

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,720
and also uh for the conventional

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,840
analytics systems so if you already

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,879
introduced the

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,319
etl which uh they will

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,480
result in a t plus one under x right

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,519
so that's the conventional how we

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,319
precise the big data

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,959
and also the the system is uh itself

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,000
will be

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,640
very very complex for example we have to

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,400
um

00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:00,400
uh incorporate different components

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,159
uh from hdfs from uh to the to keeper

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,799
to the uh high flying all different kind

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,720
of

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,920
components so it will make the whole

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,599
analytic system

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,360
very very complex and it's also very

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,120
hard to maintain

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,680
and to to manage so make the operation

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,639
cost is very high

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,240
and also the linear cost is very high so

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,280
it's not just about

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,720
the thailand salaries also about the

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,360
technology itself the linear curve and

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
because to lending such a new technology

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,320
is very very high

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:43,840
so all these challenges has to be faced

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,840
have to be faced by the analytic systems

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,360
so we believe the the future

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,280
analytic system should have the

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,919
capabilities to process

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,880
the fast data instead of the big data

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,479
only

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,720
so we can see the uh the nowadays the

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,759
the big data has um the volume

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,080
ver variety and the velocity

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
and the variety all those kind of

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,240
different aspects

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,919
so it required the uh the next

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,280
generation the native system

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,479
can uh fully can precise the all those

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,199
kind of uh

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,199
different formats of data and also

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,240
precise that those data in real time and

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,960
also the

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
because uh there are real-time data

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,280
coming in

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,160
so the system has to be able to

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,440
uh to process the those real-time data

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,800
at the same time

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,560
and since given the huge volume

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:49,120
and the velocity of the uh of those data

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:52,000
so the he already required a lot of

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,720
computing resources which is resulting

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,199
in a large-scale cluster of systems

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,759
so um we believe that cloud-native

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,880
nature

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,560
could help this because

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,639
the computer resolve the computing

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,720
resource can be allocated

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:12,639
on demand and the elasticity will help

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,639
customers to reduce the cost

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,120
so this is uh to overcome

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,160
the overall the challenge of the fast

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,560
data

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,639
we designed and developed our new

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,319
generation of cloud native data

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,000
this warehouse in the data lake

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,039
analytics which

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,199
is a consolidated data storage and their

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,520
processing solution so we can see

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,560
in the middle is our two main product

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,680
one is the

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,800
analysis db uh which is a cloud native

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
data warehouse

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,039
another is a data lake analytics um it's

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,240
a cloud native data lakes

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,560
and my colleagues james c uh from

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,400
uh introduced the dead lake and latest

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,720
in this morning session

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,520
so so with these two products we can

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
connect to the different these sources

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,120
and

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,560
process the real-time

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,360
data and a large huge amount of the data

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,080
in the real time and provide the

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,520
business

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,240
insight to the customers by connecting

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,039
by supporting the different bi and

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
applications

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,440
for example kbi type blue all those are

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,360
popular

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:29,280
bi applications so

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,240
and and so they did cloud data warehouse

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,639
product another db so we provided two

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,599
different

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,560
compatible uh products one is to compile

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,960
device uh

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,880
compatible with mysql another is

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,440
compatible with the postgresql

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,800
this is because in different regions of

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,319
countries uh

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,400
uh the the the single uh ecosystem

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,520
is different quite different for example

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,280
in in china

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,080
in china in china the mexico is dominant

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,759
but in

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,440
the u.s and or in europe the post-grad

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,919
sql ecosystem is dominant so we provided

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,039
two different types of uh

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,319
products to uh to accomplish

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,360
to uh to handle the the requirement from

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,479
the market

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,800
so this is the the general uh

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,160
picture so given the time i i want to

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,479
dive into the detail

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,599
but if i have any questions you can uh

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,120
contact me

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,120
