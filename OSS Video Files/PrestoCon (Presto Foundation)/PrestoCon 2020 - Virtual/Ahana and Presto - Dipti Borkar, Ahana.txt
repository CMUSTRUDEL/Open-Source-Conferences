hi everyone i'm deepti borkar and i'm

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,319
the co-founder and the chief product

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,320
officer of ahara

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,000
thank you for joining us at presto.com

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,679
today

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,519
in this session i'll introduce you to

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,160
ahana share a little bit about

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,640
our open source roadmap for presto and

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,880
demo a hana cloud for presto

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,560
a fully integrated managed service

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,119
that's built for aws

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,240
and then runs on kubernetes and i'm very

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,800
excited to announce

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,720
that it is available today i've got only

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
five minutes and a lot to talk about

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,840
so let's get started

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,960
ahana is a self-service analytics

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,840
startup for presto

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,399
we're funded by google and support the

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,960
the original presto project preso db

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,320
the honor team is made up of presto and

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,079
database developers

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,680
who have run presto at pretty large

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,640
scale at uber

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,079
walmart and alibaba most of us come from

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,160
open source backgrounds

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,199
and are extremely passionate about

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,000
contributing back

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,359
to the community we are working on a

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,960
range of projects

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,840
to make presto easier for the community

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,920
some of these include better connector

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,479
support for example we're adding

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,600
csv support for the format support for

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,759
the hive connector

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
uh we're looking at adding an iceberg

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,119
connector as well

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
and improving uh security with open

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,799
source

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,040
apache ranger plug-in we're also looking

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,720
at a range of caching strategies

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,960
at different levels of abstraction

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,920
now the power of presto is pretty

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,799
fantastic

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,439
but it's still out of reach of many data

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,000
engineers data platform developers

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,360
who may not have deep distributed

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,320
systems backgrounds

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,799
or knowledge of the hadoop ecosystem or

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,479
experience with open source projects

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,799
some of the things that might be

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,119
involved in managing presto

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,320
on your own include a lot of

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,079
configuration

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,040
including adding catalog properties for

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,920
data sources restarts for many of those

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
changes

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,479
as well as managing a meta store like a

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
hype meta store or glue outside of

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,360
presto

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,480
and more so that's why

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,680
we built a hana cloud the easiest

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,400
presto experience let's take a look at

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,200
the service itself the ahana cloud

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
includes

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,480
the hana sas console as well as

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,360
the ohana compute plane the compute

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,879
plane is orchestrated by the sas console

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,680
in your own aws vpc so you can provide

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,319
your account

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,360
and pick a region pick availability

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,440
zones

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
and create the compute plane within your

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,680
account

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
now once the the the compute plane is

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,200
created

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,200
you are ready to create presto clusters

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,519
here you see that i already have a

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
a few presto clusters up and running

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,760
some are active

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,519
some are in the stop state and if you

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,319
want to add a data source

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,920
to this to these clusters it's very easy

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,120
to do that you could go in and add a

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,760
data source

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,040
across the ones provided add in the

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,519
credentials

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,519
and add it to the cluster they can be

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,319
mixed and matched across

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,319
different different clusters

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,400
one of the other things we heard from

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,640
users is that they wanted to use presto

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,480
as a cloud data warehouse and so with

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,959
the hana cloud we've really simplified

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,959
it

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,959
uh with every cluster you get a

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,080
pre-integrated hive mera store that's

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,400
managed for you

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080
you have an s3 bucket that is

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,120
pre-integrated as well

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,000
um and and in addition to that there is

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,120
an apache superset as a bi sandbox that

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,480
you could use

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,840
to uh to query

00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:01,360
your clusters and and that's

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,920
deployed all deployed within your vpc

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,080
one of the other really helpful features

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,280
is the query logging capability

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,879
we saw that every user needed this and

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,560
they were rolling out their own

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,239
and so what we did is we added the query

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,840
logging capability

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,280
where you can you have the query log

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,320
pre-attached to your clusters

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,840
to each each and every cluster so let's

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,120
take a look and what that looks like

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,199
so when you connect to a cluster

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
you see that we have the the ahana

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,680
managed hive meta store that's

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
pre-attached and we also have the query

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,840
log

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,840
that you could use

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,440
so here you see that it has a query log

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,960
table

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,520
that's pre-attached within within the

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,000
rds

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,000
database

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,560
we can go ahead and select

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,080
some data from it you'll see that there

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,400
are some that are run by

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,840
superset some queries some some that are

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
run by me

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,520
so there you have it a hana cloud is

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,080
easy to set up and manage presto

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,440
you can zero to presto in 30 minutes

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,680
including

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,280
setting up compute plane in your own

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,440
account cloud account

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,680
it comes fully integrated and gives you

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,400
an open cloud data warehouse

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
with a pre-built catalog that's managed

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,400
for you

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,000
a built-in integration with s3 as well

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
as a bi sandbox

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,759
and lastly it's cloud native it runs on

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,680
amazon eks

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,360
for high scalability availability and

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,759
manageability

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
thank you very much to learn more do

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,280
visit hana dot io

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,840
