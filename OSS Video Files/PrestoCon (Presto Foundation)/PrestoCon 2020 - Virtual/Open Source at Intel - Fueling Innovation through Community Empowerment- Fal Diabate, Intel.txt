hello welcome to presto khan

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,319
thanks for attending this session my

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,400
name is falje

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,080
and i'll cover intel commitment to open

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,759
source saying that the work we're doing

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,040
together to make it pervasive

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,560
in all kinds of industries

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,640
question for you what do all this

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,520
company have in common

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,199
you write open source software if your

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,160
answer was intel you've been equally

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,000
right

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,320
though intel worked very closely with

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,480
all of this company and many more

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,160
but the common denominator among all of

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,520
them is open source

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,920
as they use it as the engine

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,399
of innovation so how does intel

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,040
participate into this whole movement

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,039
well

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,440
as a manufacturer of electronic devices

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,239
that

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,280
empower the world's computing storage

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,640
and networking

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,160
solution out there um our contribution

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,359
will naturally start at

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,399
the lowest level of the stack and so we

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,800
work on

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,159
the you know the lowest levels such as

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,200
the kernel

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,600
drivers and and firmwares

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,880
uh we collaborate very closely with

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,159
industry standard

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,880
such as the the

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
linux foundation to ensure that we have

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,040
less fragmentation

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
we work very closely with commercial

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,479
companies and

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,840
customers to ensure that

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,280
those solutions are robust and uh

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,920
enterprise ready and we collaborate with

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,320
academia to ensure that the

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,759
next level of uh the next generation of

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,759
development right

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,079
are very worse in using open source

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,520
software

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,119
another way of talking about our

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,320
contribution is

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,439
to say that all the code that we provide

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,040
in open source

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,880
get upstream into

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,520
the different projects out there this is

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,719
just a sample of some of those projects

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,840
and the upstream code get

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,000
consumed and utilized by

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,440
many companies out there that you see on

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the right hand side

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,520
we use to develop a product of to solve

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,080
business problems

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,599
some of those companies at the uh

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,599
enterprise level will create

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,000
we create a software to solidify the

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,400
infrastructure

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,360
others will use it to build the robust

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,440
databases and one of those companies

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,640
just to pick on one of them is

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,640
hana which develop commercial products

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,879
are based on presto db

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,160
ana is at the conference today i

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,480
encourage you to

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,280
go visit them and you may learn anything

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,640
or two

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,879
about the solution so go visit their

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,879
their booth and also the the keynote

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,080
and as you can see intel commitment to

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,840
uh open source is real we've been doing

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,640
this for many years it's not a fashion

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
for us

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,879
it is something to say to provide

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
choices to customers

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,080
the latest kernel itself and many would

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,120
say

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,760
is the starting point of this large

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,040
movement that is all over today

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,080
was built on intel architecture in 1991

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,560
linus as a student of saari what became

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,200
the

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,239
the learner's colonel he invited pretty

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,680
much everybody

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,799
in uh in the industry to contribute to

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,840
the code

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,080
intel took that to heart we became today

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,159
number one and number two contributor to

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,879
the kernel

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,560
fast forward to today you have a mini

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,040
project we're involved in but i wanted

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
to

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,920
single out one one specifically and

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,120
that's the uh the one

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,400
api project that intel is sponsoring and

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,840
pushing out there

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,439
and this is a unified programming uh

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,439
cross a multiple architecture

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,280
project which is industry-based with

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,840
open to everybody

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,680
allow developers and architects to

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,799
develop their code

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,680
uh on multiple architecture and get near

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,599
native performance on each of them so

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
whether you're developing on cpu

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,759
or you're developing for gpu or

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,320
accelerator or fpga

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,680
this project is there for you call to

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,840
action to you is this

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,280
let's continue to work together and

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,800
collaborate to make

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,759
open source permissive again

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,560
and to provide more choices to customers

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,360
please

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,600
visit xero1.org and software.intel.com

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,600
to learn more about what intel is doing

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,919
specifically in the industry

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,919
and what we're doing together to make uh

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,320
open source a reality again for for

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,960
everybody and to keep that

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,560
engine or innovation alive thank you

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,479
very much for listening

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,479
