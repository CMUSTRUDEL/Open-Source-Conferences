	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
i'm founder and ceo of starburst i only

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,160
have five minutes so i'm going to talk

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,080
fast but i'm going to talk about the top

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,960
five presto features that created mass

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,280
adoption

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
and before i dive in i want to clear up

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,400
some confusion

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,679
in the community we are not the candy

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
company i know that's going to

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,400
disappoint many of you but

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,520
that is the truth we are of course uh

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,080
the presto company

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,680
uh again i introduced myself uh these

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,800
are some of my co-founders

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,000
uh we came to presto back in 2014 after

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,320
the acquisition of that first

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
business that eric referred to uh we

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,480
were looking to

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
figure out ways that we could help

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,200
teradata catapults into

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,079
uh the 21st century here of of big data

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,000
analytics and

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,760
we were excited when we met martine dane

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,559
and david the uh the creators

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,960
of presto along with eric clang as well

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,239
uh

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,280
and ultimately we that began a

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,960
collaboration from 2014 to 2017 we

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
contributed heavily to the

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,039
presto code base and then ultimately

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,559
created starburst in 2017.

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,640
today we've grown very quickly over the

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,239
last three years we have well over 100

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,000
customers we've raised 64 million in

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,799
venture capital and we're growing

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,560
very quickly and we're super excited to

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
announce that earlier this week eric

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
wang actually joined the team as well so

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
bringing the entire

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,759
group of presto creators now uh under

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,000
one roof i know the team is

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,360
excited to have him back he took a brief

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,600
hiatus to work on the

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,600
facebook portal product but is now back

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,439
to uh back to presto

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,040
so the top five features that created

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,040
mass adoption number one

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,320
the connector-based architecture of

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,159
course this was inherent from the

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,960
beginning but the basic idea was to

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,280
create

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,600
a shared architectural decision and

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,920
implementation that allows customers to

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
uh connect to any data source that they

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,520
choose and

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,960
this idea was what made it fundamentally

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,640
different there were many sequel on

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,960
hadoop engines at the time

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,200
and of course presto is sql on anything

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,200
and that is what makes it special so

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,360
thank you to of course the the creators

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,840
for building that idea into the product

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,840
uh from day one number two the

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,360
cost-based optimizer this was another

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,640
major leap forward

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,920
in uh 2018 i believe this was added to

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,319
uh to presto

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,679
which now allows for much more efficient

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,560
joint optimization this

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,160
improved performance by 10x or more

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,440
particularly for complex

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,760
joins and was a major addition uh to

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,360
the presto project some of the folks

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,760
that worked on that are carol

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
ookash craters and pyotr uh some

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
colleagues of mine from the facebook

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,080
team

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
sorry from the teradata team who later

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,680
joined uh starburst

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,599
number three is support for s3 and other

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,840
cloud storage this is critical because

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,360
s3 and s3 compatible storage is the new

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,920
data lake i think we all

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,280
recognize that at this point that in a

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,120
post hadoop world

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,440
the data lake concept remains and that

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,400
is critically important using open

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,080
data formats like orc and parquet but

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,959
now moving them to cloud

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,959
object storage or in some cases new s3

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,040
compatible on-prem object storage like

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,720
mineo my good friends at minia

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,319
david was the main driver of this

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,319
innovation number four

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,440
is parquet which i just alluded to

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,840
zhengzhao

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,080
played a major role in creating this uh

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,239
um capability within presto

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,400
in the early days uh presto only

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,840
supported orc and that was because that

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,720
was what facebook used

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,680
uh and needed but of course many people

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,080
use parquet

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,840
and xinjiao worked on this while he was

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,760
at uber and now at twitter

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,879
this is a major innovation for the

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,440
project as well

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,280
number five correlated sub query support

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
this is critical to allowing

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
the ecosystem those sql tools to work

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,040
you need to have complete ansi sql

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,159
compatibility in order to do that

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,840
for example bi tools like tableau looker

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,879
um this is a critical uh addition that

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,239
griggers worked on many years ago in the

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
foundational days of

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,760
presto and number six extended support

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,360
for types bar car

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,519
car and decimal it's hard to believe

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,200
that presto didn't have these types

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,280
but facebook didn't need them in the

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,040
early days and this was something that

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,000
all of our customers really needed as

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
you can imagine

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,159
and so dane wukash carroll and andre

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,879
rosa who still had facebook

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,360
but was a colleague of mine at teradata

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,760
uh

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,280
built this feature together and it is so

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,280
important that the community work

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
together on creating these features

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,639
that's how these things get built

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,079
because it allows you to have all the

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,440
inputs of all the different potential

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,400
users and in this case this was

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,079
something very

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,479
important to sort of fortune 500

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,199
customers who needed these capabilities

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,000
lastly for sitting through all of that

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
with me i have

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
