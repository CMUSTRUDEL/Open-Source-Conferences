	Optimizing Query Performance by Decoupling Presto and Hive Data Warehouse - Gene Pang & Calvin Jia, Alluxio, Inc.

Speakers: Calvin Jia, Gene Pang

Presto is commonly used to query existing Hive data warehouses. Due to existing applications, tech debt, or previous operational challenges, Presto may not be able to achieve its full potential but bound and limited by past decisions. Challenges include overloaded Hive Metastore, unoptimized data layouts such as too many small files, or lack of influence over existing Hive applications.

Ideally, Presto would access data independently from how the data was originally managed. Alluxio, as a data orchestration layer provides the physical data independence for Presto to interact with the data more efficiently. In addition to caching, Alluxio provides a catalog service to abstract the table metadata, and transformations to expose compute-optimized data. In this talk, Gene describes the challenges of using Presto with Hive, and discusses how Alluxio data orchestration can solve them.
