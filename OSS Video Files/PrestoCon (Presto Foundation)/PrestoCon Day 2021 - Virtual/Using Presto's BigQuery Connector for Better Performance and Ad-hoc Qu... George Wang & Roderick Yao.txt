Description: 
	Using Presto's BigQuery Connector for Better Performance and Ad-hoc Query in the Cloud - George Wang, Ahana Cloud & Roderick Yao, Google

The Google BigQuery connector gives users the ability to query tables in the BigQuery service, Google Cloud's fully managed data warehouse. In this presentation, we'll discuss the BigQuery Connector plugin for Presto which uses the BigQuery Storage API to stream data in parallel, allowing users to query from BigQuery tables via gPRC to achieve a better read performance. We'll also discuss how the connector enables interactive ad-hoc query to join data across distributed systems for data lake analytics.
