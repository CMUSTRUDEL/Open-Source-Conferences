	Disaggregated Coordinator - Swapnil Tailor, Facebook

In the existing Presto architecture, single coordinator has become a bottleneck in a number of ways for cluster scalability. 
   - With an increasing number of workers, the coordinator has the potential of slow down due to a high number of tasks.
   - In high QPS use cases, we have found workers can become starved of splits by excessive CPU being spend on task updates in coordinator.
    - Also with single coordinator, we have an upper limit on the worker pool because of above-mentioned reasons. 
To overcome with this challenges, we are coming up with a new architecture which supports multiple coordinators in a single cluster.
