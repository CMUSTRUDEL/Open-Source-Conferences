	Top 10 Reasons to Use & Contribute to Presto - Steven Mih, Ahana

Presto is complicated with many intricacies. Ahana Cloud is the only managed service for Presto on AWS that simplifies Presto, bringing its power to platform teams of any size or skill set. In this session weâ€™ll give you a quick overview of Ahana Cloud, including managing multiple Presto clusters seamlessly, querying a range of data sources, as well as just-released capabilities. 

For more info about Presto, the open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes, see: https://prestodb.io/

hey thanks everyone uh great to be here

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,839
my name's steven me i'm the co-founder

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,880
and ceo of ahana ahana

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,280
is the company that provides a

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
first and only managed service for

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,960
presto db

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,400
focused on presto db a little background

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,240
on the company is that

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,320
uh we've been part of the presto

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,039
foundation and we work with

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,039
folks that are deploying presto in the

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,279
cloud and we make that very very simple

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,439
and very easy to do

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,320
we have contributions to the project

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,040
such as

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,000
the apache ranger which we provide into

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,879
the open source

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,920
and a number of other uh contributions

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,160
that we make

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,120
for my five-minute presentation we got

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,120
questions about

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
why should we use presto and contribute

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,920
to presto and so i thought just to

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,840
lighten it up

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,520
we'll make it a little bit uh the the

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,600
top 10 list

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
david leverman style i guess i should

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,320
have my cards

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,000
but let's go through it so first of all

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,480
some background in case you missed it is

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
that

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,520
presto db is the repo of the original

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,600
project

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,119
that's hosted by linux foundation

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,080
espresso foundation

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,600
and the creators had a hard fork which

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,040
ended up splitting the community we

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,040
hoped it would all unify

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,159
but that was now renamed trino in the

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,799
last couple months

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,360
and uh there they control that as part

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,759
of

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,119
being co-founders of a commercial vendor

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,479
and so these are two different very

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,560
different projects because

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,920
there's now less confusion of the naming

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,119
i thought it'd be important to share

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,479
some of the different

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,360
differences that you may want to be

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,680
aware of as it relates to

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,560
what are differences about the how the

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,320
project is run

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,600
and what are the technical differences

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,079
so let's go through it

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,079
uh number 10 presto is hosted on the

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,280
linux foundation uh trino

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,240
is not part of the linux foundation or

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,920
apache software foundation um they are

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
part of a foundation that is

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
owned by the co-founders of a commercial

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,040
vendor

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,200
number nine presto has a neutrally

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,840
governed uh a project with uh

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,439
stated principle uh that there's no one

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,640
individual or company that can control

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,280
the project so

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
we kind of call this a community driven

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,879
project

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,160
which everyone can participate in and be

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,120
part of

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,720
and governed as such and there isn't a

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480
charter like this or a principle like

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,040
this that we're aware of

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,520
number eight the governing board of

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
presto has board members from 10

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
different companies

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,920
10 different companies and that number

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,239
is growing all the time

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,200
recently intel joined and we're really

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,360
excited about that that provides some

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,239
really good governance and oversight of

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
the project

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,080
for such principles like and making sure

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,920
you know one company has control over

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
the project itself

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,760
number seven uh the presto technical

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,239
steering committee that

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,800
is one of the committees underneath the

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,360
uh

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,480
presta foundation it's similar to the

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
asf

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,519
pmc if some of you are familiar with

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,400
that

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,840
they have developers that are a myriad

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
of developers that work at five

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,000
different companies

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,920
and most recently aws has has a

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
member on the technical steering

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,120
committee and congrats on native us

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,159
for their contributions to that and

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,360
number six presto's developed tested and

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,360
runs at scale

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,120
at facebook uber and twitter these are

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,319
the largest clusters out there

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,080
in the world of four data analytics

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,519
and we think that's really really

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,440
important the scale

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,440
as well as all the reliability and the

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,599
further development that they're making

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,200
into the project and that's just not the

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,120
case trino doesn't run

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,560
at facebook uber and twitter and from

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,680
the developers we talk with

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
that matters quite a bit number five uh

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,959
presto today

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,000
uh uses six less uh six times less

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
memory and

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
repartitions two times faster with

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,040
project arya

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
i think you've heard from from tim's

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,120
talk uh on the tsc

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,319
that uh project aria is something that

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,720
is is is a really fantastic innovation

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,360
and trino doesn't include that number

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,439
four

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
preston spark is another project that

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,400
runs uh massive batch etl jobs

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,840
and uh that's uh another great talk

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,120
that's happening today

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
uh that's not in in in trina and number

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,360
three

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,040
presto today is ten times faster with

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,799
project raptor x that was

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,759
james's fantastic talk that just

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,199
happened caching at multiple levels

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,759
and number two tomorrow presto will have

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,520
more

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,320
coordinators making it more reliable and

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,000
more scalable whereas uh trino is

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,919
working on the single coordinator model

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,639
which is a single point of failure

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,199
number one presto tomorrow we'll have a

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,759
native

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,759
uh c-plus bus worker and uh we think

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,840
that's a fantastic uh uh

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,919
direction for the project and you'll

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,919
hear more about that later today

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,520
so this is the reason why we really

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,520
believe in the presto project

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,120
we think you should too and we hope that

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,600
you'll join the presto project moving

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,040
forward

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,120
thanks so much for your time today

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
really appreciate it again hana cloud

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,440
you can check it out

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,360
in 30 minutes you have your cluster

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,360
