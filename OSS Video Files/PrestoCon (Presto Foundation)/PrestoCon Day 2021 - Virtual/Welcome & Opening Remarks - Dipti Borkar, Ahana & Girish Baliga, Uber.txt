thank you dj kara this was fun early in

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,440
the morning i mean this

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,000
really really challenged me i was

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,760
wondering like you know this is 7 am

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,679
um you know i'm in seattle as you can

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,639
see i'm presenting at the comfort of

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,039
my bedroom turned into like a virtual

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,039
office for the last one year

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,240
can't believe and i trust you know

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,720
everyone else is

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,560
doing well in this very strange times

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,640
that we have been dealing with

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,599
also been a year since we wanted to meet

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,320
in person

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,840
that was our original con that was

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,160
scheduled for march

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,360
i believe right around this time 24th or

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,440
26th

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,200
and you know here we are a year later

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,040
but i'm really glad you know that you

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,879
know these virtual platforms have given

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,480
us an opportunity to connect with you

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,239
and stay in touch with you know all our

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,320
community members

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,600
um in ways that we had not even thought

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,399
before um

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,760
so you know i hope uh with starting with

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,879
saying that you know i hope everyone is

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,120
doing well

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,079
and you know we'll be kicking off our

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,000
presto khan day

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,440
event in a couple of minutes i see

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
grisha deeply have both

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,720
joined and i would like to really

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
welcome

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,159
you both again early morning uh you know

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,200
to come

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,080
and share your thoughts about um what's

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,119
happening in the space

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,119
of presto uh deepti has been the chair

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,640
of the outreach committee for the

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,520
question it's been a pleasure working

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
with her for

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,759
over a year organizing these events and

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,320
staying connected with the community

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,040
and girish has been doing an amazing job

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,119
uh you know

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,640
man as the chair of the foundation and

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,280
again it's been a pleasure working with

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,840
you

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,680
kirish as well so since i sit on both

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,200
these committees you know i get to see

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,119
and work with them very often it's a

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,640
pleasure um

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,479
you know it's it's interesting i was

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,280
asking them about um

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,399
you know some fun facts to share and

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,799
both of them love

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,439
traveling uh in fact make it three of us

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,200
um

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,360
and again i can't imagine you know how

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,000
difficult it would have been because you

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,960
know that's

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
one thing we just can't do right now uh

00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,840
but virtually

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
let's hope by changing our backgrounds

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,520
and you know going to different places

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,640
we can vicariously

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,520
uh kind of enjoy uh the travel and

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,360
yesterday i was

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,640
i had another event i was presenting at

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
and somebody asked me

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,640
is that a surfboard behind you and no

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,920
it's actually not a surfboard it's a

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,840
green screen who's

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,959
you can see the top broke off so i don't

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,480
have it behind me

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,080
so you'll have to deal with a little bit

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,160
of my messy space

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,480
here today to like you know get that all

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,800
fixed and reconnected

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,280
uh so before we start uh you know just a

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,560
quick note also you know thanks to our

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,360
sponsors uh intel starburst hana

upsolver

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,720
and uber for helping us you know make

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,959
this event

from an idea into a reality get to talk

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
to all of you

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,519
and also a few housekeeping items before

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,720
i hand over the mic to

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,400
grisham deepti um on your left

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,239
which is where i'm pointing to hopefully

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
yeah there should be a session tab if

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,720
you are running into any issue you click

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,680
on that

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,200
and there is a help desk uh you can just

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,000
click on that and there are folks who

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,400
can help you out pretty quickly

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,760
so anything you can see the schedule uh

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,760
how the talks are happening what the

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,400
next session is you can go in and go out

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920

any of us and we'll take care of that

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,760
pretty promptly

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,720
something new that has been also added

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,200
this time

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,120
uh we do have uh the new trans uh text

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
translation feature now available in the

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,840
hop-in platform

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,159
and i i saw rachel had just put

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,879
a link in the session chat so you know

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,720
if you feel

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,560
you know you need uh some kind of

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,560
translation live translation

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,120
um you know feel free to click that and

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
use that i believe it also does um

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,040
captioning so you know you can even get

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,799
it converted to english and just kind of

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,680
watch the captions going along

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,319
so uh without taking any more time uh

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,879
girish

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,200
and deepti pretty much over to you and

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,599
i'll be around most of the day hopping

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,239
in and out of the hop and platform um

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,400
and

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,160
you know be in touch with all of you

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,959
thank you and welcome once again to

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,959
presto con day

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,919
thanks thanks a lot for that uh really

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,720
nice introduction amit

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,759
and uh welcome everyone to our

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
prosthetic one day

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,440
we have a very exciting lineup of talks

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,160
events

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,759
and as you just heard an amazing dj

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,800
who's gonna keep us on schedule

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,919
throughout the day

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,240
um so before we get started uh

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,240
into our amazing talks i just wanted to

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,120
give a quick overview of

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,759
uh the presto this is probably new to

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,720
some of you

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,680
so i just wanted to share some thoughts

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,120
about

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,960
the journey of presto where we are today

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,639
and give an overview of the presto

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,400
community the foundation and how you can

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,880
participate

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,120
hello everyone welcome to presta con day

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,600
and we're very excited to be here

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,160
um uh we have a great day planned for

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,199
everyone

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,240
and looking forward to it all right

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,919
go ahead girish awesome uh so

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,720
um here is a a trajectory that

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,960
typical open source projects uh see over

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,840
the course of their life

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,160
we can roughly uh put their trajectory

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,800
in

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,759
four phases so the first phase is

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
usually when

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,000
a need is identified right so there is

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,919
basically

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,199
uh a set of current technologies that

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,720
you use to solve

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
one set of problems and then you have a

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,320
new set of problems and you need arises

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,160
and then you have to figure out some

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,639
workarounds with your current

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,840
technologies which is when people start

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,840
working on some new

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,199
technologies to solve those specific

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,120
problems

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,199
and then next phase is when there is

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,240
some widespread adoption because the new

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,840
technology is better

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,720
it's easier to use it and so there is a

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,639
positive feedback loop there around

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,080
development and adoption

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,880
and then in the next phase uh it becomes

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,440
more and more

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,199
uh adopted widely and now you run into

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,639
the familiar problems of performance

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,639
scale reliability

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,240
and you start deploying these in mission

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,199
critical use cases

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,240
and then finally uh in phase three uh

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,120
there is mass

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,160
uh uh platform adoption this is where

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,919
like uh

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
the platform is typically adopted with

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,280
lots of companies and you see an

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,360
emergence of a complete solution

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,880
um so tracing this kind of a journey

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,319
with presto

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,600
um we had so next slide pc

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,919
yeah so around roughly 2012 2013

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,840
um the technology of the day was uh

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,160
batch systems like hive

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,759
right so these are systems where you

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
could take a massive amount of data do

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,599
some processing

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,360
and then get some results but these are

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,880
bad systems one stage at the time

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,960
so what this means is that your jobs

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,319
will take a long time uh to go

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,560
end-to-end so these are great if you

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,280
wanted to do lots of number crunching

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,800
but the new set of use cases were around

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,080
internet or analytics where people

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,039
really wanted the results

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,039
uh coming up quickly uh which is where

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,880
engines like presto came along right so

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,720
these brought a new paradigm which is

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,960
basically uh streaming

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,639
so you have multiple stages running in a

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,720
pipeline mode at once

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
and the queries can run and execute very

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,000
fast so that that was the innovational

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,599
pressure so you could run these smaller

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,479
queries very fast

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,160
so then in phase one we had uh

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,000
grassroots adoption because

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,000
a lot of people saw that presto was very

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,599
easy to use and then there was a huge

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,160
amount of feature development there

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,800
and people started latching onto presto

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,400
and then we

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,560
pretty quickly got into stage two where

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,599
companies like facebook uber twitter and

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,400
so forth started adopting presto

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,360
putting out huge deployments and we saw

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,960
users

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,720
adoption in the hundreds to even

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,639
thousands now

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,879
and so over the last couple of years we

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,840
basically said that it is

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,280
actually at a point where we can uh

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,319
build a huge community around it and

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,360
that's what we've been doing for the

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
past two years

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,840
so as of this point presto is pretty

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,280
much a mainstream

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,280
platform and it's picking up being

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,960
picked up as an engine of choice in most

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,080
companies

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,199
so we can uh also map this to uh

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,520
what your journey of adopting presto as

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,599
an

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,879
user either individually or within your

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,120
company can be

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
so in phase zero you'll probably

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,800
download presto on your

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,560
laptop you'll try it out you'll connect

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,599
it to your local data store or maybe

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,680
your hive store

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,240
this should be fairly easy we have very

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,880
good documentation on how to do this

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,640
and then in the next phase you could

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,160
deploy presto in

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,160
either your on-prem or your cloud

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,920
setting you could connect it up you

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,040
could set up the configurations

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,880
and then you will start getting some

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,320
initial value as you onboard a few

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,640
initial use cases right

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,519
and then pretty soon we expected to be

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,000
very popular

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,959
word of mouth uh people seeing a much

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,120
better tool

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,800
and then uh you'll start having to knee

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,839
uh deploy this in a mission critical

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,040
level so this is where you'll have to

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,760
build a team

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,480
and now it probably ends up becoming too

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,160
popular

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
at this point and you have to start

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,320
thinking of how you can

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,920
use presto for pretty much all use cases

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,560
so we we hope that you'll see

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,800
that trajectory and hopefully some of

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,040
the talks today and the panels will

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,200
share some ideas and perspectives on how

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,640
you can take the journey through your

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,760
organization so uh

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,320
the presto foundation is our

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,120
is the home of the presto community we

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,040
have a

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,160
non-profit structure hosted under the

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,800
linux foundation

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,440
our mission is to enable and support uh

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,839
broad

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,279
re-platforming for data platform teams

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,880
with picking presto as the engine of

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,920
choice for analytics

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,440
so to support this mission uh we have a

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,920
fairly standard structure under the

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,640
linux foundation we have a governing

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,240
board

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,360
which governs the entire community so

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,600
the governing board is largely

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,000
responsible for things like uh

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
making sure that the foundation is set

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,240
up correctly the structure is good

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,800
uh all uh the technical work is going

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,399
well

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,320
the outreach work is going well but it

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,760
is largely in a supervisitive role

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,680
right you can think of it as the board

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,959
of directors for a company

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,720
as part of the governing board we have

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,839
an outreach committee which is currently

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,800
headed by deepti

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,120
uh so they are responsible for things

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,959
like

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,240
uh organizing the customer qualifiers

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,399
meetups outreach membership

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,399
and all these activities then we have

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,040
the technical steering committee which

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,880
is uh

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,519
the equivalent of let's say the apache

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,279
pmc so this is where the

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,720
technical contributors to the presto

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,600
project meet

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
on a regular basis so these meetings are

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,160
open to public

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,399
you don't have to be a member of the tac

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,880
to participate these are available on

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,440
our

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
presto community website so you can go

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,880
attend it

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,160
the minutes are available you can put

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,440
items on the agenda

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,880
you can talk about whatever you want um

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
and this is where this is usually

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,240
presided over by the committers

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,839
and this is a great place to get

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,360
involved at a technical level

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,880
and then finally we have the end user

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,680
community uh

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,000
so we have slack channels email groups

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,399
and

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,399
a whole list of other forums where you

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,279
can engage with the presto community at

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,920
large

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,800
work with the contributors committers

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,399
and the other

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,720
companies and stakeholders involved in

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,399
the community so at a high level this is

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:34,399
the way the structure is uh set up

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,600
so uh the presta foundation is uh

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,440
operating on three guiding principles so

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,680
the first and most important is that we

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
are an open neutral and united presto

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,320
community

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,920
so what this means is anyone is

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,519
invited and welcome to participate in

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,839
all our meetings uh

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,240
discussions so we don't have any

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,480
roadblocks anyone is free to come in

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,600
please bring your ideas your use cases

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,040
we are happy to

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,600
take you in and our missions

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,440
we also have an open transparent

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,639
technical leadership and direction

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,760
so all our technical

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,959
and uh governing structures are based on

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,079
standard linux

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,079
policies and principles so everyone is

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,600
invited to participate we have standard

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,320
ways of

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,760
picking committers picking people on the

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,440
board and so forth so

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,839
all these things are very open and

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,880
transparent and we invite everyone to

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,519
participate

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,880
and finally no individual company or

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,639
company is greater than the project or

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,360
orange community so we expect everyone

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,800
to come in and participate as an equal

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,720
we would love to hear your thoughts but

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,399
you should also be open and willing to

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,000
engage equally with other people so

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,680
these are the three governing principles

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,880
of our foundation

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,720
um and lastly i wanted to quickly cover

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,120
this new program that we are

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,279
exploring this year so this is the

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,360
presto conformance program

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:06,079
um so this is a program where we want to

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,600
set out a way for our community to

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,040
figure out whether they are using

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,320
a either a presto deployment

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,519
or a presto related product uh that

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,560
conforms to

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,079
what we think is the standard presto or

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,399
the compliant cluster at this point

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,959
in time right so why are we doing this

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,959
now the project is moving pretty fast

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,399
there are lots of presto db releases

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,639
lots of new vendors

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,120
cloud support for presto and so forth

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,519
and there has been an increasing need

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,040
from developers and users to find an

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,639
easy way to figure out

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,800
if the version of the presto they're

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,440
using or of a supporting product they're

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,399
using

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,000
in in the presto ecosystem um conforms

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,320
with presto

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,560
so the conformance will primarily be

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,160
around things like feature compatibility

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,240
api compatibility connector

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,480
compatibility so

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,160
your deployments if if it's confirmed

00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,040
with this you can have some guarantees

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,360
that will work in

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,959
uh the current uh presto deployment or

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,160
version that you're using

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,360
um so uh the key uh bottom line with

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,199
this program is we want

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,880
you to be confident uh knowing that you

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,880
are basically using a

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,079
version that's very close to what we are

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,680
running at scale at

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,199
big companies like facebook uber and

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,519
twitter

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,720
uh so to give you an example of a

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,800
conformance program

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,680
um so the next slide

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,639
yeah so the kubernetes uh for foundation

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,920
under linux

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,760
the cnc foundation has a very standard

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,920
conformance program where you have this

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,519
badge for certified with kubernetes

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,199
uh and that gives you some guarantees

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,639
about the

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,240
products that you're using and how well

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,000
they would interact with kubernetes

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,240
so we're using this as a template so

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,600
hopefully you'll hear more about this uh

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,600
later in the year

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,440
uh so with that i'll hand off to dp for

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,639
uh commentary related updates

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,880
great thank you girish um uh yeah we're

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,240

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,880
uh for presto

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,480
um it's um a lot of things have been

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,160
resolved a lot of confusion has been

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,880
resolved earlier in this year

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,399
and we are forging ahead with uh with

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,399
presto and welcome everyone to

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,760
participate in the community we've

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,959
we've seen a continuous uh growth

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,920
in all our channels uh slacks social

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,680

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,920
uh and um and it's um we look forward

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,959
uh to the year in engaging with users

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,760
contributors

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,440
over time committers um and get to that

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,440
strategic value that uh

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,880
that girish was talking about welcome

again to presto khan day

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,399
um we were thinking back on as amit was

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,279
saying earlier

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,880
exactly uh six months ago we had presto

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,839
khan which was the first and

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,800
uh biggest presto event uh in fact fun

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,440
fact is

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,720
it was originally planned for this day

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,920
march 24th

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,360

with presta conde

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,399
a new program that we've started uh

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,880
we'll have uh

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,240
hopefully a lot more presto con days uh

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,399
globally over time

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,000
through various regions you know six

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,240
months ago when we started off

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,600
with prestokon and um i've been involved

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,880
with the foundation

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,320
from really the early days we had

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,720
six members and it's it's been

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,320
a great journey to see it really growing

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,000
into an industry consortium

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,759
today we have 10 members and that's

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,560
growing uh

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,440
happy to have the new members join in

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,759
participate

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,560
you'll hear from many of them today and

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,320
um

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,600
and we hope that one day this becomes

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,399
like a cncf

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,519
with hundreds of members and and we see

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,480
that

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,079
that that journey for presto over the

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,399
next 10 years

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,000
uh various programs are part of the

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,560
outreach committee we do

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,920
uh the pressocon days we have many other

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,759
events

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,120
one that i'd like to particularly call

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,920
out is our meetups

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,000
we have had really great success uh

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,680
thanks to our speakers and and

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,759
contributors and end users

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,120
who want to tell their stories about how

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,319
they use presto

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,760
what they're contributing back to presto

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,039
and our home bay area meetup uh has

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,240
crossed uh a thousand members um

you for your support

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,160
we hope to grow this into 10 000 over

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,640
the next

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,240
next few years we are also starting

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,360
global programs and so

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,640
um already we have a new york

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,960
bangalore sydney london meetup and those

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,760
are

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,760
those will grow over time and i'm

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,720
excited to see this as well as other

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,520
other programs come out of the outreach

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,720
committee

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,200
uh we're here for you as a community and

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,240
let us know uh what uh what you'd like

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,919
to hear

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,600
one of the things that uh girish was

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,559
talking about is this presto journey

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,679
right um

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,440
we we think we are um uh at

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,760
phase three now with massive

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,360
re-platforming across data platform

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,960
teams and we encourage you to

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,000
participate in the foundation join the

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,280
foundation

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,160
but a big part of of this movement

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,760
is the adoption of use cases what we're

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,720
seeing from users as well as

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,480
the community is uh while presto started

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,720
off with interactive querying

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,960
the list of use cases has expanded over

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,039
time as more and more capabilities

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,799
have come on board and and have been

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,840
added to the core

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,400
project especially over the last two

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,160
years

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,679
uh and the last year alone you'll hear

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,160
from uh from uh

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,120
tim in a bit in just a little bit about

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,840
some of these uh

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,039
great great new capabilities um i wanna

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,200
take you through the day

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,240
and tell you about uh what uh what to

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,880
look forward to

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,480
um for each of these use cases as you

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,799
see interactive query

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,919
come across in your uh in your

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,840
organization

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,360
uh as a platform team as a platform

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,360
engineer and you're looking at

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,640
supporting your data analysts and your

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,559
data scientists

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,760
interactive quitting is becomes

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,200
incredibly important

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,679
it's one of the core use cases for

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,240
presto and i'm really looking forward to

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,760
the raptor accession today uh with 10x

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,080
faster presto

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,960
with with caching pretty much across

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,600
every layer

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,640
of the engine another one is reporting

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,960
and dashboarding

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,400
we have end users presenting as well

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,480
carbon will be talking a little bit

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,360
about how they run real-time customer

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,440
dashboards

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,039
not just internal ones but actually

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,320
customer facing ones and

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,600
um this is a uh what to watch as well

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,520
now many of you know presto is a

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,559
federated engine it connects with many

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,600
many different

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,720
data sources databases data lakes um

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,320
and streaming engines and more and

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,520
there are a few key um announcements and

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,600
new features that we're

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,919
announcing today at presto conde the

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,440
first one is presto and apache iceberg

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,559
this has been a big request from from

um looking forward to this getting

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,760
integrated in we have bigquery uh

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,600
connector that's preserved that uh

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,320
roderick from google and george will

talk about uh and then in in addition to

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,640
that we're seeing streaming engines like

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,440
uh

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,200
real-time engines like pino apache pino

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,640
work really well with presto

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,880
we have a a session on that as well um

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,880
on the data lake house analytics this is

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,240
another emerging area

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,559
where we're seeing a lot more

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,440
collaboration uh with the other

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,559
communities

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,000
um we'll we'll have a panel uh on some

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,960
of this but

presto at uber

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,080
is one that uh you might be interested

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,320
if you are thinking about

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,600
building a lake house vision in your um

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,080
in your enterprise

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,039
and then finally uh last but not the

presto today and there's many more that

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,760
are considering

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,720
um their next query engine and um

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,840
there's two key sessions today one is uh

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,360
presto has historically had a single

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,440
coordinator and we have a session today

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,760
about a multiple coordinator support

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
uh from swapnil at facebook uh look

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,720

and then another one around presto

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,320
gateway service across clusters many

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,360
many clusters

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,039
of presto deployed uh at uber so

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,960
it's gonna be a great day thank you

very excited about

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,159
the program today as well as as future

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,000
programs

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,520
uh and then the last few things uh we

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,440
have two panels um

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,559
i'll be moderating these looking forward

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,440
to um phenomenal a discussion with uh
