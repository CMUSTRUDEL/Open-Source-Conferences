	Realtime Analytics with Presto and Apache Pinot - Xiang Fu, Stealth Startup

In this world, most analytics products either focus on ad-hoc analytics, which requires query flexibility without guaranteed latency, or low latency analytics with limited query capability.

In this talk, we will explore how to get the best of both worlds using Apache Pinot and Presto:
1. How people do analytics today to trade-off Latency and Flexibility: Comparison over analytics on raw data vs pre-join/pre-cube dataset.
2. Introduce Apache Pinot as a column store for fast real-time data analytics and Presto Pinot Connector to cover the entire landscape.
3. Deep dive into Presto Pinot Connector to see how the connector does predicate and aggregation push down.
4. Benchmark results for Presto Pinot connector.
