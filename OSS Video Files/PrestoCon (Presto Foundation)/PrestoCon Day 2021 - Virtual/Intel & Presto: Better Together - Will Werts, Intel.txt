everyone my name is will wurtz and i'm

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,960
here on behalf of intel

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,040
we are very excited to be at our second

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,280
presto event we attended the initial

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,360
presto con but we're here back again for

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,360
more with presto con day

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,119
we think this is really important way

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
for us to communicate and connect with

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,320
the community

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,240
which is why we're we're back and we're

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,800
we're here to pick up the conversation

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,080
where my fellow colleague faulty abadi

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
left off after he

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,080
espoused intel's uh prevalence in the

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,599
open source community

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,120
and now we're we're here to talk a

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,800
little bit more about that as well as

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,440
the end rules that we've made with

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,440
presto itself and our key partner hana

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,280
open source again has been critical to

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,160
intel strategy dating back to even

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,360
the 1990s with the original linux

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,000
optimizations

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,480
and kind of elevating it to the point

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,079
where it

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,879
has become such an important operating

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,199
system today and really a key foundation

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,600
for which open source software is is

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,039
able to run and be enabled

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,199
there's many different facets here

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,320
whether that's our investment in the end

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,080
customers

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,360
whether that's creating new key

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,479
technologies to

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
to make developers lives easier and to

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,560
enable

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,880
more enterprise software at scale

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,680
it's been a long journey but we're very

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,080
happy

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,680
that we've been able to be a part of it

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,799
there's really two parts to this journey

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,960
the first part is

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,600
the the upstream development and

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,920
bringing the software to fruition

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,520
and we we've kind of invested in many

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,759
different parts of this

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,799
and had a very open conversation and

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,040
discourse

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,079
with key developers and solution

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,920
architects

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,880
to make sure that our software stack

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
our hardware portfolio and a lot of our

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,840
adjacent products

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
really meet their needs rather than do

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,079
it the other way around

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,880
we want the feedback we want that

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,600
integration as a deep hardware software

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,960
integration

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,439
is really the best way to ensure the

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,960
the best tco and performance out of all

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,200
these different solutions

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,640
and kind of on the downstream side this

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,080
is where we actually see

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,239
much of this work and this technical

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
enablement come to fruition

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,840
where we're able to leverage it with our

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,000
respective partners

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,959
and make sure that they feel resourced

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
by intel

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,959
and that we're able to support them in

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,120
their endeavors whether it's finding

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,160
new customers or changing the world

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
through important

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,800
technology in the cloud

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,319
intel has been very interested in presto

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
through our partnership with the hana

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,239
who they have their managed

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,400
sas model for presto as well as their

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,959
commercial support on aws

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,000
we've kind of honed in on some key

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,599
instances

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,280
that we think are are really important

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,959
that's the r5 forex the large and the

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,800
r52 extra large

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,800
for making the coordinator and presto

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,239
workers when spinning up that managed

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
cluster

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,000
this is on our intel cascade like

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,640
technology which really is going to give

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,400
a great

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,239
balance of price for tco perspective as

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,280
well as a performance perspective

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,800
making it kind of a key uh uh key

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,720
instance when you're making that end

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,280
hardware decision

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,120
we think that this is very important

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,120
that we continue to analyze this

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
and so we have existing engagements

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,239
right now where

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
we're taking uh some of their customers

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,720
we're working with them and we're

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
finding

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,640
uh kind of a how-to guide and providing

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,200
some key data that's

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,920
going to be released very soon to make

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,959
sure that

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,920
when when you're going to to spin up on

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,760
on the cloud you get the best possible

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,959
intel hardware in architecture

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,959
uh as the foundation

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
on premise this is something we're also

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,879
very interested in we've had

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
meetings with key members of the presto

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,040
community

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,360
as well as the some key intel architects

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,200
and engineers to make sure that we're

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,200
able to kind of tailor

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,439
our approach to presto to best meet

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,640
their needs to make sure that our

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,879
hardware stack

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,959
is adequate and is able to make sure

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,080
that they're able to use presto

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,680
affordably and at a high level and one

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
technology we think is really important

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,519
this is to

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,480
obtain persistent memory this is a

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,519
very affordable comparative technology

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,880
to dram

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,280
that we think is going to continue to

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,960
revolutionize the way that that we move

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,120
transform and analyze data at scale

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,440
we want to make sure that latency is

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,880
minimized and performance is maximized

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,720
and this is a great way to do it so

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,199
we're actively

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,639
internally uh evaluating ways that we

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,800
can we can give back

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,080
to the presto community and make sure

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
that some key

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,560
existing users are able to get more and

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,199
make push their workflows to the next

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,240
level

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,160
as well as future users are as well we

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,360
thank you very much for listening to the

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,560
intel session today

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
if there's any feedback that you can

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
give to intel for what we can do to help

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,800
you

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,840
don't hesitate to reach out thank you
