	Drag and Drop Query Builder for PrestoDB - Ravishankar Nair, PassionBytes

You use multiple tools for databases, for example Azure Data Studio for SQLServer access, Toad or SQLDeveloper for Oracle access, MySQLWorkbench for MySQL databases. Imagine we have one tool and we can query any database, bring any table from any catalog to a single canvas! Now you join, the underlying PrestoDB compatible query is generated. Click a button, you get the profiled data, including distributions and correlations. An amazing tool in action. 

For more info about Presto, the open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes, see: https://prestodb.io/
