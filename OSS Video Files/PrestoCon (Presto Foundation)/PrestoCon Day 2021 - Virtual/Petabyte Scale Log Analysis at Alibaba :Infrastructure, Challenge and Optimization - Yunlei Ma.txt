Description: 
	Petabyte Scale Log Analysis at Alibaba :Infrastructure, Challenge and Optimization - Yunlei Ma, Alibaba Cloud

1.Yunlei will share the infrastructure for petabytes scale log data collection, storage and analysis at Alibaba . Presto plays a key role in the infrastructure. Presto processes over hundreds of billions of query, about over 1 quadrillion rows every day .
2.Due to the heavy work Presto faced with, there are a few challenges about performance, stability and availability. To deal with the performance issues, Yunlei developed several layers of cache, including data source cache, intermediate cache, result cache. Due to the huge amount of query, coordinator became the bottle neck, Yunlei modified coordinator to a distributed architecture, so coordinator can be expanded horizontally. Yunlei also developed a feature that pushdown predicate to storage layer in order to use inverted index. Some other optimizations will also be included in the slide. 

For more info about Presto, the open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes, see: https://prestodb.io/
