	Presto and Apache Iceberg - Chunxu Tang, Twitter

Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets. At Twitter, engineers are working on the Presto-Iceberg connector, aiming to bring high-performance data analytics on Iceberg to the Presto ecosystem. Here, Chunxu would like to share what they have learned during the development, hoping to shed light on the future work of interactive queries.
