	Presto on AWS using Ahana Cloud at Cartona - Omar Mohamed, Cartona

Cartona is one of the fastest growing B2B e-commerce marketplaces in Egypt that connects retailers with suppliers, wholesalers, and production companies. We needed to federate across multiple data sources, including transactional databases like Postgres and AWS S3 data lake. In this session, we’ll talk about how Presto allows us to join across all of these data sources without having to copy or ingest data - it’s all done in place.
In addition, we’ll talk about how we were up and running in less than an hour with the Ahana Cloud managed service. It gives us the power of Presto and the ease of use without the need to manage it or have deep skills to deploy and operate it.
