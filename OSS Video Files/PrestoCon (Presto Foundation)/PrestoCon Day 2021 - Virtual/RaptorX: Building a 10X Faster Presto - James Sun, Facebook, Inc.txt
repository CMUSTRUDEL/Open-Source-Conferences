	RaptorX: Building a 10X Faster Presto - James Sun, Facebook, Inc

RaptorX is an internal project name aiming to boost query latency significantly beyond what vanilla Presto is capable of. For this session, we introduce the hierarchical cache work including Alluxio data cache, fragment result cache, etc. Cache is the key building block for RaptorX. With the support of the cache, we are able to boost query performance by 10X. This new architecture can beat performance oriented connectors like Raptor with the added benefit of continuing to work with disaggregated storage.
