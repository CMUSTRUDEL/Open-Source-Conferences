At Twitter, engineers maintain several large Presto clusters with over 2000 nodes in total. A Presto router service, sitting between clients and Presto clusters, employs a round-robin algorithm to redirect queries. Twitter's engineers observed that CPU and memory usages on these clusters were not balanced and the performance of the overall Presto system was impacted.

Here, Chunxu and Beinan would like to share what they have learned in developing a highly-scalable query predictor service through applying machine learning algorithms to ~10 million historical Presto queries to classify queries based on their CPU times and peak memory bytes. At Twitter, this service is helping to improve the performance of Presto clusters and provide expected execution statistics on Business Intelligence dashboards.
