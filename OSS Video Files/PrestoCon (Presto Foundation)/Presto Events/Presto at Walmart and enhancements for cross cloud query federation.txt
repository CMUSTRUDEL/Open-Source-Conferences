Publication date: 2020-11-17
Playlist: Presto Events
Description: 
	This session talks about challenges associated with querying diverse data sources at Walmart. It will cover implementation of critical components for Enterprise acceleration offering such as security integration for fine grained access control, caching, auto-scaling & auto deployment in GCP.

In this talk we are going to introduce Presto cross environment query federation which will enable query execution across different clouds and on-prem Presto clusters. This helps in reducing the network data transfer which results in lower Egress and Ingress costs when we are querying across clouds.
