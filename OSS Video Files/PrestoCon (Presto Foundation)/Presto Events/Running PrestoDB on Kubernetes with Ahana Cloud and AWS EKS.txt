- Introduction to the Amazon EKS service
- Why use the in-VPC deployment model with AWS
- Deploying PrestoDB on AWS EKS using the Ahana Cloud managed service within the userâ€™s AWS account
- Demo of how PrestoDB can easily federate across different cloud data sources like MySQL, PostgreSQL, S3 and other with a few clicks
- Using AWS Glue as a catalog for Presto to map S3 data lakes
