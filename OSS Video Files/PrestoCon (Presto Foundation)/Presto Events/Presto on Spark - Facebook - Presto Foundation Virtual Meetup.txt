	Andrii and Wenlei, Presto Team at Facebook

At Facebook, we have spent the past several years in independently building and scaling both Presto and Spark to Facebook scale batch workloads. It is now increasingly evident that there is significant value in coupling Presto's state-of-art low-latency evaluation with Spark's robust and fault tolerant execution engine. In this talk, we'll take a deep dive in Presto and Spark architecture with a focus on key differentiators (e.g., disaggregated shuffle) that are required to further scale Presto
