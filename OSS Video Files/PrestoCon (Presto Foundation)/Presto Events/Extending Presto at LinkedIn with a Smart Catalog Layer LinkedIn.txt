	Walaa Eldin Moustafa, Staff Software Engineer at LinkedIn

In this talk, Walaa describes how LinkedIn extended its Presto Hive Catalog with a smart logical abstraction layer that is capable of reasoning about logical views with UDFs by using two core components, Coral and Transport UDFs. Coral is a view virtualization library, powered by Apache Calcite, that represents views using their logical query plans. Walaa shows how LinkedIn leverages Coral abstractions to decouple view expression language from the execution engine, and hence execute non-Presto-SQL views inside Presto, and achieve on-the-fly query rewrite for data governance and query optimization. Moreover, he describes Transport UDFs, a framework for defining user-defined functions once, and automatically translating them to native UDF versions of multiple engines such as Presto, Spark, Hive, or data formats such as Avro. Both Coral and Transport UDFs are open-source projects. Learn more about them at https://github.com/linkedin/coral and https://github.com/linkedin/transport.
