ladies and gentlemen hello and welcome

00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,490
to a very special event yours truly Eric

00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:15,130
Cavanaugh is here for a virtual round

00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,590
table discussion building the Presto

00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,390
open-source community folks we have an

00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:21,970
all-star cast lined up for you today

00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:25,510
we'll be hearing from Girish Baliga of

00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:28,420
uber Amit Chopra from Facebook of course

00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,949
Dipti bolcar from Ahana and you dong

00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,770
from Alibaba

00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,809
these folks are deep inside the matrix

00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,910
of the open source community folks very

00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:38,829
very excited to be learning about what

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,540
their take is on what's happening in the

00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:43,210
marketplace and of course what presto is

00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,100
all about so just a very quick opening

00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,170
statement from yours truly here I've

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,350
tracked the open source movement quite

00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,550
religiously frankly since 2005 when I

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,290
was doing research at the data

00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,090
warehousing Institute and I was

00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,670
fascinated by what the Apache foundation

00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,309
had done so back then

00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,530
the Apache web server was the number one

00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:04,719
web server in the world in terms of

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,759
websites being hosted and I thought to

00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:10,390
myself this is really fascinating stuff

00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:11,680
and at the time again this is 2005 I was

00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,290
thinking to myself you know the

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,060
combination of SOA as an architectural

00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:19,180
approach service-oriented architecture

00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,790
and open source software really spells

00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,220
trouble for the old fashioned closed

00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,650
source view of the world and I thought

00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,119
to myself this is this is a big deal

00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,340
this is really going to fundamentally

00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,799
reshape out enterprise software is

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,290
design delivered developed even

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,990
maintained over time this is not some

00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,240
small evolutionary change this is a

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,000
fundamental revolution in how software

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,650
gets deployed and it took a little bit

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,479
longer than I thought frankly but we've

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,520
gone through various iterations lots of

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,619
open-source projects and for those who

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,659
aren't familiar open-source projects are

00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:54,880
typically run by committers so you have

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,009
folks who commit their time and a lot of

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,049
times you get competitors working on the

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,790
same project which at first can seem

00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:02,409
kind of strange but it actually works

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,540
out very well because there's a bigger

00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,030
cause there's a bigger purpose in mind

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,659
well presto is a fascinating project

00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:13,150
that has come out since 2012 and came

00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:14,980
out of Facebook and then they open

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,510
sourced it and now there's a presto

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,960
foundation we'll talk about that on the

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,600
call too

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,250
day but if you think about it my history

00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,290
and this business goes way back to the

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,940
early days of data warehousing when was

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,920
all about extract transform and load

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,720
building your warehouse building your

00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,060
schemas build building your models

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,370
really understanding what the users were

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,170
going to want to do with it and the idea

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,300
back then was we realized you couldn't

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,060
query operational systems an ERP system

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,070
was not designed to run analytics it's

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,690
designed to run your business and we

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,780
figured out that we really had to pull

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,400
data from these core systems put it into

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,680
a relational data model in a data

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,660
warehouse and then allow analysis of

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,940
that data on top of the data warehouse

00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,310
so you build your old lab cubes online

00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,960
analytical processing to get faster

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,240
query times you'd optimize the

00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,370
architecture optimized the schema etc

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,770
but the point is the data warehouse was

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,620
the centralized marshalling area for

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,840
data well a funny thing happened on the

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,120
way to the future of this industry and

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,710
that was big data and big data came

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,700
along and really threw a wrench in the

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,110
works and frankly that's why you saw

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,600
technologies like Cassandra come out of

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,430
Facebook because the big companies out

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,280
of Silicon Valley realized they could

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,900
not use off-the-shelf database products

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,880
to do their jobs that just couldn't

00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,200
happen so they had to roll their own and

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,280
so we entered this whole new era of of

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,830
application development and of these

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,380
data foundations right so this concept

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:44,590
of a data Lake came around in the Big

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,450
Data evolution and now what you see is

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,030
you will have companies that have a data

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,880
warehouse or two or five they'll have a

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,290
data Lake or two or three of lots of

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,570
different information systems that

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,580
they're looking to leverage and to use

00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,080
but it no longer makes sense you can't

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,730
pull all of your data into a warehouse

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,290
you can't even realistically pull up

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,300
your data into a data Lake and then

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,950
expect good performance so what's been

00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,830
happening is press though is this

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,480
federated query engine that allows you

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,400
to access all these different

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,440
information sources where they are and

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,570
get that truly strategic view of what's

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,820
going on in your business so this is a

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,130
really big deal it's very exciting stuff

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,330
I'm very bullish on the future of open

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,010
source there have been a couple of

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,080
hiccups along the way those in the

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,090
industry know about some infighting that

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,040
we saw a few years ago and I think that

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,460
is subsided and faded now we're all back

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,500
on this

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,210
Paige but so there are going to be

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,430
hiccups along the way for sure going

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,410
forward but the bottom line is that open

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,150
source is here to stay it has in fact

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,460
fundamentally changed how enterprise

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,780
software gets designed and deployed with

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,000
that let's go around the room and get

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,949
some introductions from folks so first a

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,169
Girish from uber tell us a bit about

00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:54,069
yourself and your take on the open

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,479
source movement and presto hi Eric

00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,729
thanks a lot for that wonderful

00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,849
introduction of open source and of

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:03,220
presto so I'm an engineering manager at

00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:06,220
uber I'm part of the data infrastructure

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,349
team personally responsible for presto

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:12,910
and pino so interactive and real-time

00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:15,310
analytics so at uber presto is very

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,460
widely used as you mentioned it powers

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,470
analytics on our data Lake and by last

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,030
count I think about half the company

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,500
logs into pressed or at least once a

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,840
month to do something that's important

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,050
for their work so clearly this is a big

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,479
deal for our team big deal for uber and

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,639
seeing this community thrive is

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,440
personally important to me as well ok

00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,150
good and I'm moving around the room Amit

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,120
Chopra from Facebook tell us a bit about

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,759
yourself and your commitment to open

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,940
source and presto yeah absolutely

00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,430
hello everyone my name is Ahmet I'm part

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,280
of the Facebook open source team work as

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,620
a developer advocate and the role of my

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,479
team is to basically go evangelize open

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,180
source we all believe in that very very

00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,219
strongly I've been in the company for

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,409
about nine months which is pretty much

00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:04,360
the same as when we started the Presto

00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:06,849
foundation I in fact join in just a

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,320
couple of weeks before the foundation

00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:10,659
was being launched and have been

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,479
involved fairly intimately from day one

00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:16,180
in starting the foundation getting it

00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:18,070
off the ground our focus is really on

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,250
building the open source community so

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:23,289
I'm really excited to see how presto is

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,030
starting to take shape over the last few

00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:27,610
months getting new members getting new

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,110
people to adopt the product and you know

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,969
fairly excited to you know continue to

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,710
see the product you know evolve when the

00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:34,810
community grow around that and we talk

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,900
about more of that later you know during

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,310
the chat ok good and the dipti book are

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,380
from Ohana it's also a bit about

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,460
yourself and your commitment to presto

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,620
yeah thanks Eric for having

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,319
of us here and great introduction little

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,509
back of a history a lesson going back

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,180
all the way to open source and and data

00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:56,110
are data warehousing I'm the co-founder

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,060
and chief product officer at Ahana and

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,220
in addition to that I'm a part of the

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,819
pesto foundation like a bath and Girish

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:07,729
and the chairwoman of the the Outreach

00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:12,800
Committee and as I got introduced to

00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:15,550
presto I would say late 2000 2018 and

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,349
was very much immersed in the community

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,080
building products that were created with

00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:23,000
presto meeting the community presenting

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,300
and meetups events and through the

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,940
journey I kind of realized that the

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,860
analytical stack has changed like you

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:35,320
know what similar to what you were

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:38,300
talking about and data Federation which

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:41,060
is something that that has existed for a

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,150
while is coming back with a bang and it

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,580
is almost certain that there's a

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,530
different architecture that's needed in

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,919
this new in this new world that we have

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,560
post big data at cloud and that's kind

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,180
of how I got it to do into presto

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,150
I've been a part of the open-source

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,940
community for over ten years with my

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:04,669
prior companies like Couchbase analog Co

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,130
very very much believe in open source

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:10,400
and my co-founder and friend Stephen and

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:14,389
I he came to the same conclusion that's

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,130
how kind of Ahana began that's great

00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,830
stuff and I think you're exactly right

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,139
about the federated aspect of the world

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,300
we're going into right now and you dawn

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,280
last but certainly not least of Alibaba

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,060
so excited to have Alibaba on the call

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,550
today folks

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,680
what an amazing organization I have to

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,539
say I have heard that you folks are

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,579
doing fantastic things with artificial

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,829
intelligence of course so is Hoover and

00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:38,450
Facebook I don't want to give it any

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:40,490
false impression there but you don't

00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,839
cause a bit about yourself and what you

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,570
see happening and your commitment to

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,670
presto okay thank you Eric for the great

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,579
introduction yes this is a video from

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,699
Alibaba Group I assume a know Ari bada

00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:56,150
is the lot is the cloud service provider

00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:59,090
in China and in Asian market and

00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:01,850
so from the very beginning of the

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,370
Alibaba cloud we do embrace and

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:07,040
contribute back to the open-source

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:10,040
community to build up our a lot of our

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,360
services on cloud for example databases

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:19,880
and the big data analytics all those

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:24,110
services on cloud so as to presto we we

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:27,410
actually leverage the presto to several

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:30,550
of our key product on the on the cloud

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:33,560
for example our data like analytics

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,350
provider service of Federation analytics

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,140
I assume no actually I already just

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:42,800
mentioned it so we move them actually

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:46,220
we're in we were in the Big Data time

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,990
right but now we think we are moving to

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,770
the fast data era

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:54,770
so which requires a lot of more effort

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:57,710
to do analytics to different data

00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:02,390
sources in the real time minor so our

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:06,589
team actually in our Ababa cloud we have

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:09,380
a database business group and in our one

00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:11,630
of our tasks is to provide such a

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,770
real-time service and it is a service to

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:18,680
our customers and cloud yep yeah I think

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,930
that's a really good segue you as we

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,940
dive into what presto is all about

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,100
because I think you're right fast data

00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,470
is going to be a hallmark of success

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,570
going forward but so is analytics safe

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,430
to get right down to brass tacks

00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,780
analytics drives the information economy

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,780
I don't think there's any doubt about

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,730
that and in fact going forward in the

00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,100
cloud-based world which is the new

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,950
center of gravity analytics needs to be

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,020
real-time and it needs to be baked into

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,570
these systems so it's not just sort of

00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,400
an offline process that happens when an

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,790
analyst reviews a dashboard or something

00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,950
like that

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,290
we will increasingly see artificial

00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,240
intelligence and traditional analytics

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,459
actually woven into the fabric of

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,320
operational systems and that's a really

00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,810
really big deal so let's kind of go

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,610
around the room and get some thoughts on

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,500
presto as an overview what you see

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,190
happening why it's so important and real

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,830
quick folks the Presto foundation think

00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,900
like the Linux Foundation for example or

00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,640
the cloud native computing foundation

00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,760
these are all organizations with the

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,960
same type of mission they're trying to

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,840
generate awareness they're trying to

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,240
create forums for discussion about these

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,040
technologies and to really foster

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,140
collaboration I think that's the the

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,150
foundational key right is to foster

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,880
collaboration because these are very

00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,650
complex technologies and one person

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,110
cannot figure them all out quite frankly

00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,210
and as I suggested before that whole

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,950
paradigm of closed source programming

00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,290
it's still around it's not gonna go away

00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,030
it's still gonna be a part of the the

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,250
magic if you will for certain companies

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,380
but the foundation it seems to me is

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,030
going to remain open source and so let's

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,580
go around the room and talk about presto

00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,440
itself how it's used what you think

00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,750
about it what are your insights etc so

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,400
first Girish of uber tell us your

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,670
thoughts about why presto is so

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,250
important in the world today I'm citing

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:09,370
this diagram that you have up there Eric

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,380
does a wonderful job of putting in a

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,310
nutshell why presto is important and

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:17,910
what value it adds so as you can see it

00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:20,200
abstracts away the user interface that

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,360
analysts and data scientists use to

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,770
understand the data using tools like

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,030
super cell Jupiter tableau and a bunch

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:31,030
actually at uber we have half of these

00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:34,450
tools available and used very heavily by

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,150
our users and that set of interfaces is

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,580
cleanly abstracted away by presto from

00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,500
where the data is actually stored and at

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,630
the bottom again you have a bunch of

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,520
systems up there and I can probably

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,670
recognize at least half of them also at

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,110
uber but presto is the thing that ties

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:54,250
these two things together right so

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:57,700
presto gives a single point of contact

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,620
for our users using these front-end

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,110
interfaces to query data on all these

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,850
systems but even more important than a

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,520
single point of contact I think is a

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:09,070
single abstraction layer and by that

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,830
what I mean is that you can query data

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:14,170
on all these data sources using a single

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,660
query language which is presto sequel

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,000
and a single view of the data which is

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,960
basically set of definitions within

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,410
presto where you can take data

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,810
let's say Hadoop HDFS and people and

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,550
join them as if they were sitting in a

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,870
single database right and presto makes

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,140
this all possible through the

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:40,660
abstraction layers that it builds so the

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:43,810
really powerful power of this system

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,150
comes out with in in some use cases that

00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:49,480
we have at uber so for instance we have

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:53,410
Pino as a real-time analytics tool and

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,840
we have Hadoop as a big data layer where

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,730
we store our historical data and through

00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,150
for instance a patch a super set we are

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,760
able to build a single dashboard which

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,250
allows our users to look at how the

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,290
real-time business is doing as well as

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,090
what the historical trends are in a

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,660
single place using a single interface

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,790
all powered by presto - presto sequel so

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,560
I think this highlights the incredible

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,170
power that proced was able to bring to

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,120
the data analytics space and that's why

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,490
I think I'm very excited about Crestor

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,150
the system and a community that has made

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,610
this possible

00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,680
because I have seen other kind of open

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,590
source and closed source systems and I

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,840
really don't see this kind of

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,670
functionality available to this extent

00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,370
and I think this is largely because the

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,260
power of the presto community and I'm

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,810
very excited to be part of this and part

00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,210
of it yeah those are those are excellent

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,700
points and I'm glad you mentioned this

00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,770
again power of Federation of being able

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,600
to reach across different environments

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,360
into different information sources and

00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,000
pull together that particular view of

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,980
some aspect of your business as if it

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,680
were in a single table somewhere in a

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,420
database write it to the user it who

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,790
cares where it came from as long as you

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,580
get the right information and I think

00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:11,830
increasingly we're going to need to to

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,500
reach into many different systems in

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,360
order to see what's actually happening

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,450
especially in this in this cloud-based

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,460
universe of ours and so Amit Chopra I'll

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,740
bring you into this as well could you

00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,510
talk about why you feel pressed there

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,310
was such an important aspect and why the

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:30,790
Presto foundation is important for

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:33,340
really furthering the Presto DB engine

00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:37,279
and for really taking the next steps and

00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,529
and it and evolve in this industry yeah

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,180
so I'll build on you know what giving

00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:42,970
just talked about you know from an

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,160
architecture perspective

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,750
presto was design phase you from the

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,910
very early stages to have the whole

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,860
notion of pluggable backends which makes

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,540
it now really really easy to get

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,480
different kind of connectors that get

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,430
added when Facebook started the project

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,920
as you actually mentioned you know that

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,899
companies had such unique large data

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,760
needs that nothing commercial

00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:07,449
out-of-the-box would work so they ended

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,800
up designing some of these systems and

00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:12,110
from the culture of what I've seen here

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,940
at Facebook they encourage a lot of work

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,709
to be done in collaboration with the

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,600
community so making this as an

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:20,149
open-source project from the very early

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,920
stages was very important part of you

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:23,779
know ensuring that it's not just us

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,760
who's working on this we have other

00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:29,839
people looking at the designs

00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,370
contributing to us for the growth of the

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,510
system as well and that's where we have

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,490
a lot of partners that we work with last

00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,699
year as you mentioned you know we picked

00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,410
off the foundation we're also trying to

00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:44,769
see who are some of the partners who

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:47,089
have made contributions to the product

00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:50,000
companies like uber for example with the

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:52,010
pallino connector can we work in a more

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,260
open collaborative environment under a

00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:56,449
very neutral open governance which is

00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,660
what many companies care about this

00:16:56,449 --> 00:17:01,220
shouldn't be a one-man one-person show

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,890
and the foundation gives us that

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,689
platform to open it up beyond just

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,880
saying hey this is just Facebook doing

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:09,949
this thing it's more collaborative we

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,540
have so much more engineering talent

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:14,089
that can now start looking at this

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,730
collaborate together in an open neutral

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,160
space and help you know accelerate the

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,949
growth of the engine so that's what you

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,530
know I'm really excited about okay good

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,209
and Dipti pork are from Ahana

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,580
tell us a bit about yourself and I love

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:31,280
the name Ohana by the way I learned

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,650
trying to call it you guys last week

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,059
what that what that means where that

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,470
came from can you share that because I

00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,030
think it's very very interesting it's

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,900
from Sanskrit right tell us all right

00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:45,490
it's what that means yes yes absolutely

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:49,070
yeah comes from it's a Sanskrit word

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,630
Sanskrit is a very old ancient kind of

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,720
Indian language a lot of structures

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:57,980
written in it and for me I'm kind of a

00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:01,070
database geek at heart so when I look at

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,559
data Federation and kind of the the

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,710
image that I I got in my mind as we were

00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:09,020
founding the company was you know an

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,510
energy the center of it like Girish

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,890
talked about there's a you know presto

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,650
cluster in the middle it's kind of the

00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:18,260
lingua franca is sequel and there's

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,870
power energy emanating from that to many

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,780
different data sources pulling data and

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:26,659
energy back in and the world Ohana means

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,820
first rays of the Sun and it's pretty

00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:32,120
incredible to actually have a word for

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:38,360
that and kind of the background of

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:41,240
bhajana it for me looking at history

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,370
which kind of rhymes it may not repeat

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,039
but it certainly rhymes and we're

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:49,100
looking at the third generation of data

00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,659
Federation with presto just looking at

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,780
this architecture you can you get a

00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:57,710
sense of how much the analytical stack

00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:01,400
has as a vault right it used to be three

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:04,490
three databases back in the day it over

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,799
time we added you know column stores and

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,409
maybe a few more databases and today

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,230
even this probably doesn't do justice to

00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:17,270
everything that's out there and because

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:19,190
of that it's important to rethink what

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,130
architecture makes sense in this world

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:25,580
in this new world because you know as

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:28,340
I've talked to users data engineers who

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,650
are in the big data space when they

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,559
share about their experiences they spend

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,450
a lot of time building pipelines to copy

00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:37,510
data from one source to another making

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,549
it accessible from one source to another

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,860
whether it's from their operational

00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:46,220
system to s3 or a data warehouse

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,880
etcetera 60% of their time is spent in

00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,220
moving data around right and what presto

00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,059
does is it beautifully solve this

00:19:52,220 --> 00:20:00,470
problem by being able to query in place

00:19:55,059 --> 00:20:03,679
and pushing some of the core query logic

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,950
if you will we call it push downs to the

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,720
data

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:10,730
sources pull that data in memory and and

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,740
process it and return it back to the

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,340
analyst or the technical product manager

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:19,010
or the data-driven person at the other

00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,039
end trying to make a decision right and

00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:25,700
so that's that's kind of the Mike resto

00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:28,610
is why now and and how its relevant

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,760
today it's very different from the

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:34,480
previous previous years and you know 20

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,059
30 years ago and and that's why it's

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,010
it's so important in this new in this

00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:42,500
new world in this new stock in place

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:44,299
querying and the ability to fade rate

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,460
across many data sources and to be able

00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:50,779
to join across them which is a very hard

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:52,639
problem to do it solves it very well and

00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm glad you mentioned that to dipti

00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:57,860
because not only is it good to take

00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,139
advantage of these new technologies for

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,850
accessing data where it lives because

00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:04,130
you don't have to move it so much and

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,110
let's face it the movement of large

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,630
amounts of data is very painful even

00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,980
though we're getting better at that -

00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,750
ideally if you can you want to leave the

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,460
data where it lives and access to where

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,590
it lives and that's what presto allows

00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,029
you to do and also I'd just like you to

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,340
click the comment what we're really

00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:21,440
seeing here is the confluence of many

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,029
different technological innovations from

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,820
across the spectrum of the open source

00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:27,980
community right so being able to

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,559
leverage the latest advancements allows

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,750
us to deliver this kind of solution

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,779
where you really can in a very timely

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,970
fashion reach across five seven ten

00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:39,919
different environments and extract and

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,139
pull back the key little bits that are

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,690
necessary having used this push down

00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:46,250
technique that you talked about right

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,909
yeah yeah absolutely i mean i think that

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:51,799
presto has come has done a great job

00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:55,580
compared with the previous iterations

00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:57,260
right there there was a hive which was

00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,240
one of the approaches that was used to

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:03,830
query data there was there's other

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:06,110
technologies but because presto was be

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,240
is based on anti sequel right anti

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,409
sequel is very very widely used and

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,630
that's one of the reasons it's also

00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:14,899
become so popular it's because you don't

00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,370
have to relearn or reintegrate existing

00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:17,779
products that are out there right it's

00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,419
if they already come

00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:24,320
Stano JDBC ODBC drivers and it just

00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:28,159
works out of out of the box and and and

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,440
so in terms of the the architecture if

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,830
you you get access to all these data

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:37,009
sources and and it's processed in memory

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:39,979
as opposed to some of some previous

00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:42,109
generation technologies that were more

00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:44,359
disk based right talking about real time

00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:46,879
and fast data that's the other aspect

00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:50,479
that's important which is it's an

00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:53,570
in-memory system with the ability to to

00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:56,419
spill to disk etc for larger data sets

00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:59,179
and and the speed is important and so

00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:01,909
whether it's human whether its kind of

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:04,179
internal use cases like an uber its

00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:06,259
Facebook it might be kind of more

00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:08,809
internal use cases where internal

00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,489
employees are using it there are users

00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:12,799
and customers that I've talked to where

00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:15,139
they actually have built products end

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,979
customer products on top of presto and

00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:21,529
we're s Ellie's and you know Layton sees

00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:23,599
become even more important and so that's

00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:25,820
that's those are some of the advantages

00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,429
that prestoh has in comparison with the

00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,049
with the other systems and and kind of

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:34,399
has led to the popularity and the

00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:35,809
adoption of it as well ok good and you

00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:38,089
dong from Alibaba

00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:40,309
tell us a bit about why you feel presto

00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:42,919
is so important and why it's a big part

00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:46,429
of what you're doing over there yes I

00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,080
think both Eurasia me and the depth II

00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:50,529
already talked about that the data

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:54,409
Federation right so based on our

00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:57,759
experience like that from both alibaba's

00:23:54,409 --> 00:24:00,769
in internal business like e-commerce and

00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:03,379
at what husband and the local service we

00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:05,599
use a lot of analytics and those are

00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:09,309
analytics business I rely on the

00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:12,950
different type of it sauce they can have

00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:15,619
transactional data log data and the

00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:19,700
streaming data a lot of data and besides

00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:22,159
those conventionally structured data we

00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,379
also need to precise a lot of

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,339
unstructured data for example the image

00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:31,179
data and even the audio or other

00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:35,019
multimedia and structure data

00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:40,659
the Presto provide this capability and

00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:42,549
for us to to enable our analytic system

00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:45,489
and to precise the both structured and

00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:47,999
unstructured data like a Jason and an

00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:51,460
even semi structured they like a JSON

00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:54,759
format right so let that's amazing

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,249
because of conventionally if we like

00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,769
some of our customers they build up

00:24:57,249 --> 00:25:01,749
their own big data analytic system so

00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:05,049
that means that they need to build a

00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:07,739
very complex system to have a different

00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:11,529
kind of components and that complexity

00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:14,950
make yourmake it is really challenging

00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:17,679
for them to maintain and to upgrade and

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,169
it's really hard for them and besides

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,229
the complexity of the big conventional

00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:25,179
big data systems the learning curve the

00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:28,239
learning cost they have to learn the

00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:31,690
different components like a Kafka spark

00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:33,700
and how do all those things right and

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,950
then that they put them together so

00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:39,820
that's really challenging folder for the

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:43,509
business and the Visser presto re bubble

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:47,379
cloud we provide this Oh their need in

00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:48,969
one system so they come from guiding

00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:52,450
that connect to the different data

00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:55,509
sources and then do the this analytic

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:58,299
sound by putting date together and then

00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:02,859
give them what it won't they were like

00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:05,200
the recommendation or other bi or

00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:07,989
reporting so everything can be done on

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,629
this single system so there's a big

00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:12,639
relief for our customers in an even for

00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:17,889
ourselves I think that's the value of

00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:19,210
the presto presto can provide ok good

00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:20,830
want to go ahead and push this next

00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,089
slide just to show the architecture here

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,950
and we have a great question from an

00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:26,169
audience member so I'll throw it out to

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:28,479
each of you just to comment on our first

00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:30,639
two Girish from uber an attendee is

00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:34,509
asking is presto considered data

00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:39,460
virtualization why or why not what do

00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:42,460
you think your ish so I think the answer

00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:44,290
this is obviously yes and no it's not

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:48,160
you're gonna say

00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:51,190
yeah it is not really data

00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,020
virtualization in the sense that you

00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:57,100
don't have things like materialized to

00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:59,770
use although a an excellent exception

00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,970
here is alibaba's analytics DB they're

00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:04,720
there they can trust oh and actually

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:07,450
build a storage system as part of their

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,200
overall offering but presto as you are

00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:13,330
able to get it off of website and run it

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,450
on your system it's primarily a compute

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,730
engine right so you are basically

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:22,120
querying data from storage systems in

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,680
place and as the T was saying all the

00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,680
computation is done in memory for the

00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:31,030
most part and so in that sense the data

00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:32,500
is basically is what you define it in

00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,750
your storage systems but the

00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,610
virtualization comes because presto

00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,280
allows you to define these constructs

00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,690
called views right so if you are from a

00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,490
traditional database background you

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,440
would remember that there are these

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,320
views that you can define and databases

00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:50,470
where you can specify combinations of

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,910
tables in terms of like joins or other

00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:57,490
transforms the user sees a virtual table

00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:59,440
and under the hood the engine is able to

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,810
take your query on this virtual table

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,030
and translate it on the actual physical

00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,980
tables and then do the computations

00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,410
necessary to return the results back so

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,960
in that sense

00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:12,940
presto definitely provides a kind of

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:20,130
abstract virtualization if you will or

00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:21,820
some sort of virtual virtualization yeah

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,100
that's pretty cool

00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,170
ok yeah I'm in Chopra what do you think

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:29,620
about that data virtualization yes no or

00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:31,180
yes and no yeah I think yes I know I

00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,740
think it's the way you would define

00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,810
virtualization I think it what it's

00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,640
really doing this is abstracting

00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:38,980
essentially you know where the data is

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,450
coming from and that makes a huge

00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,130
difference you know if you are a user

00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,690
you shouldn't really have to worry about

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,310
your data source you're running queries

00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,530
in the same way you are running query

00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:50,080
the same query across multiple data

00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:52,480
sources in the same way and if you

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,280
consider that as virtualization then yes

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,470
the answer is yes but it's not a

00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,330
database engine you know it's really a

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,420
powerful query engine

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:03,460
to put perspective there okay good and

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,440
Dipti pork our Ohana what are your

00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:09,820
thoughts state of virtualization yes no

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:17,140
or both yeah agree with both we need to

00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:18,820
disagree on something guys I think it's

00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,790
not ma'am I mean the way that Westar was

00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,800
designed it was designed to sit on top

00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:26,260
of data sources and I'd not be the data

00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,050
source or include a data source now

00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,790
there might be optimizations where some

00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:34,270
offerings might include a data source

00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:36,330
for speed for low latency etc but it's

00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,320
fundamentally it's you know it is a

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,690
query edge and if you look at the

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,170
database stack you strip off the top of

00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:47,140
it which is the parser compiler rewrite

00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,910
optimizer an execution engine and you

00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,860
put it in a separate block right and

00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,650
then you have the data stores there are

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,150
the storage engines which used to be

00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:58,150
part of the database that have been

00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:00,190
separated out and typically data

00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:03,010
virtualization will sit on top of it so

00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,140
I would I would say more no than yes I

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,000
would use Federation more than

00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,870
virtualization because you're reaching

00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,980
out to more sources and pulling pulling

00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:18,250
data in and that's really the purpose of

00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:21,430
presto and how it was kind of initially

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,200
created yeah that's a good point and you

00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,840
Don what are your thoughts thinking of

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,290
virtualization yes no or both yeah it

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,960
really depends yeah so beautiful presto

00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:35,410
ah it does a very beautiful job to

00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:38,370
abstract the interface to connect to the

00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:41,410
data everything is a perfectly defined

00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:43,990
in the connector so the for each

00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:46,900
different type alpha date is also a

00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:49,450
different type of data you can create a

00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,330
easily create a new type of connector to

00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,880
connect to different source of the data

00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,700
sources so that's in that part you can

00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,090
see you can you can take in as what

00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:03,550
relies some kind of virtualization yeah

00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:05,950
okay good so let's move on to talking

00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:07,690
more about the Presto foundation itself

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,670
and I already kind of mentioned this but

00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,880
we do have the Linux Foundation we have

00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,100
the Apache foundation

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,010
there are many many benefits that accrue

00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,030
from these organizations and I even

00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:23,200
found myself referring to this

00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:26,240
technological innovation as foundational

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:29,750
foundation is the basis upon which you

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,850
build and I think one of the best values

00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,070
that comes out of these organizations is

00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:36,080
the governance of course it is the

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:39,260
governance it's also the nurturing it's

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,840
also the sharing of ideas the sharing of

00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,490
thoughts that have concepts you know one

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,890
of the the hallmarks of open-source

00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,500
technology in general is many eyes make

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,990
few the errors write bad code goes away

00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,940
because we can see it all now there is

00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:54,650
something to be said for open source

00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,450
getting up to just a certain point but

00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,790
that's the key is it gets to the point

00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:01,040
where it's useful for everyone and then

00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,780
you can optimize on top of that and I

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,460
think that's really one of the major

00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:09,110
points to make here is that because and

00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:11,450
dipti you mentioned this yourself right

00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:13,670
because it sits on top of these other

00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:16,250
sources it is not itself a data source

00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:18,140
it is not itself a database it is the

00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,730
layer on top that allows you to reach

00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,190
into all these different environments it

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,730
is the layer of abstraction for querying

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:27,440
any number of systems right so back to

00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,930
the foundation let's gotta go around the

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,240
room and talk about the value of the

00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:34,370
Presto foundation it's a vision of where

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,260
it's going and here is what are your

00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:40,970
thoughts so having looked at a lot of

00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,680
different foundation structures

00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,200
particularly in the open source space

00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,780
right one thing that really strikes me

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,600
is there are usually two different

00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,550
dynamics going on in any kind of a

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,430
community where there is open source

00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:58,280
software collaboration right so on the

00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,970
one hand you have a lot of technical

00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,230
discussions technical contributions

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:06,410
people trying to just make the system

00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:08,840
work so a bunch of gathering of

00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:12,020
engineers with you guys right and at the

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,060
same time when you have as foundational

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:17,600
and transformational technology as

00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:20,020
presto at high there are also other

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,160
considerations right so that may be

00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,380
commercial considerations enterprise

00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,560
considerations things of that nature

00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:31,990
and oftentimes if you have a common

00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:34,880
forum where both of these different

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,890
discussions go on in a in the same place

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,310
that leads to all kinds of weird

00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,470
confusion and kind of alternate

00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,510
realities and people talking past each

00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,370
other and so forth so I think Linux

00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,470
Foundation does an excellent job of this

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,440
aggregating these two different

00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,330
discussions right so the way the

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,860
foundation is structured we have a

00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:59,660
governing board where there is a

00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,330
environment conducive for discussing

00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:05,540
about things about the direction of the

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,850
project things about engagement things

00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,669
which are not technically related but

00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,500
probably have an outsize or even a

00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:14,870
majority impact on the direction of the

00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,659
foundation of the project and that's the

00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,550
governing board and there is also of

00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,950
course a technical steering committee

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:25,250
which primarily focuses on the

00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:27,919
engineering aspects and basically the

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,710
discussion there is focused on how to

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,389
make the engine itself solve all the

00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:35,360
problems that are interesting in this

00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:38,710
space rather than trying to also figure

00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:42,730
out other issues such as the community

00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:45,169
the participants and so forth so this

00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:48,050
structure of having governing board and

00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:51,050
technical steering committee I think is

00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,790
a wonderful innovation in the Linux

00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:56,540
Foundation space and this is what really

00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:59,930
attracted at least us from uber to go

00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:02,480
and participate and use this structure

00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,650
for Kristal yeah and just to kind of

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,990
throw this out there folks

00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:09,440
to our audience out there both live and

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,520
in the future at some point think about

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,500
who's on this call

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:16,010
we've got Ober Facebook Ohana and

00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:18,140
Alibaba we have people who are as my

00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:21,230
business partner would say at the coal

00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,630
face of changing how technology is

00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,790
managed and and developed and we are in

00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:28,010
a whole new era with these scalable

00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,050
architectures these scalable platforms

00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:32,270
this is not your grandfather's data

00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:34,340
warehouse to say the very least so

00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:37,859
having the involvement having this

00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:40,410
community of experts collaborating is

00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:42,329
very very powerful it really helps us

00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,859
achieve what the Germans called Gestalt

00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:44,640
where the sum is greater than the whole

00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:46,499
of its parts

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,059
I made Chopra I'll bring you in of

00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:50,400
Facebook to kind of talk about the

00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:53,099
foundation governance and transparency

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,619
it seems to me are the two hallmarks of

00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,239
success we want to Shepard what's

00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,890
happening and we want to know and we

00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,109
want everyone to know what's happening

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,509
what do you think about that yeah and I

00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:05,670
think when Greece mentioned you know

00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:07,890
that one of the key things about how

00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,779
best to foundation operates on the Linux

00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,819
Foundation is the separation of a

00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:14,640
governing board which is responsible for

00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:17,279
overseeing the project at large between

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,839
the direction and the technical steering

00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:21,599
committee which is responsible for

00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:23,910
making sure that the technology moves in

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,559
the right direction a lot of people

00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,869
don't probably even know or realize that

00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,880
you know anybody can actually join and

00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:31,170
you know watch a technical standing

00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,749
committee meeting you know that's the

00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,970
openness and the nature of how things

00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:37,859
are happening now which is significantly

00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,289
different from many other projects and

00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:44,130
how they work so that was one thing I

00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:46,980
definitely found quite useful and making

00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,420
sure that not just you know like-minded

00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,799
contributors like you know uber

00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:53,190
Twitter's been part of the early

00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:55,349
contributors you know part of the pesto

00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,690
foundation as well and you also had

00:36:55,349 --> 00:37:01,799
Alexia who started in the early days

00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:03,809
with us together I think we can work to

00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:06,029
make the product better in a more open

00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:08,099
space and I think that openness and

00:37:06,029 --> 00:37:11,430
being inclusive to companies

00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:14,789
organization is the key thing okay cool

00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:16,710
and dipti porker thoughts from you on

00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:20,009
really the importance on the role of the

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:22,589
foundation itself yeah give us you have

00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:27,029
the hard job of going first so that's so

00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:28,980
good good you you answer most of the the

00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:32,009
question so that's that's very helpful

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,989
for the rest of us in terms of the

00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:36,749
foundation you know it's good to see

00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:38,819
examples right what else has worked and

00:37:36,749 --> 00:37:41,700
what else has been successful Linux

00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:44,460
Foundation has many many foundations

00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:47,460
under it one of the more well-known ones

00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:51,190
is CN CF right with kubernetes and if

00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:54,850
you if you look back you could you

00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:56,500
they could be a vendor kind of driven

00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:59,860
open source a company to have an open

00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:02,680
source approach to a problem or you can

00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,600
have a community driven approach to to

00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,920
an open source project and they're very

00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,010
different they're very different

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,810
approaches as a vendor I mean I'm kind

00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,960
of on the the vendor side I've always

00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,970
been on at the enterprise infrastructure

00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,550
software side of things in in the open

00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:21,790
source space and been on both sides

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:23,470
where it's you know part of a foundation

00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:26,320
as well as part of a company driven

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,430
project and you as the vendor you might

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,490
want to keep everything to yourself

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:32,170
right you want control over it but the

00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:34,000
truth is that when you look at

00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:37,000
kubernetes and you look at projects

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,420
other projects like graph QL facebook as

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,570
well has donated other projects as well

00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:48,340
beyond presto the benefits that you get

00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:50,890
from a broader innovation engine is is

00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:53,700
helpful for everyone not just the users

00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:56,560
but for the vendors who who are

00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:59,320
innovating on top of the core themselves

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,120
right and it's it might be hard to see

00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,240
and you kind of mentioned Eric at the

00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,120
beginning that no it's kind of

00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,410
interesting where you have multiple

00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:11,950
possibly companies that might even be

00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:15,220
competing right the what comes out of

00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:18,070
that is better innovation stronger

00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,170
engines and it's it's not something

00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:22,030
that's the good news it's not new we and

00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:24,850
we're actually just following the

00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:27,640
tried-and-tested path and we've seen

00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:29,980
what success looks like and we think

00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,880
that presto is so foundational that it's

00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:37,000
important to build it and build the the

00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,880
community the right way which is having

00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,160
this transparency and governance

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,870
including getting multiple vendors in in

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,420
fact there should be multiple vendors

00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:48,460
that are supporting the project the

00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,430
suppressed ODB kind of is was the

00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,680
original project and and proud of what

00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,630
the foundation backs and and that's

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,250
that's better for everyone right that's

00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,950
that's that's actually better for

00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:03,220
everyone because think of it I think of

00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,940
the engineering teams right the we have

00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:08,030
some of the best innovators

00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:10,490
in the industry Facebook uber Alibaba

00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:13,010
there they have the best engineers not

00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:15,170
every you know when you have mid mid

00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,720
market companies they can't afford to

00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:21,140
run this this system on their own right

00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,120
they don't have a whatever strength of

00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,090
the team has you know forty fifty people

00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,770
at each of these companies working on

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,830
the skooled distributed system they

00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:33,680
can't afford talent like that and so we

00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:36,290
think of it as all of it together all

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,870
these great minds working on it that can

00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:42,860
then be used by hundreds of thousands

00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:46,070
possibly end users engineers developers

00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:49,310
and that is game-changing right that is

00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:52,700
it is one plus one is really definitely

00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:54,560
not - it's significantly more and I

00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,290
think that's the power behind Linux

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,450
Foundation Presto foundation and

00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:03,430
everyone working together in a in a

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:07,790
transparent neutral you know multiple

00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:10,100
vendor ecosystem all trying to march in

00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:14,660
the same direction and having debate a

00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:17,360
good debate about the roadmap about the

00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:21,320
technology in an open forum so we

00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:24,520
welcome people to join the foundation we

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:27,800
we really want to see it

00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:30,200
please successful and that means adding

00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,620
additional members Amit and I myself we

00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,900
are working very closely on engaging

00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,690
other companies and adding other members

00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:41,660
to the foundation and participating

00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:43,520
through our meetups or events as well as

00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,220
joining the TSE meetings which are

00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,340
public as well as as I might mention and

00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:52,540
there's a significant amount of energy

00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:55,220
and and positivity that comes out of the

00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,870
foundation so hopefully that that adds

00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,600
more color to water Girish and I met

00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:02,090
about ready said yeah that's excellent

00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,950
and who should join the foundation I'll

00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,920
throw this question over to you dong

00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:09,440
from Alibaba vendors contributors

00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,910
committers who what are the what's the

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,000
sort of spectrum of folks who should

00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:16,040
join these kinds of operations oh yeah I

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,900
think that's a good question before

00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,870
answering that question that I I just

00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,440
wanted to quickly

00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:25,170
to two points the first I'd like to

00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,390
thank Facebook and the project pioneers

00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:31,320
who made the great a foundational presto

00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:34,320
and face will decided to open up to

00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:37,020
transfer the governing to the foundation

00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,350
so I think that's a that's a great great

00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:43,770
effort and the second one is that I

00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:47,730
think the for the way we talked to us

00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:49,830
before we rejoin the foundation and we

00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,380
talk to the Linux Foundation people and

00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:53,850
weed but at that time we know the

00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,610
difference between the leanest

00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:58,560
Foundation and like Apache project so

00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:01,430
the the big difference is that the Linda

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,310
Foundation can provide a professional

00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:06,540
management assistant effort to the

00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:09,270
foundation that's the big difference

00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,760
between Elena's foundation the Apache

00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,520
project because apart project it most

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,540
like the project has to run their

00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:21,330
project by their own right so there's no

00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,610
professional team to help but there is a

00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:27,590
Linux Foundation it provides all kind of

00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:30,000
help like a meeting organization and

00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,700
project management all those things I

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,740
think that that's great yeah and as to

00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:37,980
the question yeah I think the Nina's

00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:41,250
foundation open apps to both any user

00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:44,190
wonders and in technical individuals

00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:47,010
every everyone who has passion in the

00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:49,320
Presto in the technology we're welcome

00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:51,900
to join in the Nick and pre they can

00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:55,170
play different roles like they can

00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:58,320
contribute to the the code can

00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:00,390
contribute to the the future project

00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,670
directions they can contribute the user

00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:04,440
case and share their experience and

00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,500
there are a lot of things that awful

00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,960
people can share in to contribute to the

00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:14,160
community yeah yeah and that's actually

00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,930
a good segue to get into another area in

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,490
terms of developers right because

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,230
committers are at the core of ease of

00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,090
these operations committers are the ones

00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,680
who are coding and dedicating their time

00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:24,180
you do need management you need

00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,280
marketing you need all these other

00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,370
components to kind of weave together a

00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,020
good process and a good solution but the

00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,160
committers are the ones at the coalface

00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,440
again or ax

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,630
hacking out the code so from a developer

00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,339
perspective who wants to get involved

00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:43,559
what should they look for offer that

00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:46,770
over to Girish from uber so there are a

00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:50,130
couple of forums that the foundation

00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:53,220
supports to have developers engage and

00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:56,609
contribute to the community so the first

00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:59,280
is of course the the website and the

00:44:56,609 --> 00:45:01,440
github and the repository so you can

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,420
basically download the code it's free

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,640
you can take a look at the code it's

00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,099
open source and you can make

00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:11,700
modifications and contributions to the

00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:14,160
code by submitting a code request pull

00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,380
request over github right so there is no

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,450
barrier to entry there so you do not

00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,069
need to be engaged with the foundation

00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:21,990
at all you don't need to have anything

00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:23,549
to do you you just want to use the

00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:26,069
software but you want this one or two

00:45:23,549 --> 00:45:28,890
small fixes in you can just put that in

00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:31,049
get it reviewed by a committee and make

00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,670
that contribution and in the next

00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:34,950
release your changes are there and you

00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,990
can just use them and it's available for

00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:39,299
everybody else to use so I think the

00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:42,329
github repository the community process

00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:44,670
is the primary means where the vast

00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:46,920
majority of developers can engage and

00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,650
now if you want to get more involved if

00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,440
you want to for instance be involved in

00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:54,480
the technical direction maybe you have

00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,339
some opinions or some use cases where

00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,529
deeper changes are required in the

00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:00,750
engine itself so as you dong was

00:45:58,529 --> 00:46:03,450
mentioning you could get involved with

00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:05,069
technical steering committee so as Amit

00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,420
mentioned our technical steering

00:46:05,069 --> 00:46:08,609
committee meetings are free to the

00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,349
public so you are welcome to join you're

00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:14,190
welcome to contribute your thoughts or

00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:16,950
opinions your use cases and as you build

00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:18,900
your engagement with the community and

00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:22,559
your contributions to the code you can

00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:25,049
even get into a committer ship where you

00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,609
are recognized as a code leader and

00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:28,680
engineering leader in the community and

00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:31,520
you can also be part of the technical

00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:34,170
steering committee and help drive this a

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,109
direction if this is something that you

00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:39,599
want to do and engage with on a more

00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:43,230
full-time basis so in addition to these

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,930
two venues sorry another quick thing in

00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,609
addition to these venues I think I'm at

00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,910
we can talk more about this but we also

00:46:47,609 --> 00:46:53,849
organize a lot of community events and

00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:56,010
engagements and seminars and talks which

00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:58,619
I'll great base to come and interact

00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:00,180
directly with other folks yeah that's

00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:01,650
great I'm glad you mentioned to that so

00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,050
you don't have to become a committer you

00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:06,390
can just have an idea submit it to the

00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:09,270
organization and that can be reviewed

00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:11,490
and again many eyes make few the errors

00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:13,410
right because especially if you're

00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:15,540
working on a project I just what it's

00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:18,240
worth I know from just proofreading just

00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,859
being a writer you know what you wanted

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,930
to write it so you are not the best

00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:23,670
proof reader for your writing I think

00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,050
that's why you want other people looking

00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,390
at your code and looking at what you've

00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,950
achieved to get that perspective and to

00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:32,579
get that openness I think it's so that's

00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:33,690
a really brilliant point one thing to

00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:36,030
add to Garrosh's

00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:38,579
the committers do a good job of tagging

00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:39,869
some PRS as beginner right so if you

00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:41,730
just want to try out you don't know

00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:44,369
where to get started look for you know

00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:47,520
tags which say beginner and you know

00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:50,280
might be a you know small bug or of add

00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,869
a comment or update the dog so it could

00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,790
be you know you start simple and you go

00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:56,400
from there right and so there's a path

00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:58,549
of becoming a contributor it's kind of

00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,170
the first step and then from there

00:47:58,549 --> 00:48:02,609
committers committed which is based on

00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:05,790
merit the more you do the more you

00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:08,069
develop the more corps you be you get

00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:10,500
it's essentially that's the path it's a

00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:12,900
very clear path to becoming a committer

00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,670
that's that's open and given that it's

00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,790
open source you know everyone can see

00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:20,790
pr's and and everything that's going on

00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:23,819
in the project so just to add add on to

00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:25,170
what garage was saying earlier yeah

00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:27,540
that's great that's a really good point

00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:28,829
too right and it may be Amit Chopra do

00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,089
you want to kind of chime in on all that

00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:33,030
- what are your thoughts about all that

00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:35,130
yeah so I think one of the other aspects

00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:36,869
of you know the foundation we've had the

00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,579
governing board we also have a technical

00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:40,559
steering committee and then you also

00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:42,119
have this outreach group you know duties

00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,270
the the chairwoman and I work very

00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:48,839
closely with her given my team's focus

00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:50,609
also on community building we also we

00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,809
started with doing a couple of in

00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:55,020
percent meetups

00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:56,940
you know earlier this year and you know

00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:59,400
bringing the community together most of

00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,319
them were very berry eccentric

00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,579
that's where you know most of our

00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:06,059
companies were so we were largely

00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:07,500
focused there off recent given all the

00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:09,539
things that have been going on with

00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,549
travel restrictions and you know an

00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:13,589
ability to do in-person Meetup

00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:16,109
we actually decided to switch over to a

00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:18,390
virtual webinar kind of format and we've

00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:21,029
been seeing a huge interest and uptake

00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:23,640
in people who are joining from so many

00:49:21,029 --> 00:49:25,890
new places at this point one of the

00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,180
other things that we were doing like one

00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:29,819
of the things we were doing in this

00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:32,609
metaphor it was mostly that talks were

00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:34,680
driven by us from the core group of

00:49:32,609 --> 00:49:36,930
companies who were deeply involved and

00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,750
now we are actually encouraging and

00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:41,190
asking our n developers you know people

00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:43,680
who have built solutions who've used

00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:45,329
presto in a more innovative way to also

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,880
come and share some of their thoughts

00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:49,380
and that puts part you know you know

00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,359
community at a completely different

00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,730
level you know you would see another

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:56,250
organization has used presto to solve a

00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:58,849
problem in a specific way and that we

00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:01,950
hope should also spark more interest and

00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:04,470
engagement on the general as you said

00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:06,869
the developer side of our community not

00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:10,230
just the contributors side of community

00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:12,779
one morning I'll the other thing that

00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:15,150
you know did be mentioned on the 1b the

00:50:12,779 --> 00:50:18,180
the easy open issues the first good

00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,710
issues as we call them are teal the open

00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,690
source team also runs a number of

00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:23,609
programs not just for presto but for

00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:27,059
many other you know Facebook open source

00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:28,470
projects with my group and a group

00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:30,569
called the developer circles the

00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:32,279
Facebook developer circles they run a

00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:34,980
number of programs like they're starting

00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:37,799
a facebook an open-source immersion

00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,920
program there for a month they'll have a

00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:42,690
number of people look for these getting

00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,549
started issues so that you know they get

00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:47,279
comfortable and familiar with how to

00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:48,809
start their journey into open-source so

00:50:47,279 --> 00:50:51,990
that's not very best or specific but

00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:54,359
again you know my team focuses on some

00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:56,099
of the other products as well so just

00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:57,510
want to talk that no that's a really

00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:59,910
good point too and I know that Facebook

00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:01,589
and uber both have contributed heavily

00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,940
and they also have open source program

00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:05,339
offices you might have been alluding to

00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:08,549
that which again is another really good

00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:10,920
technique for formalizing the nature of

00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:12,660
the organization in which that that

00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,940
helps people that helps people kind of

00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,760
move

00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,319
all get involved in the first place and

00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,359
then course sort of advanced their work

00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:22,569
and I love the fact that you mentioned

00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:24,579
the concept of merit Dipti meritocracy

00:51:22,569 --> 00:51:27,310
we are increasingly in a society of

00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:29,440
merit meritocracies right whether that's

00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:31,510
in social media or encoding or in other

00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,579
places and I love that because people

00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:35,770
are then rewarded by their merits not

00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:37,569
just rewarded for who they are or where

00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,800
they've been for example or who you know

00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:41,470
right it's not what you know - you know

00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,910
but it's what you do these days and I

00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:45,430
think that's really cool so I'll throw

00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:47,650
it over to you dong from Alibaba to kind

00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:51,119
of comment on that as well yes I agree

00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:54,160
so I start developers so we we just we

00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,740
not only care about in a code and we

00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,050
development I also want to say the

00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:02,579
impact of the features we develop the

00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:07,540
right so is this a price to open-source

00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:12,130
so developers can contribute and in in

00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:14,619
these it just it just not to help just

00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:18,190
one company so you have the company or

00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:22,890
although a 100 although order war right

00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:26,050
so from American to Asia to Europe every

00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:28,480
company user impressed or can benefit

00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:30,670
from the co do development when your

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,250
community or your futures or code so

00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:37,119
that's a big achievement for developers

00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:39,819
yeah and yes and I've seen we also have

00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:42,520
a lot of different channels for

00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:44,829
developer to get familiar with

00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:48,010
suppressed oh we have slugs we have

00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:51,130
email lists and we have a website a lot

00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:56,829
have a channel for developer to get in

00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:58,089
get to the community yeah okay good

00:52:56,829 --> 00:52:59,829
that's a really good point

00:52:58,089 --> 00:53:01,359
and we have a couple really good

00:52:59,829 --> 00:53:03,430
questions from the audience so I want to

00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,810
be sure to get to those in the time and

00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,940
we're just burning through the hour here

00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:08,650
having so much fun I love learning from

00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,599
you folks there are a couple specific

00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,829
questions about pressure on what it does

00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:15,960
from the attendee so I want to throw

00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:19,300
those over to some of our speakers today

00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:22,869
I'll throw this one over to dipti very

00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:24,520
good question about data catalogues so

00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:26,860
how does Preston interact with data

00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:31,270
catalogues now that's a great quote

00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:32,380
so one of the things so you know we

00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:34,810
talked about earlier about how the

00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:37,000
database has been split open and there's

00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:38,920
many different parts to it one of the

00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,770
core pieces of the database was the

00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,920
catalog and with big data it's kind of

00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:48,670
split out and it's its own system

00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:52,000
typically for file based systems like

00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:53,380
HDFS data leaks like s3 you now need a

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,270
separate catalog you could use either

00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:57,970
hive meta store or you could use AWS

00:53:55,270 --> 00:54:01,540
glue which is also very popular and has

00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:03,400
to be integrated with presto now presto

00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:04,960
is a query engine and catalogs can be

00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,790
distributed and so it can talk to

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,590
multiple catalogs but that is something

00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:11,260
that the user needs to set up and

00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:13,000
integrate uber and and Facebook and

00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,940
Alibaba probably have done this on their

00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,940
own internally their developer is a

00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:21,550
manager hive meta store or a multiple of

00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:23,380
them perhaps and and that it can be

00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,410
quite tricky and so that's actually

00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:29,380
where a hana comes in is being the first

00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:32,260
company focused on press Tony the the

00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:34,390
open source project we want to make it

00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:36,040
easier for developers because while

00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:40,030
presto we've talked about how beautiful

00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:42,370
it is and the goodness of it it still

00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:45,610
can be quite tricky and and hard to use

00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:48,040
for developers that are not distributed

00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:51,670
systems engineers or you know PhDs and

00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:54,570
and and are just building an ad tech

00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:57,370
company right or a travel company or or

00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:59,920
another fire of a fin tech company and

00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:03,550
that's not kind of their core and so

00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:06,580
with a Hana we are working on making it

00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:09,190
easier to integrate all the components

00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:11,680
that are needed with presto DB right

00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,660
that's it around it and make it easier

00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,450
for users and and the end users and a

00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:19,270
catalog is one of them we if you look at

00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:21,450
one of the the new sand boxes that we

00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:24,100
have and there's a simple tutorial

00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:27,330
actually bundled it in so that people

00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:30,250
can get started and it's easy to use and

00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:33,520
it's an important component which

00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:36,820
exposes the metadata for the data that

00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:40,600
sits in beneath that prèsto needs access

00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:42,520
to so the goal of

00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,230
integrating that and you know having

00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,310
offerings with which we will there's

00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:47,680
more offerings that we will be

00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:50,440
announcing shortly will will help with

00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:54,100
some of that okay good and another good

00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:56,740
question from the audience is attendees

00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:59,980
asking how does presto solve the issue

00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:01,630
of query load on the systems that it's

00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:05,020
accessing can you talk about that maybe

00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:06,940
Girish or image I let it get each handle

00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:13,150
that one it's more on the technology

00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:19,180
technology side of presto I can take a

00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:20,800
crack at it so so as you're as you're

00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,990
deployed restore and as it becomes more

00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,700
and more popular in your organization

00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:26,500
obviously you will have run into good

00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,840
problems like lots of people only use it

00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,870
you wanna run large queries on it and so

00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:34,930
you run into scaling issues right so the

00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:38,440
way we handle those issues at uber and

00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:41,920
Facebook is basically you can set up

00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:45,280
multiple presto clusters so you can

00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,950
basically have a bunch of clusters which

00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,440
can which which can handle different

00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:52,330
kind of query loads so as you see more

00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,310
and more traffic you start seeing

00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:56,140
patterns right you'll see some queries

00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:58,150
need to run right away because someone's

00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,800
waiting at the terminal to see the

00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,730
results maybe they're using a pen

00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,620
superset

00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:05,110
then there are certain class of queries

00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,910
whether like maybe ETL jobs or maybe off

00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:09,190
and dashboard which are updated once a

00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:10,810
day and these are more of a batch more

00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:12,400
queries so then you can have these

00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:15,400
different clusters which is which are

00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:18,340
tuned to different query characteristics

00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,980
and different kind of optimization

00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:22,870
points and then you you basically are

00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,880
able to segregate your traffic and have

00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:26,800
them run on different clusters optimized

00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,570
for these different query workloads so

00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,040
this is kind of what we do at uber and

00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,450
Facebook and so forth so we have

00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,940
different clusters tuned for different

00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:35,830
workloads and interactive queries you

00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:39,040
make sure that they are fast they're big

00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:40,150
and users have little resistance and

00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,690
that's how we provide a good user

00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:45,010
experience okay good that's a great

00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:46,060
answer we've got a bunch of questions

00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:47,020
coming in from the audience I don't

00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,480
think we'll have time for them but I

00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,920
didn't want to get to at least one more

00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,090
topic and frankly I'd love to do this

00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,100
again next week

00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:56,540
to get at this ones I want to get

00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:59,210
philosophical with you guys but there

00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:01,430
isn't time there are there is a new

00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:04,850
project - so this presto D beam is also

00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:06,710
presto sequel D can you comment on that

00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:11,030
what does that mean is it significant

00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:14,810
it's a fork in the road basically yes

00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:16,190
so you know I can share and more to to

00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:19,310
my answer

00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:21,470
Facebook was open-source best 2 dB I

00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:24,470
think 2013 or maybe even earlier than

00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:26,750
that and that's been the the core presto

00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:30,230
project for a long time some time last

00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:32,120
year plus 2 sequel for Tov and and so

00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,860
there's presto DB which is a part of the

00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:36,080
foundation which all of us are part of

00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:39,320
we've been talking about and presto

00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:42,980
sequel is the fork that that exists the

00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:44,540
philosophies of the the kind of the main

00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:47,330
project in the fork our little bit

00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:48,590
different we hope that we've been

00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:52,370
talking about how important it is for

00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:55,460
the community we hope that presto sequel

00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:58,520
can you know merge back in over time it

00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:01,340
is a it's always hard to merge back

00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:03,710
Forks in but but it's the right thing to

00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:05,510
do for the community and that's that's

00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:07,570
what you know we've we've actually been

00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:10,670
working on trying to try and figure out

00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:13,520
but but you know sometimes you have my

00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:16,700
sequel and you have MariaDB right and

00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,590
that's ok and that's just open source

00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:21,860
that's the beauty of open source you can

00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:24,590
do it it is a little bit confusing that

00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:26,780
they're the same name very similar very

00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:28,940
similar names and we hope that gets

00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:31,580
resolved in the future I'm if anything

00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:33,200
more add to that yeah I I think the key

00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:34,910
thing is it'll be actively working to

00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,710
resolve this issue for the benefit of

00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:38,420
our community and the direction of the

00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:41,830
project so stay tuned you know hopefully

00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:44,270
you should have resolutions soon yeah

00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:46,700
yeah that's a really good point and for

00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:48,680
those who don't know what did they just

00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:51,820
mention there my sequel talking to Maria

00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:55,220
DB that happened Monte with Aeneas who

00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:59,030
started my sequel did that for the day

00:59:55,220 --> 01:00:01,700
that Oracle thought son thank you

00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:03,440
sending a message they're both but

01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,890
listen thank you to all of you out there

01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,110
I hope we get to do this again I

01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:09,940
go forward this these questions to our

01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:11,860
presenters today so they get back to you

01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:14,200
but this is a really big deal folks I

01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,700
think we're on a path to great things I

01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,800
think this layer of abstraction is

01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:20,530
exactly what we've needed so that we

01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,870
don't get lost in a silo here or there

01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:24,430
seeing the big picture that's the magic

01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:26,380
that's the key for the future of

01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:29,020
analytics and the future of information

01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:31,030
design and information business so folks

01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:33,130
thank you so much thanks to the folks

01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:34,870
from Ohana for Kaizen this you all work

01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,610
been fantastic I really appreciate your

01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:37,420
time we'll talk to you next time folks

01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:40,890
we'll do it again

01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:40,890
