Title: Optimizing Presto for Uber scale
Publication date: 2020-07-08
Playlist: Presto Events
Description: 
	Vivek Bharathan, Sr. Software Engineer at Uber

In this talk, we present some of the work streams we have underway at Uber to optimize Presto performance. In particular, we will cover enabling aggregation pushdown in queries in order to use statistics in the file headers/footers, our investigations into and attempts to efficiently executing approximate queries, and our experience with humongous object allocation in Presto. With the broader Presto community's support and pending their interest, we look forward to giving back some of these new features.
