Description: 
	Dante Pawlow, Data Engineer at Jampp
Fede Palladoro, DevOps & Data Infrastructure Lead at Jampp

Jampp is a mobile app marketing platform that uses programmatic ads to acquire new users and retarget those users with relevant ads. It sits between advertisers and their audiences, so real time bidding of media advertising space is critical for their business. The amount of data Jampp generates as part of the bidding cycle is massive - 1.7B events are tracked per day, 550K/sec requests are received, and 100TB of data is processed by AWS elastic load balancers per day.

PrestoDB plays a critical role in their data infrastructure. Jampp relies on EMR Presto for their ad-hoc queries and performs over 3K ad-hoc queries/day on over 600TB of queryable data. In this presentation, Dante and Fede will show Jampp’s data architecture, how they’re training their machine learning algorithms directly from Presto to identify potential purchasers, and why Presto has become 24/7 critical to ensure ads are relevant to users.
