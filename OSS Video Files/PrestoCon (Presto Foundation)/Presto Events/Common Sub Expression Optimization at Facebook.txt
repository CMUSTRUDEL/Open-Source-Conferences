In complex analytics queries, we often see repeated expressions, for example parsing the same JSON column but extracting different fields, elaborate CASE statement with common predicates and different ones. Previously, Presto will compute the same expression many times as they appear in query. With common sub expression optimization, we would only evaluate the same expression once within the same project operator or filter operator. In our workload, weâ€™ve seen 3x improvements on certain queries with expensive common sub expressions like JSON_PARSE. Microbenchmark also shows a consistent ~10% performance improvement for simple common sub-expressions like x + y. In this talk, we will talk about how this is implemented.
