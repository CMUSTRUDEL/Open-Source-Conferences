Title: Parquet Column Level Access Control with Presto
Publication date: 2020-11-17
Playlist: Presto Events
Description: 
	Apache Parquet is the major columnar file storage format used by Apache Presto and several other query engines in many big data analytic frameworks today. In a lot of use cases, a portion of the column data is highly sensitive and must be protected. Column encryption at the file format level is supported in the Parquet community. Due to the rewritten code of Parquet in Presto, Parquet column encryption at Presto needs to be ported with modifications to the Presto code page. And the integration with Key Management Service (KMS) and other query engines like Hive and Spark is another challenge.

In this talk, we will show the work we have done for enabling Presto for Parquet column decryption including challenges, solutions, integration with Hive/Spark Parquet column encryption and look forward to the next step of encryption work.
