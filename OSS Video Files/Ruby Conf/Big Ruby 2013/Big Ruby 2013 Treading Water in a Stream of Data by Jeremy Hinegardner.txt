Title: Big Ruby 2013 Treading Water in a Stream of Data by Jeremy Hinegardner
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Big Ruby 2013
Description: 
	Data arrives in all sorts of forms, more and more today we are seeing data arrive in event-like systems: server logs, twitter, superfeedr notifications, github events, rubygems web hooks, couchdb change notifications, etc. We want to analyze streams of data, and find useful pieces of information in them.

In this talk, using an existing dataset, we will go through the process of obtaining, manipulating, processing, analyzing and storing a stream of data. We will attempt to touch upon a variety of possible topics including: differences between processing static datasets and stream datasets, pitfalls of stream processing, analyzing data in real time and using the datastream itself as data source.
