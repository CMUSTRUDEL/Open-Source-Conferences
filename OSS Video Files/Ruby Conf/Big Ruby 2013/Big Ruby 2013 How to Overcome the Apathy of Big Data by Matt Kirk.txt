Title: Big Ruby 2013 How to Overcome the Apathy of Big Data by Matt Kirk
Publication date: 2020-01-28
Playlist: Big Ruby 2013
Description: 
	We all know data is growing at a rapid pace and our ability to store it has become cheap. But what do we do with all this data? Do you feel overwhelmed with the infinite amounts of decisions you could make?

Big data was supposed to improve how businesses run, though in most cases it has complicated process. We have become apathetic to the amounts of data that are bombarding us.

This talk aims to help overcome this apathy towards the sheer amount of information out there. It will teach you how to come up with methods to finding metrics, and new dashboards specifically for your business.

We will talk about:

   Backward induction, or goal based metrics.
   Classification algorithms for making sense of data.
   Graphing in higher dimensions.

By the end of this session, you will know how to be effective with data. You will understand how to find what you are looking for, how to classify it, and how to visually make sense of it all.

	00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:25,380
so the other day I was at my

00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:28,140
grandmother's house and she needed some

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,759
help going through a lot of paper that

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,740
she has accumulated over the years and

00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:33,629
so she invites me in the back this

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,059
little tiny extra room that she has in

00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:39,510
her apartment and in the corner she's

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,269
got this small card table with

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,820
leatherette type cover it still has the

00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:50,729
tag on it and then about 30 inches of

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:52,820
paper now before raid levels my

00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,710
grandmother knew all about redundancy

00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,979
she kept three copies of absolutely

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,519
everything three copies of her 1949 tax

00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:04,170
return three copies of a random

00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,680
advertisement about glucosamine

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,930
supplements she kept three copies of

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,409
everything and she's going through the

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,530
paper one by one by one and I'm sitting

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:20,940
there losing patience and she comes upon

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:25,470
this 1947 playbill of when she was in

00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:27,570
the freshman play at university of puget

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,030
sound and goes off on a tirade about how

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,460
great that was and I was in the play and

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:39,780
everybody loved it and then she puts it

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:45,060
back my grandma is a data hoarder she

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:48,870
used to be a librarian and she really

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,480
likes to hold on to information she

00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,190
likes it around her because even though

00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,640
that play ball is not important right

00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,490
now it might be important in a year from

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,420
now or maybe some days she might need to

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:08,099
look at that 1975 tax return you never

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,200
know now I'm sure everybody here has a

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,879
family member who's a hoarder who likes

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,670
to hoard on two different things and we

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,790
say oh well yeah well I don't do that i

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,680
get rid of all of my stuff and I'm

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:22,740
perfect but I would argue that this not

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,690
necessarily the case so if you've heard

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,930
of inbox zero there's a lot of people

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,560
that go with inbox infinity where you

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,110
look over there

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,489
the shoulder in you see that they have

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:39,840
about eight thousand messages and 3,000

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:43,230
of them are unread okay so they don't

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,599
read their messages it's so why are they

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,190
holding on to this and generally

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,310
speaking it's it's because of a

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,590
compulsive hoarding a feeling that we

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,680
get where we need to hold on to every

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,340
bit of information as it comes through

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,950
just in case our boss asks us about that

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:06,750
Nigerian bank account that we need to

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:09,150
forward to him later it's even worse

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,420
than our own personal quirks it's turned

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,250
into an entire industry I'm sure

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,980
everybody's here is heard of big data

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,250
it's amazing that we have five exabytes

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,840
of data being created every two days we

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,269
have all this information everybody's

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,160
connected on iPhones they're connected

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,440
on social media they're connected on

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,680
email you name it and we have all of

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,359
this information but I would say that

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,780
this big data has really just become

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:41,370
more of a big distraction unfortunately

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,299
if any of you have ever looked at the

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,670
Twitter live stream as it comes through

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:50,880
most of the time it is total garbage it

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,760
is just the same people tweeting the

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,230
same thing about Justin Bieber or kim

00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:02,480
kardashian or something in portuguese

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:06,090
that you can't even quite understand so

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,730
that gets us to the real point of this

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,150
talk which is if we have all this

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,769
information that's great but what's more

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,630
important is figuring out the twenty

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,180
percent of all this information that

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,769
really really outcomes for the eighty

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,070
percent if any of you ever heard of the

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:25,200
8020 principle it's very simple twenty

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,270
percent equals the eighty percent output

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,400
I would almost go further to say that

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:37,650
big data is kind of a 90 91 % of

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:39,539
principle so very quickly I'm going to

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,700
go over a couple techniques which there

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,270
are many techniques of seeing through

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,300
the noise

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,490
of the data that we have access to but

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,440
today since our time is limited I'm

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:55,140
going to go through backwards induction

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,790
which is a game theory tactic to to

00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,680
start with the end in mind and then work

00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,140
for words we're going to go over a

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,800
couple different techniques for graphing

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,720
in more than three dimensions and then

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,960
we're going to end with a very meaty

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,660
portion which is a variable selection so

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,280
this is kind of a new topic but it's

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,900
using machine learning and

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,000
classification trees to determine what

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:27,060
variables are important which ones

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:32,130
aren't so just a quick poll who who does

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:34,260
a TDD here ok who has ever had to

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:39,390
explain to a boss why you should be able

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:41,340
to do TDD ok now personally I've had

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,340
this conversation a lot of times with

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,340
business leaders saying we really need

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,160
to do TDD because we'll get the

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,710
insurance it's it's great because we'll

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,030
have full code coverage will have the

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,100
ability to make sure that all of our

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,380
tests are completely covered but then

00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,940
they say oh well that's going to take

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,270
thirty percent more time and I don't

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,950
have that time so then you have this

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:09,150
conflict between long-term benefit and

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,620
short term costs and so if you look up

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,290
here at now this isn't necessarily a

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,380
tree diagram but it's they call it the

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,690
bifurcation graph it's a it's a nice

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,180
example in chaos theory of how things

00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,420
get totally screwed up and the way I

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,270
think about it is if you start from the

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,430
left and you set if you make a decision

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,130
and you say should I go left or right

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,650
and you keep doing that on and on and on

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:36,450
then it just gets totally chaotic

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,330
because if you've ever seen a tree that

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:42,360
grows more and more you'll get into

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:46,380
these two these ruts now going back to

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,790
the TDD example a business leader looks

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,410
at it in the short term so they're

00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:53,730
saying okay well I have to spend more

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:56,080
time more money on testing but the

00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:59,259
programmer is saying ok the long term

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,389
benefit is way better this gets us into

00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:04,060
the same thing that game theorists we're

00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:07,300
dealing with where you look at a game

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,550
like chess and realistically what you

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,280
want to do is you want to start ten

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,949
moves ahead 30 moves ahead if you can do

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,789
it and then work backwards how to get to

00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:21,340
that move so very simply backwards

00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:23,590
induction is kind of thinking with the

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,159
end in mind and then working for words

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:30,669
or yeah so therefore instead of saying

00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:32,800
oh well we have this data what are we

00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:34,900
going to do with it should we go left or

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:41,199
right it doesn't matter you need to

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:42,550
focus on the goal first now I'm assuming

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,610
most people here are probably using

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:49,629
rails and they're building a web app of

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:53,409
some sort and i would say that in most

00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:59,199
cases web apps kind of fall into the the

00:07:53,409 --> 00:08:00,810
dave mcclure our metrics model so if any

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,849
of you have ever heard of dave mcclure

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,969
he he runs something called 500 startups

00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:09,669
which is a was an incubator and he came

00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:11,409
up with this idea that all metrics that

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,690
are important fall into these five

00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,550
buckets and it's easy to remember

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,440
because you can just talk like a pirate

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:22,960
whenever you feel like it quickly its

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,500
acquisition so user growth activation

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,500
users doing something retention keeping

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:33,459
them around referral and then revenue

00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:36,279
obviously revenues is important now if

00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:38,969
you know this and you know where you're

00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,500
going what you're trying to accomplish

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,690
then it's a lot simpler than just saying

00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,510
that we have the data let's do something

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,649
with it it's more a question of saying

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:53,980
okay I have I want to bring up users I

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:58,180
want more users or acquisition how do we

00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:02,170
get there so very simply I just threw

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:04,899
some random ideas it could be that

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,930
spending more money the pay-per-click

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:08,990
advertising retweets about whoever you

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,520
are

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,380
or the amount of times that you swear in

00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,300
a sentence any of those things could

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:21,410
mean more users now it's a lot simpler

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,050
than saying we have google analytics how

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,800
do we get more users it's you're looking

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:32,209
at the goal first and backing this out

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:35,690
even further you can say how does pay

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:39,980
per click advertising relate to growth

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:43,370
in users as simply it's just graphing it

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,420
out looking at how the correlation goes

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,310
together and then saying okay perfect

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,589
now a quick side note correlation not

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,000
causation just because I woke up in the

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:55,670
morning and I drank a cup of coffee that

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,220
does not mean that I wrote Rose the Sun

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,850
from its horizon it's just correlated

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,850
but unfortunately correlation is most

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:08,750
likely what you have to work with

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:15,700
causation is kind of a qualitative

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:19,630
measure okay so another quick poll who

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:22,250
who like Star Wars more than Star Trek

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:26,510
okay who like Star Trek more than Star

00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:34,130
Wars okay pretty evenly split who

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:36,860
doesn't care yeah alright so most of you

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,540
probably recognize this guy if any of

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,510
you seen the Star Trek next generation

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,790
this is Geordi LaForge and probably one

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,160
of my favorite characters of all time he

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:49,670
also known as a reading rainbow guy in

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,790
case you don't know who this is probably

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:56,029
is I think he's awesome because he's

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,370
this guy who has this visor on his face

00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:01,310
and he can see things that nobody else

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,010
can see so a couple episodes he was

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:07,810
looking at a bulkhead and said oh this

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:10,640
has got a crack in it pretty cool right

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,740
plus it's levar burton so if any of you

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,160
did watch Reading Rainbow I mean that's

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:22,040
kind of cool too I guess so this gets us

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:27,100
in the thing of visualizing things now

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:29,329
most of the time if you can visualize

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,670
then you can quickly disseminate

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:33,290
information that's really what's so

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,199
great about visualization is that you

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:39,259
can see patterns our ability to

00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:42,949
recognize patterns is unparalleled it's

00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:45,529
it's very we're good at pattern

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:47,750
recognition but unfortunately we cannot

00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:53,569
see more than three dimensions we can

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:55,810
see depth width and height but there are

00:11:53,569 --> 00:12:00,100
some solutions to squeak out more

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:04,430
dimensions and those are very quickly

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,720
color tables glyph plots which I'll get

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:11,000
into more a little bit later in

00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:13,160
scatterplot matrices so generally

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,759
speaking when you're working with lots

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,920
of variables it's it's a nice way to

00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,350
just start with tables tables are easy

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,779
there easy to do start with tables

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,190
you're not visualizing anything but it's

00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:29,720
there and everybody knows how to use

00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:32,269
excel how as soon as you get past tables

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,760
and you can get into this color so if

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:37,130
any of you've ever used crazy egg you'll

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,060
notice this this is a really awesome use

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:44,060
of color where it tracks user clicks on

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,730
the page and then aggregates it so that

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,680
then you can say this gets clicked a lot

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:53,120
more therefore people are interacting it

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,850
with with a lot more and you can

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,029
basically squeak out an extra dimension

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:04,220
so you could graph three dimensions with

00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:08,750
color on it kind of useful a scatterplot

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:12,019
matrices are also super super useful if

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,939
you have more than four dimensions and

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,550
you want to see how things are related

00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:18,410
to each other scatterplot matrices all

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,550
they really do is they say for each

00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:25,089
variable I'm going to plot the 2d

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:27,860
representation of that so therefore

00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:31,100
you're able to look at 100 different

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:34,610
dimensions easily in a discernible

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,870
fashion the nice benefit to this is that

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,900
you will also be able to

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,480
see how variables like the exes are

00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,190
related to each other as well so

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,839
therefore you be able to say that these

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,620
two variables while I thought they were

00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:53,270
different are actually not and the last

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:56,240
one is probably my favorite so it's the

00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:00,140
glyph plot or in this case a turn-off

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:05,150
faces so has anybody heard of Chernov

00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:09,170
faces before okay hey so there was this

00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:13,130
guy Chernov think in the 70s he came up

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:15,140
he was doing a study on judges and how

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:19,279
people reacted to judges and how they

00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:21,890
thought about them and the idea was he

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,020
wanted to take i think it was 12

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,400
different attributes of these judges and

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,279
then map it to something that people

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,570
could easily easily visualize and he

00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:33,800
came up with something quite ingenious

00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:37,040
which is using faces which as human

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,550
beings were able to recognize emotions

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,690
in faces very easily we can see when

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:48,970
somebody's upset surprised angry

00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:51,650
confused and so he came up with a very

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,860
intelligent way of putting together

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:57,380
faces now since this is ruby conference

00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:01,850
i figured that i might as well do an

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,620
example of turn off faces and if any of

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,740
you are on your computers which it seems

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,160
like not very many are you're welcome to

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,260
take a look at the the repo it's just

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,279
right up there it's a slice hex canoe /

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:21,890
Chernov so if any of you've ever worked

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:25,100
with shoes before shoes is a a GUI tool

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:28,070
and it was started by lucky stiff and

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,490
its really pretty awesome for making

00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:39,260
simple graphical user interfaces with

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:43,180
pure Ruby code so let me everybody see

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,180
that or is it good

00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:54,360
lots of audience participation on that

00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:57,030
one alright so very very quickly the

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,740
shoes app is just this is very simple

00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:01,580
I'm just going to create an eight by

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:05,760
twelve matrix of little turn off faces

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:09,930
this face painter class right here is

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:13,020
nutso I just kind of quickly hacked a

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,390
lot of this together so please excuse

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,810
the messy code really all you need to

00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:22,950
know is that there is a variable for

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:25,650
let's see head size eyebrow slant

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:28,320
cross-eyed Ness pupil size I wit I

00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:32,480
height I area no sighs mouths mouths

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:36,420
whip and smile very important variable

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:45,210
so running that we get something like

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:47,670
this a bunch of smiley faces yeah all

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,680
right and just to prove that I'm not

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:55,580
making this up I'll run it again and

00:16:49,680 --> 00:17:00,950
there's more smiley faces and more now

00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,950
of course it's all fine and dandy but

00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:07,080
what is the point of using Chernov faces

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,290
right it seems like kind of a novelty

00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,170
thing that's kind of fun right not

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:15,900
really that useful I would beg to differ

00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:18,510
so there's a lot of companies out there

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:21,000
right now like radian6 there's another

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:24,000
company cissa most map which do this

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,320
sentiment analysis so a lot of people

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,360
are talking about sentiment analysis

00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,220
right now and what they're doing is

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,500
they're saying for all of the textual

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,350
data that's been talked about is it

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,840
positive negative or neutral now if any

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,690
of you know emotions and people well

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,410
enough you realize that emotions are not

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:45,900
a one dimensional problem it's it could

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:51,630
be negative and somebody is very sad

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:54,810
angry they could be ambivalent there's

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,860
so many ranges of motion and turn off

00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,580
faces are really

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,710
in a unique position of presenting that

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,710
information quickly so that you can look

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,720
at a face and say the sentiment is this

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:15,900
not the sentiment is positive or the

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:19,679
sentiment is neutral so when I was it a

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:23,280
start-up in Seattle we would get

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,880
together every Monday in this tiny room

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,620
every single Monday we'd have a company

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,120
meeting all company meeting every monday

00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,530
and at every month every monday meeting

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,320
there would be the analyst who get up

00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,970
for his 11 and a half minutes and he

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,059
would talk about how we did last week

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,100
and how he did the week before but he

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,260
didn't quite just talk about that he

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,690
talked about how we did pageviews

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,850
uniques the standard deviation of the

00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,549
page views standard deviation of the

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:57,299
uniques he'd talk about growth growth of

00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:59,820
growth he talked about kurtosis skew a

00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:02,160
bunch of things that even me being a

00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,870
Matthew type guy I couldn't stand

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,230
because I was just like okay that's

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:10,049
great i'm going to go back to work now I

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:12,240
really didn't care like if he was

00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:14,130
talking about growth why couldn't he

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,590
just talked about how he did last week

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,419
in terms of uniques the week before and

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,490
what the difference was and leave it at

00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,580
that and that gets us into the next

00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:26,000
section which is there are so many

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:29,610
variables at our disposal right now

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,290
there are people who take texts and turn

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:36,740
it into a variable you could you could

00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:40,169
say just about anything as a variable

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:43,559
but most of the variables aren't really

00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:45,450
that important so in the case of this

00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,780
analyst guy he would give us all of

00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:52,530
these this information that really

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:58,200
didn't impact how I was running or how I

00:19:52,530 --> 00:20:01,080
was working that day and so we're going

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,600
to talk about how to use classification

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,600
trees to determine what variables are

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,190
important in what aren't as anybody

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,539
heard of a classification tree or a

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:15,359
regression tree

00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:17,989
okay a couple so very very simply here's

00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,269
an example that I stole off of Wikipedia

00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:24,419
it's the example of the probability that

00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:26,999
you would survive from the Titanic it's

00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,609
simple in that are you male yes or no

00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:33,330
are you over the age of nine and a half

00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:35,190
yes or no and is your siblings and

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:42,599
spouse greater than two and a half

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:43,879
simple right now building these there's

00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,279
many different ways of building

00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:49,229
classification trees so there's bagging

00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:53,009
which is short for bootstrap aggregating

00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:55,080
there's boost trees but my honest

00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:58,979
favorite is something called a random

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,659
forest now I always kind of get the the

00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:03,029
idea in my mind that random forests are

00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:06,539
full of random deer in random mushrooms

00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:09,899
but I don't maybe that's why I like

00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:13,289
random for us it was come up with this

00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:17,729
guy this guy came up with it in 2001 his

00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:21,119
name was Leo bryman and it's it's

00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:22,739
interesting in that he was a PhD super

00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,239
mathy guy then he went out and became a

00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,970
consultant and then he went back to

00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:31,139
academia so it's actually quite useful

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:34,340
and very simply all it really does is it

00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:37,559
randomly goes through a big data set

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:39,090
creates these random trees and then from

00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,450
all those random trees it figures out

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:47,519
which one has the most predictive power

00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:48,960
pretty simple right now there's lots of

00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:53,070
tools out there for making random

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:57,239
forests Python has one java obviously

00:21:53,070 --> 00:22:00,299
has wound with out but also ruby has one

00:21:57,239 --> 00:22:03,840
as well it's called Nimbus you can go to

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:07,070
nibix gym org it's primarily garnered

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,499
towards the bioinformatics world and

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:13,830
genetics but it's actually quite useful

00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:17,369
as well we'll find out in just using

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:19,019
random forests so I wanted to do another

00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,840
example but this one a little bit more

00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,590
applicable and really what I wanted to

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,840
do is

00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:29,100
look at all of the tweets that I've ever

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,230
made and figure out what factors what

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,940
variables are the things that determine

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:36,840
whether i'm going to retweet something

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:39,000
or not so all I basically the idea is

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,640
out of all of the text that has ever

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,309
been tweeted out of my Twitter account

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:48,029
which which words are going to determine

00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:53,340
whether I retweet or not so again the

00:22:48,029 --> 00:23:00,419
code is up put it github it so if you

00:22:53,340 --> 00:23:04,200
want to look at it very quickly here is

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:06,809
anybody use the T gem ever if you

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:11,090
haven't it's a pretty awesome Joan it's

00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:13,440
just a very simple like command line and

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,690
command line interface to twitter and

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,039
you can do really awesome things like I

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:23,250
just exported all of my oops hello all

00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:26,130
of my Twitter are all of my tweets that

00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,809
I've ever made into a CSV file you can

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:33,270
do other really awesome things so quick

00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:36,929
plug there from there I just went

00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:39,539
through all of it so sucked in all of

00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:42,539
the CSV split everything up into

00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:44,309
different tokens very simple tokenizer I

00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:46,890
didn't spend a whole lot of time on this

00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:51,600
and put it into a dictionary which is

00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:53,760
just a sorted all of the words that I've

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,750
ever made sorted so that therefore I can

00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,510
have like different variables running

00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:03,929
through all of this created a training

00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:09,240
set which is just a bunches of ones and

00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:13,289
zeros so if you if you look at a row it

00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,179
would be retweet one or zero so if it's

00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,610
one that means that i retweeted it if

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:21,960
it's zero that means i didn't ID

00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:26,610
followed by one's for all of the words

00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:30,000
that I that I used now after doing that

00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:33,929
I had to create a config file which is

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,270
pretty simple and then run Nimbus in

00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:39,090
this

00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,559
in the folder now that took a long time

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:49,549
to run so i'm not going to run it right

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:49,549
now but what it did is that it created a

00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,679
classification tree so like after you

00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:58,470
run Nimbus and 15 minutes later after

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,070
you've had your coffee it came back and

00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:04,110
I was looking at basically a

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:05,340
classification tree saying these are the

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,070
questions that you need to ask whether

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:10,500
it's something will be retweeted or not

00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:14,280
from that though gets into the question

00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,740
of which variables are more important

00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,549
than the other one so what text is more

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:24,630
important and so there's two ways of

00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:27,540
doing that in random forest land one of

00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,460
them is called variable important serve

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:33,179
imp a lot of people like to call it and

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:37,940
really what that is is determining the

00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:43,679
the sway of each individual variable on

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:45,179
the actual end result so you can it's a

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,140
little bit complicated and there's

00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:51,030
there's a it's a little over my head in

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,730
terms of what they're using for the for

00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:56,549
the statistics but more or less from

00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,890
what I understand it's it's really just

00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:01,980
that it's how much a variable sway is

00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,900
the end result but I think an easier way

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,750
of thinking about this is what they call

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,990
minimum depth so actually if I back up

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:12,150
here a little bit you look at this

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,620
classification tree and the most

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:17,850
important variable in this

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:20,940
classification tree is gender because

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:25,110
it's at the very top so if you think

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:27,390
about how gender is the most influential

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:31,679
variable then you can say age is the

00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:36,570
second-most and siblings plus spouses or

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:40,730
well spouse hopefully got to catch

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:44,190
myself on that one spouse their spouse

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,260
is the third so it's it's a lot easier

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,299
of a way to think about variable

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,840
importance by just saying the most

00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:53,159
important

00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,860
variables are towards the top now that's

00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:59,130
all fine and dandy again but let's get

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,470
to something that's really meaty so what

00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,000
are the variables that determine whether

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,159
i'm going to retweet something or not

00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,120
and i just took the top 4 which all

00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:10,950
happened to be very specific people so

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,559
just to go quickly through this the top

00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,080
guy is this management consultant who

00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,059
writes the funniest tweets and I tend to

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,340
retweet them the second one is my wife

00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:24,720
if I didn't retweet her I would be

00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:27,330
sleeping on the couch a third Abdi Abdi

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,159
grim and Matt might if you don't know

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:32,880
Matt might he's really pretty awesome

00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:36,720
too now examples of the tweets that i

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,090
retweeted so i really like this one I'm

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,870
going to do a training really on the way

00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:44,700
home will you do a driving mm-hmm I

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:48,990
really hate the word training as a as a

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:53,840
noun by the way Hitler was a

00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:53,840
micromanager yeah I think that's funny

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,409
everybody can probably relate to this

00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:02,549
when holy crap all caps recruiter do you

00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:04,500
have a job lead for me and this one's

00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:06,510
actually interesting because it kind of

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,399
relates to this talk and that more data

00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:16,250
it does does a little good unless it

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:19,080
becomes more information so now that

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,870
you're able to pick out which variables

00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,549
are more important than others then you

00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,649
get into the real question of how this

00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:30,960
relates to what we're talking about

00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:33,690
before so if you can say okay these

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,299
variables are what's important then I

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,890
only need to really graph those or if

00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,179
these variables are important those are

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:44,419
the only ones that I need to work

00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:46,710
backwards from or try and model now

00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:49,980
what's really interesting is there is a

00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:55,140
guy who is from University of Florida

00:28:49,980 --> 00:29:00,000
his name is hey Mont ish Warren I don't

00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:02,190
know the spelling but he did a study

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,259
about cardiovascular disease

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,149
and was really interesting is that he

00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:09,090
was using the techniques that we were

00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:12,240
talking about here and he had 310 ish

00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:14,759
variables and after applying these

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:19,200
techniques he was able to take the 310

00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:22,230
and turn it into 10 now that's huge

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,169
because you're taking all of the noise

00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:27,049
out of what you're looking at and if

00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:30,990
you're only looking at 10 variables

00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:34,529
that's it that's an easily visualized

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:41,879
abul thing that's something that you can

00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:45,389
wrap your mind around so remember to

00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:47,220
start with the end of mind it's so

00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:48,450
important when we have the amount of

00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,970
information that we have at our

00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:53,100
fingertips everybody has their phones we

00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:55,919
have social media we have email we have

00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,259
IMS we have text messaging we have all

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,450
of this data if you don't start with a

00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:05,940
goal in mind then you're going to end up

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:09,230
completely lost it's also important to

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:12,059
figure out how you can visualize data

00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,370
because if you can visualize it and you

00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:17,899
can conceptualize it then you can

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:21,360
understand it a lot easier and lastly

00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:24,090
classification trees are super super

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,669
useful for determining what variable is

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,850
more important than the other one and

00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:32,149
it's very simple to conceptualize how

00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:35,519
the ones at the top are more influential

00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:40,679
and so if I was to leave you with one

00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:42,870
thing and one thing only remember to not

00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,649
be like my grandmother and not hold on

00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:49,129
to data because it's not really

00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:52,129
important how much data you have the

00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:55,279
important thing is what you do with it

00:30:52,129 --> 00:30:55,279
thank you

00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:14,100
