alright so I want to ask everybody to

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:30,090
stand up you I mean you had to know that

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,250
I was going to do this at some point in

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,050
the talk right okay I was going to ask

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,699
you to do an exercise called the Hindu

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,080
squat but I don't think we're gonna have

00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:40,559
enough room with the cinema style

00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,120
seating so we're going to do is sort of

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,100
a Hindu half squat all right so

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,019
everybody get a little space behind for

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,780
uh between you and the seat behind you

00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:51,690
put your arms out in front of you palms

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,120
facing down and then just squat down

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,979
until you tap the seat behind you and

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,190
thrust your arms into your chest and

00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:00,780
then swing your arms back up in front of

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,710
you sort of spring up all right

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:09,869
everybody ready and down and up down and

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:14,159
up down and up down and up one more down

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:19,280
and up okay all right thank you thank

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,280
you you can sit down now we're done and

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:27,450
you're you're ready to watch my talk now

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,580
because your mind has been turned on and

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,900
it's ready to learn your heart rates

00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,880
probably a little bit elevated which

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,830
means blood is pumping more rapidly to

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,770
your brain and that can actually create

00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,630
a short-term improvement in cognition

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,120
problem solving skills food intelligence

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,090
and memory and it even promotes the

00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,760
growth of new brain cells so the title

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,970
of my talk is build a bigger brain and I

00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,440
actually mean that somewhat literally in

00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,020
just the last few years five or six

00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,360
years a ton of science has emerged that

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,090
actually explains the mechanisms behind

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,520
how the movement of our body relates to

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,870
the function of our brain so I'm going

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,030
to talk about some of that science today

00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,550
I'm going to explain how it relates to

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,649
you and your duties as a programmer I'm

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,870
going to sort of distill it down into

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,540
just some essential specific exercises

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,610
or specific activities that you can do

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,640
every day to improve your health boost

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,319
your brainpower mitigate pain and even

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,170
reduce your risk for disease and a

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,370
premature death so before I go any

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,030
further

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,799
I've a disclaimer this is probably the

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,540
only software talk you'll ever hear with

00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:35,640
a disclaimer although i don't know Jim's

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,319
talk on drones might might should have

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,580
had one but but I'll put these slides on

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,500
the web please go take a look at this

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,360
the too long didn't read version though

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,120
is take everything i say with a grain of

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,549
salt and use your best judgment because

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,200
i'm not a doctor and even if i were a

00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:54,750
doctor you shouldn't take my word at

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,390
face value every one of you has unique

00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,060
concerns related to your medical history

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,260
family history injury history and you

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,989
need to weigh those carefully when

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,129
making decisions about your health

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:08,190
what's right for you may not be right

00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:11,670
for someone else and vice versa now well

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,500
I'm not a doctor I am a programmer so

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,659
I'm familiar with the challenges that we

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,909
all face on a daily basis when it comes

00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,920
to taking care of our health I'm

00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:22,530
primarily a ruby developer I'm very

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,940
active in the JRuby community a core

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,239
committer on torque box and a number

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,230
number of other JRuby projects but

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,419
throughout my career I've been

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,120
interested in the health topics that

00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,130
relate to being sedentary and about a

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,870
year ago I decided that I wanted to

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,940
create a book called the healthy

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,950
programmer and so I started doing

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,859
research and actually consulting with

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,150
doctors scientists researchers

00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:46,970
nutritionists physical educators

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,500
physical therapists and many others and

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,930
what I've created i think is a unique

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,720
approach to health and fitness for

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,329
people who write code and i cover a wide

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,250
array of topics but today i'll focus on

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,959
those that are related to exercise and

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,889
how it affects our brain and our ability

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:09,900
to do our job so I'd like to begin with

00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:10,769
a story about Ohio Wow don't say

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,739
anything because you might know the

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,629
answers all right so Ohio sort of like

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,120
Texas is not particularly known for

00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:21,239
being a healthy place but there is one

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,830
part of ohio its Holmes County it's in

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,590
the middle about where the second oh and

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,510
Ohio is and by some measures Holmes

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,000
County maybe the healthiest place in

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,520
America a recent study done there on

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,860
26,000 people more than half the

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,020
county's population found that the rate

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,310
of cancer was an astonishing seventy-two

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,950
percent lower than the national

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,390
average and another study on a similar

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,280
group found that there were almost no

00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:46,140
incidents of heart disease type 2

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,080
diabetes or obesity related health

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,820
issues almost none again very different

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,380
from the national average but also

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,140
different from even the surrounding

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:58,410
counties so what's going on in this part

00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,060
of ohio well I've intentionally withheld

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,400
an important piece of information from

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,700
you all the participants in these

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,750
studies were Amish and in fact these

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,760
studies were done in Holmes County

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,940
because it has the largest Amish

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,830
population in the United States now if

00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,060
you're familiar with the Amish or if

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,830
you've seen the movie witness then then

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,860
you know that Amish societies embrace

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,900
hard physical labor they're typically

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,410
agrarian and they have a reluctance to

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,280
adopt new technology so basically it's

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:35,100
the exact opposite of being a programmer

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,890
while we while we sit all day in front

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,600
of Apple's latest invention the typical

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,540
Amish farmer is out in the fields

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,900
working very hard in fact the average

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,120
Amish farmer does about 52 hours per

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,240
week of moderate to vigorous physical

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,660
activity a week that's more than I get

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,520
in a month and I'm pretty active the

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,970
average Amish farmer also walks about

00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,160
nine miles every day except Sunday which

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,680
equates to a little less than 19,000

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,900
steps per day you know how many steps

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,500
per day you take or you nomming steps

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,240
per day the average programmer takes a

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,000
number of studies suggest that it's a

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,830
little north of 4,000 steps per day so

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,890
just a shadow of what these farmers take

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,990
and it turns out that this difference in

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,820
step count is one of the primary factors

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,310
leading to the different health profiles

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,290
between these two communities now there

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,930
are a number of other factors like

00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:34,260
smoking habits and diet and what not but

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,850
step count is important now i'm not

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,310
going to advocate that you become Amish

00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,230
to become healthy but you do probably

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,090
need to take more steps and certainly a

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,890
number of studies have shown that people

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,890
who work in professions that require

00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,360
them to walk more tend to be healthier

00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,390
jobs like custodians and restaurant

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,660
servers one of the first studies the to

00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,480
show

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,210
this was done in 1950 by british british

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,560
physician named Jeremy Morris and dr.

00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,790
Morris was simply trying to understand

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,380
if there were different life

00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,260
expectancies associated with different

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,300
jobs so he began a study on

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,920
double-decker bus drivers and conductors

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,120
on those big iconic red buses in London

00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,370
and what he found was that the

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,350
conductor's who walked around all day

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,270
collecting tickets and very often went

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,160
up and down those stairs were

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,780
significantly less likely to develop or

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,700
die from heart disease than the

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,760
sedentary bus drivers who SAT most of

00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,320
the day he extended his research to mail

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,030
carriers that walked their routes and

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,030
those that did not and he found the

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,280
exact same results now dr. Morris's

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,940
research was the very first of its kind

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,440
before 1950 many people suspected that

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,270
exercise was good for your health but we

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,520
had no scientific evidence connecting

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,020
the two and today of course we have a

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,060
wealth of evidence and we understand

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,010
this clearly and we all we have case

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,690
studies like dr. Morris's but we also

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,810
have specific laboratory experiments

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,300
that explain how certain aspects of

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,620
exercise affect our health one of those

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,540
studies that's relevant to this

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:06,150
discussion was done in Japan in 2007 the

00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,680
researchers took 246 sedentary adults

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,620
these are people who were not doing any

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,030
form of exercise prior to the study they

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,830
were enrolled in a five-month walking

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,330
program in which they supplemented their

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,980
daily routine with just a little bit of

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,530
walking some of it slow some of the

00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,450
brisk and after those five months the

00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,040
researchers found that the participants

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,930
had increased their physical fitness as

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,660
measured by aerobic capacity and thigh

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,340
muscle strength by twenty percent it had

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,380
significant drops in blood pressure and

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,560
it also reduced their lifestyle related

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,500
diseases things like type 2 diabetes and

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,250
heart disease by another twenty percent

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:43,530
all of this just from walking so that

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,550
brings us to the first activity that I

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,030
want you to take away from this

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:50,430
discussion walk more specifically you

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:53,310
should be getting 10,000 steps every day

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,780
if you don't have a pedometer get one

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,130
find out how many steps you're taking

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,410
you can get a pedometer on your phone

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,050
and get a Fitbit all sorts of great

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,730
things after a while you'll learn what

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,080
it feels like to take 10,000 steps and

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,790
you won't rely on the device and

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,850
more and I think what you'll discover is

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,040
that very small changes to your daily

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,460
routines can have a profound effect on

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,840
this number so try parking intentionally

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,400
in the back of the parking lot instead

00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,800
of circling the front looking for the

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,200
best spot that can be as much as a

00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,300
thousand steps right there try taking

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,340
the stairs instead of the elevator in

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,520
fact I challenge you to never take an

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,470
elevator again it's possible now the

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,610
great thing about the stairs is that it

00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,500
requires a little bit more effort than

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,030
walking on flat ground and that's

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,560
important because some of your daily

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,260
step count needs to come at a higher

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,030
intensity level specifically you need to

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,100
get your heart rate to fifty to sixty

00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,860
percent of its maximum and the rule of

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,530
thumb of the CDC uses for this is 1,000

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,000
steps in a 10-minute period so a brisk

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,100
walk enough to get you breathing a

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,510
little heavy but not sweat or need to

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,570
change your clothes it's the equivalent

00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:59,040
of walking stairs and in total you need

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,550
at least 20 minutes of that level of

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,890
moderate activity every day now 20

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,990
minutes is not an arbitrary number the

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,360
best science we have tells us that after

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,330
the first 20 minutes of daily moderate

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,690
exercise your risk of disease and a

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,160
premature death drops dramatically a

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,890
continued exercise beyond 20 minutes 30

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,690
minutes an hour is good for you but to

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,280
the dismay of my ironman triathlete

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,590
friends it's sort of a diminishing

00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,260
return if that initial difference

00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:31,470
between doing nothing and 20 minutes of

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,410
moderate walking every day that can have

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,290
the biggest impact on your health here's

00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,780
the best part you don't have to do it

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,240
all at once in fact a number of studies

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,250
have shown that spreading exercise

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,960
throughout your day might actually be

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,930
better for you than doing it in one lump

00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,580
sum so going for a five minute walk in

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,650
the morning a five minute brisk walk at

00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,300
lunch and a ten minute brisk walk in the

00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:58,530
evening might be better for you than

00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,800
that 30-minute trip to the gym in fact I

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:03,360
would argue that walking is this walking

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,070
periodically throughout the day is the

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,230
single best thing you can do for your

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,390
body but it's also one of the best

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,850
things you can do for your mind as i

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:15,450
said before exercise even as simple as

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:17,430
walking improves your cognition it does

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,899
this in two ways the first

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,790
that it gets your blood flowing faster

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,620
which increases oxygen and glucose

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,779
levels in the brain essentially feeding

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,310
your brain more rapidly and this

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,420
provides a short-term improvement to

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:30,930
higher-level thinking things like

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,820
problem solving skills and cognition the

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,740
second way is that it promotes the

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,029
production of proteins that strengthen

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,520
neural chemical connections in your

00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:42,810
brain and that actually improves your

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:45,510
memory so the mechanism behind this is a

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,459
protein called BDNF which has been

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,080
dubbed miracle-gro for the brain by one

00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:52,350
of the researchers I referenced in my

00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,209
book this protein is produced in your

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,160
brain and it binds to the receptors in

00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,870
the synapses between neurons and what

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,190
does this it effectively increases the

00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,070
voltage of those connections and

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:05,010
improves their signal strength if your

00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:07,440
brain is electric after all in addition

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,330
that it activates genes inside of those

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,950
neurons which promotes their growth

00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:14,130
protects them from stress and actually

00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:16,290
promotes the production of more bdnf in

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,870
fact scientists in the laboratory can

00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,910
apply bdnf to neurons in a petri dish

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,130
and watch them sprout new structural

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,830
branches so this is very powerful stuff

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:28,770
and it has a an amazing impact on her

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,450
brain and on our memory now bdnf and its

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,390
effect on the brain was discovered a

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,730
little red decade ago and a Nobel Prize

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:38,370
was awarded for that and shortly after

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:41,370
that a number of other studies emerged

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,230
studying bdnf and one of those found

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,720
that mice running on a spinning wheel

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,209
produce more bdnf in their brain than

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,880
mice that sit around and that study was

00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:52,820
seminal because it led to an explosion

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,880
of scientific research connecting

00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,950
exercise to cognition and humans we've

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,079
now learned that people learn vocabulary

00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,930
words twenty percent better after a

00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,850
single bout of exercise we've also

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,740
learned that people memorize strings of

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,860
letters more accurately after a single

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,320
bob of exercise and studies like that

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,000
tell us how exercise in bdnf improve our

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,010
memory but as I said it also improves

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
our higher level thinking and

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:22,620
specifically cognitive flexibility so

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,029
cognitive flexibility is a brain

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,120
function that allows us to shift

00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:28,500
thinking between different concepts so

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,579
to demonstrate this if I were to give

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,110
you the name of a common object

00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:34,660
and asked you to think of alternative

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:37,600
uses for it for example I might say a

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,699
newspaper and you would think I can roll

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,369
it up and swat a fly with it I can potty

00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:45,339
train a dog with it I can wrap dishes up

00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:46,540
and for packing or moving each time you

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:48,480
shift your thinking between those

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,910
different concepts you're using your

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,799
your cognitive flexibility so it turns

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:55,239
out this type of brain function plays a

00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,489
very important role in the creative

00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:58,389
problem-solving process and I don't

00:13:57,489 --> 00:14:00,399
think I need to tell you that the

00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:04,119
problem solving process is a big part of

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:06,279
what we do as programmers so a recent

00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:08,470
study used a test just like I described

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,089
gave participants a number of different

00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,089
common objects and asked them to think

00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:15,040
of alternative uses the researchers then

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:17,319
had half of the participants watch a

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,119
movie and the other half run or walk on

00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:22,029
a treadmill at sixty percent of their

00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:23,619
maximum heart rate after 35 minutes all

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,989
the participants were tested again with

00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:27,429
a new set of common objects and what

00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:29,829
they found was that the movie watching

00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,449
group performed at the same level after

00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:33,489
the movie as they had before they were

00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:35,169
the control group while the treadmill

00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:37,179
group performs significantly better

00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:39,869
after the exercise that is they were

00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:42,309
able to think of more alternative uses

00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:45,669
so with this study and many others like

00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:47,829
it suggests is that going for a walk or

00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:50,350
getting some exercise before debugging

00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:53,709
some code might help you identify and

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,869
solve problems better or maybe going for

00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:58,449
a walk or getting your blood flowing

00:14:55,869 --> 00:15:01,149
before a pair of programming session or

00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:04,629
a code review might help you get the

00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:06,459
most out of it now other studies have

00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:08,649
shown that exercise after learning

00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:12,699
something new also helps you retain

00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:14,049
those new memories so the next time you

00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:16,929
learn about a new programming language

00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:19,179
feature or watch a video of a talk like

00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:20,589
this go for a walk and you'll be

00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,410
strengthening those connections that

00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:25,149
you've recently created in your brain

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,819
now that is actually led some

00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:30,399
researchers to theorize that the reason

00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:32,980
riding a bicycle is such a profoundly

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,839
permanent memory is that when we learn

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,299
to ride a bike we're creating this sort

00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:39,910
of perfect stew in our brain where we're

00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:44,560
creating new neurons and new synapses

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:47,260
and at the same time we're getting

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,620
robic activity that is producing bdnf

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:53,260
and strengthening those connections and

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,940
that might leave you wondering shouldn't

00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,540
I just walk all day isn't that the way

00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,980
to get the most out of my brain and yeah

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,800
a number of studies have shown that

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,839
these walking treadmill desks are very

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,089
good for your health the problem is that

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,279
those same studies have shown that they

00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:10,720
reduce your desk dexterity and thus

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,390
reduce your productivity by about

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,760
fifteen percent that's important because

00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:19,900
all the things that I'm recommending you

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,970
do today all these activities they're

00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,980
intended not only to improve your health

00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,380
but also to make you a better programmer

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,200
so I don't typically advocate for the

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:31,000
use of these walking desks but if you

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,589
use one or if you want to use one or if

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,480
you like them then by all means do it

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:37,510
they're good for you but they're not

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,730
necessarily right for everybody likewise

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,760
standing desks may not be right for

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,339
everyone in fact no one should stand all

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,680
day long standing puts standing for long

00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,810
periods of time puts an excessive strain

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,250
on your circulatory system and that can

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,110
cause problems with your arteries it can

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,030
cause varicose veins and it can even

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,520
cause blood clots which of course can be

00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:00,100
lethal in fact if you're predisposed to

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,570
developing a blood clot because you

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,670
smoke you're pregnant you have high

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,439
blood pressure or family history of

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,530
blood clots then you probably shouldn't

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,089
use a standing desk at all now despite

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,339
those concerns a number of researchers

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:15,069
and experts do advocate for the use of

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:17,020
standing desks but only in shorter

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,380
intervals about 20 minutes at a time

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,630
before taking a break the reason these

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,850
experts like standing desks well there's

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,220
several reasons the first is that it

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:28,990
increases your caloric expenditure so

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,380
you burn about 50 extra calories per

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,730
hour standing as compared to sitting now

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,590
that's probably not significant enough

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,530
to help you lose large amounts of weight

00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,090
but it has been shown to be enough to

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,510
help you maintain weight loss after

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:45,100
reaching a particular goal another

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,840
reason these experts like standing desks

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,120
is that they promote higher levels of

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,890
physical activity studies done with

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,150
students working from standing desks

00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,880
have shown that they are more likely to

00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:57,550
move around and just walk away from the

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,540
desk when they're standing and just

00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,580
generally have a higher

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,620
level of physical activity and that

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,480
shouldn't be undervalued that small

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,930
amount of movement can have a big impact

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,340
on your metabolism but the most

00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,900
important thing about standing and

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,520
ultimately the reason that I do

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,220
recommend you use a standing desk

00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,410
periodically throughout your day is that

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,240
you won't be sitting and that's

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,910
important because sitting is not the

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,490
metabolic equivalent of breaking even

00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:27,400
sitting is killing us now that may sound

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:29,980
brash or overstated but the fact is

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,600
there is a ton of science that connects

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,350
the time you spend sitting in your life

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,060
to your mortality one of the most

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,640
significant studies was published in

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:42,520
2009 it was done over a 12-year period

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,930
on 17,000 Canadians after the

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,150
researchers adjusted for things like

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,010
diet age smoking habits physical

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,410
activity levels they found that the

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,180
participants who SAT the most were fifty

00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,930
percent more likely to die prematurely

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,310
from any cause what's most important

00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,160
about this study is that it was

00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,960
controlled for physical activity levels

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,480
what that means is the people who were

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,950
getting 20 or 30 minutes of exercise or

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,930
going to the gym for 40 minutes a day

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,720
we're still more likely to die

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,080
prematurely if they SAT the remaining 10

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,360
to 15 hours a day that is to say sitting

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:21,310
can actually counteract the benefits of

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:24,310
exercise another study published in 2012

00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,660
over a four-year period on 222,000

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,440
Australians found essentially the same

00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,760
results I could literally go on all day

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,770
referencing studies like this that link

00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,450
sitting to your mortality sitting to

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,960
heart disease sitting 2 diabetes sitting

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:40,270
even to cancer clearly sitting is not

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,160
good for us but as i said earlier

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,680
standing all day is not good for us

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,230
either so what is the best position to

00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,420
work from it turns out the best position

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,440
to work from is whatever position you

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,440
are not currently in

00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:57,570
changing positions is essential to your

00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:59,429
health and when you think about it in

00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,450
terms of human evolution it makes sense

00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:06,240
we've evolved to be moving creatures and

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,830
sitting in staying in any one position

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,529
for an extended period of time is simply

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:13,740
unnatural for us I want you to imagine

00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:15,840
for a second prehistoric man out on the

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,600
Savannah sitting in a comfortable office

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,320
chair he he's going to get eaten really

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,600
quick so movement has evolved our bodies

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,330
have evolved to move as a survival

00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,860
mechanism running away from prey a

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,559
running for prey running away from

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:34,019
predators it's how we survive in fact

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,789
that kind of thinking combined with all

00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:37,950
this science that relates exercise to

00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,529
the brain has led to advances in the

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,539
field of anthropology a group of

00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:44,730
researchers recently discovered that the

00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:47,460
animal species with the hyatt highest

00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:50,220
endurance capacity primarily rats dogs

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,220
and humans also have the highest brain

00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,710
to body size ratio and it led those

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,539
researchers to hypothesize that the

00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,460
human brain evolved not based on

00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:01,980
criteria associated associated with

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,450
intelligence but he evolved based on

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,119
criteria associated with physical

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:08,399
activity that is to say running after

00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,999
pray may be responsible for our superior

00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:14,309
brain and you may have heard of these

00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:16,289
Indian tribes in Mexico that hunt their

00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:18,149
prey by running it to death and we're

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:21,269
one of the few species that's capable of

00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:22,740
that because of our aerobic capacity now

00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:25,289
I'm not going to advocate that you run

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,049
your food to death but you do need to

00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:30,480
move more specifically five minutes out

00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:32,700
of every hour studies have shown that a

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,190
five minute break from sitting or or

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,350
whatever every hour just five minutes of

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,259
movement can actually counteract the

00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:42,539
negative consequences of sitting so

00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:44,850
getting up and going to the bathroom can

00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,559
be good for your health or the next time

00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,990
you need to send an email to one of your

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,700
co-workers get up walk down the hall and

00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:53,399
go talk to that person you'll get some

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,749
of your step count that way too if you

00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:57,539
absolutely cannot get away from your

00:21:54,749 --> 00:22:00,509
desk try doing some exercises from your

00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:02,309
chair you know little leg extensions or

00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:03,310
overhead claps I like doing these while

00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:06,110
I read my email

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,960
the the important thing is that you'll

00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,400
be getting your muscles to contract

00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,870
that's important because when your

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,470
muscles don't contract for long periods

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:17,360
of time gene activity starts to change

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,640
at a cellular level so when you're

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,850
sitting for two three four hours love

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,790
ever getting up so five minutes every

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:28,070
hour but in addition to that you need to

00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,600
change position every 20 minutes you

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,880
don't have to stop working or leave your

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,740
desk just if you've been sitting for 20

00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,240
minutes stand up if you've been standing

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,210
for 20 minutes sit down constantly

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,590
moving in fact I use a timer to help me

00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:43,520
do this and I'll talk more about that

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,710
later on now changing positions every 20

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,200
minutes is good for your metabolism but

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,340
it's also good for another aspect of

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,270
your health that I haven't addressed yet

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:57,170
and that is pain and truly to be healthy

00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:00,170
you have to be relatively pain-free now

00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:02,990
how many of you have had back neck or

00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,460
wrist pain in the last year that was

00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:08,690
significant enough to interfere with

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:10,550
your ability to do your job well yeah a

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,110
number of studies suggest that eighty

00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,540
percent of people who work at a computer

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:18,230
have had that kind of pain in the last

00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,910
year and I think it's programmers we're

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,280
sort of uniquely predisposed to this

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,710
because in addition to the eight nine

00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,630
hours a day at work we often come home

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:29,090
and continue to work on a computer and

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:32,420
we do this not only because we love what

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:34,880
we do but also because in order to hone

00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,220
our craft or improve our skills we have

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,310
to practice so we sit in front of these

00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,810
machines and practice all day long but

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,480
we're not the first people to have that

00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:47,030
problem in fact penis have had that

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,190
problem for over 500 years and in that

00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,500
time they've come to reject the notion

00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,720
that a life of pain is required to

00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,120
master their instruments and hopefully

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,010
we'll get to that point too now this

00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,450
wasn't always true for pianists in the

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,570
early days of the harpsichord in the

00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:05,240
organ it was believed that pain was just

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:09,200
a part of the job but that all began to

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,970
change in 1735 when CPE Bach published

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,520
an essay on the true art of playing

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,320
keyboard instruments and in this essay

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,700
Bach was the first to address many of

00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,890
the fingering and position

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,540
issues that had confused keyboard

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:24,620
players for over a century up to that

00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:26,900
point since box time those ideas have

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,120
been refined and improved upon to the

00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,030
point that at schools like Juilliard and

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,380
the Royal College of Music in London

00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:36,350
posture and techniques for movement are

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,330
part of the curriculum in fact in doing

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,650
the research for my book I interviewed a

00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,180
musician who studied at the Royal

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:43,130
College of Music in London and learn

00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,860
many of these techniques and today he

00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:48,190
teaches them to musicians singers and

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,440
even computer users in the United States

00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:54,980
one of the things I learned from him is

00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:57,050
that your position your posture is very

00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,240
individual we all have subtle

00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,920
differences in our proportions the

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,290
length of our arm and its ratio to our

00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,450
torso and those all come into play when

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,400
setting up your workstation so it's

00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,130
important to experiment with your with

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,990
your set up in fact this expert even

00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,940
recommends using mirrors and video

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:17,030
cameras so you can watch yourself work

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,100
how you sit how you move now despite

00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,810
that individual app individuality there

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,210
there are a few heuristics you can

00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:26,090
follow to sort of get the best or an

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,440
8020 solution the first rule is that

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,390
your elbows should always be level with

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,280
your wrist this is actually true whether

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,750
you're sitting or standing I see too

00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,240
many people working from a standing desk

00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,740
that's about this height and creates a

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,230
negative bend in the wrist which is a

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,350
great way to induce wrist pain they'll

00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,760
also help with neck and shoulder pain

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,460
the next rule is that your monitor

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,890
should be eye level and 20 to 40 inches

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,350
from your eyes so if you're standing you

00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,990
may need to raise it up to test the

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,430
distance your arm is about 20 inches

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,840
long so when you're sitting in front of

00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,430
your computer try reaching out in front

00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,900
of you if you can touch the screen

00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,360
you'll probably need to move a little

00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,340
further away this will help with neck

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,170
pain would also help with ice train and

00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,610
computer vision syndrome which is the

00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,550
leading cause of headaches for people

00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,720
who work at a computer the next rule is

00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,960
that your feet should always be

00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,490
supported this is true whether obviously

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,140
if you're standing but also if you're

00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,790
sitting they shouldn't dangle off the

00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,770
end of the chair so you may need to use

00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:24,710
a footrest to prop them up once you

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,810
achieve the right chair height and you

00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,950
should adjust the height of that

00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:30,140
footrest so that your hips are level

00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,360
with your knees

00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,010
now the positioning of your lower body

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,200
is not actually related to lower body

00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,960
pain instead it's related to back pain

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,270
and that's because of muscles like the

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,520
psoas which connects to your lumbar

00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,560
spine travels through your pelvis and

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,260
attaches to your femur your upper leg I

00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,930
mean this muscle becomes stiff or your

00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,970
leg is stretched in a way that causes it

00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:54,650
to pull on the lumbar spine it can

00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:58,130
actually create a sensation that's often

00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:59,480
mistaken for a herniated disc but the

00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,820
sohus isn't the only muscle thats

00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,710
related to back pain in fact all of the

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,050
muscles in your trunk their purpose is

00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,660
to support your spine and no matter how

00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,460
good your posture is if you're working

00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,930
at a computer all day and not using

00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,420
these muscles they will gradually

00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,680
decondition and essentially atrophy just

00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,350
like the muscles of an astronaut in

00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,940
space and just as with astronauts it

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,860
doesn't take a very long amount of time

00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,960
before these muscles weaken to the point

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,240
that they can only support the spine for

00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,950
a few minutes and when that happens you

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,400
start to slouch and that's what causes

00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:33,650
eighty percent of acute and chronic

00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,710
nonspecific lower back pain it's widely

00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:39,350
agreed among doctors scientists

00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:43,400
therapists that exercise is the most

00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:45,410
effective treatment for back pain one of

00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,930
the leading researchers in this area in

00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:51,320
fact the leading researcher in the world

00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:53,900
is dr. Stuart MacGill at the University

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,640
of Waterloo in Canada dr. McGill has

00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,500
this laboratory with electromagnetic

00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,910
tracking equipment that he hooks up to

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,820
people so they look like Frankenstein

00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:04,760
and then he has them do these exercises

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:07,130
specific exercises what he's testing for

00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,900
is the FOC of each exercise and once to

00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,810
see what muscles are activated and how

00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,010
it strains different parts of your body

00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:15,020
one of the things he's discovered in his

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,360
research is that the exercises that

00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,160
improve the health of your back are not

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,950
necessarily the same as the exercises

00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,750
that improve the athletic performance so

00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,420
the exercises that he recommends for

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:30,140
desk jockeys are not the same as those

00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:32,410
who recommends for martial artists when

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,030
we sit at a computer we need stability

00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:38,390
while martial artists wrestlers they

00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,540
need dynamic strength and movement you

00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,560
probably didn't make this distinction

00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,789
when you were growing up so you learned

00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,600
exercises like the

00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:49,850
sit up which are terrible for your back

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,519
dr. McGill has three exercises that he

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:54,499
calls the big three that are designed to

00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:58,850
improve the health of your lower back

00:28:54,499 --> 00:29:01,249
and thus reduce back pain the first

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,690
exercise is a side bridge it's like

00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:05,690
something you might see in a Pilates

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:07,759
program you hold this position for seven

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,029
to eight seconds relax repeat a few

00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:13,340
times and then change sides the second

00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:16,669
exercise is the bird dog similar to a

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:19,309
tiger pose in yoga from all fours you

00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:21,409
extend a posing arm and leg hold for

00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:25,249
seven to eight seconds relax repeat a

00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:27,859
few times change sides the last exercise

00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:31,190
is a curl up which is a sort of modified

00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:32,989
version of the half sit up this exercise

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,549
has become so uniquely associated with

00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:37,129
dr. mcgills program that it's often

00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:38,720
called the McGill curl up what's

00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:40,909
different about this exercise first is

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,609
that you have one leg straight and one

00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:46,190
leg bent you then place your hands below

00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:48,169
your lower back curl up curl your

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,599
shoulders off the ground hold for seven

00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:54,979
to eight seconds relax repeat a few

00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:56,269
times switch your legs and continue the

00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:58,639
reason you put your hands below your

00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:59,929
lower back is to prevent your spine from

00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:02,269
flattening out when you curl your

00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:04,580
shoulders up that's important because

00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:06,529
all of these exercises are designed to

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,109
improve the strength and stability of

00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:11,450
your core muscles without flexing your

00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:15,950
spine because flexing your spine is

00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:18,190
actually what leads to more back pain so

00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:21,529
that brings us to the next activity

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,379
build strength dr. McGill argues that

00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:26,419
most people should do these exercises

00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:28,519
every day and you can also supplement

00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:31,669
them with other strength exercises like

00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,799
push-ups or the Hindu squat the idea is

00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:35,840
to use your muscles and keep them

00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:37,279
conditioned regularly these are not

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,989
explosive strength training exercises

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,090
they're classified as therapeutic

00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:44,419
exercises so you can do them every day

00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,889
and just as with your walking you don't

00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:48,259
have to do them all at once and in fact

00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:51,080
it may be better for you to spread them

00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:53,659
throughout your day one method that i

00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,870
like to use for this is what I call the

00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:57,270
Pomodoro workout

00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:00,210
is anybody familiar with the Pomodoro

00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:03,630
Technique anybody use the Pomodoro

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:05,220
Technique alright so the Pomodoro

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,710
workout is based on the Pomodoro

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,200
Technique the Pomodoro Pomodoro is

00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:11,730
Spanish for tomato the pomodoro

00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,670
technique is a personal productivity

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:18,690
model in which you set a timer for 20

00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:21,390
minutes you you then start working on a

00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,760
specific task focus focus exclusively on

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,830
that task for the next 20 minutes when

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,080
the timer goes off you stop working on

00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:30,660
the task take a five-minute break and

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,190
then repeat this improves your

00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,740
productivity in a couple different ways

00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,630
the first is that by time boxing the

00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,820
period in which you focus it allows you

00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,670
to concentrate more intensely and avoid

00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,230
distraction so most people that use this

00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:47,010
technique advocate turning off Twitter

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,450
Email everything for that 20 minutes the

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,790
second way it improves productivity is

00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,860
by sort of eliminating the fear of

00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:55,350
failure that often paralyzes us from

00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,860
ever getting started too often when I'm

00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,880
confronted with a bug or a task I

00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,559
hesitate to begin because I start

00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,000
thinking too far ahead I think about the

00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:06,300
big picture and all the problems I'm

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,830
going to encounter and I never start but

00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,150
instead by focusing on 20 minute

00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:12,660
intervals and just ensuring that I

00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:16,160
concentrate and makes small steady

00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:18,150
progress I'm able to be more productive

00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,340
now where I've improved upon this

00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:23,460
technique is in that five-minute break

00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:25,920
period if you do a pomodoro workout

00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,960
instead of surfing the web or checking

00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,000
your email for five minutes you get up

00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,950
and out of your chair maybe you go for a

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,410
five minute brisk walk or do some curl

00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,150
ups or some Hindu squats you get your

00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,070
blood flowing you increase oxygen and

00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,740
glucose levels in your brain you get a

00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,270
short-term improvement to cognition

00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,650
problem-solving skills and memory and

00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,230
when you return to your desk you're

00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:48,570
refreshed your mind is turned on and

00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,520
it's ready to go and you'll get the most

00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:54,870
out of that next twenty minute interval

00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:57,120
I think what you'll find after just a

00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:59,100
few iterations of the Pomodoro Pomodoro

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,380
workout in the morning you can actually

00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,020
complete a full day's worth of work all

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,910
before lunch and doing all these

00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,950
activities that I'm recommending you you

00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:10,360
do every day

00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:13,029
the reason the pomodoro workout is so

00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,029
powerful is that it provides structure

00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:18,700
for your exercise because without

00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:21,340
structure it's it's difficult to create

00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,509
new healthy habits that God structure

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,450
it's difficult to create any kind of

00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:28,240
habit and no one understands is better

00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:30,269
than Chad Fowler and as part of the

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,049
research for my book in addition to

00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:34,450
consulting with doctors and experts

00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:36,669
health experts I interviewed a number of

00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,440
programmers and one of them was Chad who

00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:42,659
has a personal success story of losing

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:45,159
about a hundred pounds in a year and

00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,350
Chad was extremely generous with his

00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:49,149
time and he allowed me to pry into his

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,070
personal life because I was hoping to

00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:54,100
uncover what it was that made him

00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:56,830
successful and in talking with him at

00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:59,230
one point I said something like well

00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:01,720
there's no magic and he quickly replied

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,929
yes there is the magic is having a

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,120
system Chad knew that if he took a

00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:10,659
chaotic approach to turning his life

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,310
around that it wouldn't work he needed a

00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:15,099
structured system that he could follow

00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:18,520
and I think that's true for all of us in

00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:20,169
making any kind of change so tools like

00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,060
the Pomodoro workout provides some

00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:23,829
structure but really you need to

00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,950
structure your entire day you need a

00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:28,119
plan and that's the final activity I

00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:31,089
want you to take away from this talk

00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,369
plan every day every morning when you

00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:35,919
wake up try asking yourself three

00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:37,960
questions what did i do yesterday for my

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:40,060
health what will I do today for my

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,609
health and is there anything blocking me

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,250
from being healthy so the first question

00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:47,440
is obviously one of introspection and I

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,240
think it helps you to recognize your

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,730
progress because changes to your health

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,190
happen over long periods of time so

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,770
looking at the day to day progress is

00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:58,060
important the second question is of

00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,400
course the most important what are you

00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:03,609
going to do next what exercises will you

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,190
do we go for a walk when will you do

00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:09,849
those things and in addition to the

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,800
specific exercises and activities you

00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:14,530
should also try to achieve one new

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,359
personal record every day try to do

00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,650
something every day or aim to do

00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:19,970
something every day that you've never

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:22,010
done before it doesn't have to be big

00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,750
maybe did one more push up than you've

00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,420
ever done before or taken ten more steps

00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,040
than ever before or maybe you avoided

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,990
dipping into the office candy bowl for

00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,970
the first time whatever it is try to

00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,290
find some quantifiable nugget of

00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:36,230
improvement that you can aim to achieve

00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:38,390
I called it a sort of Kaizen approach to

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,160
health as I said changes to your health

00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:42,320
especially losing weight take a very

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,810
long amount of time months and even

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,640
years to become permanent so instead of

00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:51,250
focusing on the big dramatic changes

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:53,390
focus on slow small incremental progress

00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,460
finally is there anything blocking you

00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,630
from being healthy does your desk not

00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,750
allow you to work from a standing

00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:02,210
position if so change it do your shoes

00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,220
hurt your feet when you walk if so get

00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,690
new shoes try to find the things that

00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:12,740
are blocking you from being healthy and

00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:14,090
change them so let's recap the first

00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,250
activity I want you to take away from

00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,840
this talk and I'd like you to do every

00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:21,080
day from this day forward is to walk

00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:23,720
more get 10,000 steps every day 20

00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,700
minutes of that briskly the second

00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,130
activity is to move five minutes out of

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:32,240
every hour never sit for more than one

00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:35,270
hour without getting up I also changed

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,880
positions every 20 minutes the third

00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:41,660
activity is to build strength daily you

00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,790
a few of those big three exercises do

00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,490
some push-ups some Hindu squats mix them

00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:48,500
into a pomodoro workout and then finally

00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:53,839
plan your day ask yourself those three

00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:56,150
questions every morning to keep track of

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,460
these you can use the healthy program or

00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:01,010
iPhone app it's a companion app to my

00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:03,589
book it's free it has a checklist of

00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:06,560
these items it has a Pomodoro timer a

00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:08,089
list of exercises a logbook it's a

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,380
little bit out of sync with this talk

00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:13,520
right now because I'm waiting on an app

00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:17,510
store review but it'll the update will

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,280
come soon now the app is useful without

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:22,010
my book but i believe it is more useful

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,720
with my book and you can find out more

00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:28,550
about my book at healthy prague com i

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,400
cover these activities and many other

00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,880
topics in much greater detail the other

00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,800
topics include

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,290
vitamin D synthesis I would be willing

00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,910
to bet that everybody in this room has a

00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,580
vitamin D deficiency because we do not

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:44,560
get enough sunlight exposure I also

00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:50,260
cover carpal tunnel syndrome headaches

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:54,040
and many other things now I'd like to

00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:57,370
conclude my talk by not taking questions

00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,950
i knows a little unconventional but what

00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:05,250
i want to do is encourage you to talk to

00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:08,050
me and talk to other people I think I

00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,360
think we have a health problem in our

00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,190
lives and in order to change that we

00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,250
have to confront it and the best way to

00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:17,080
do that is to talk about it so approach

00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:20,200
me tonight i'll be around i'm going to

00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,730
the github drinkup you don't you don't

00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,460
have to stop having fun to be healthy

00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:26,350
okay I'll be around tomorrow feel free

00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,570
to approach me and let's chat in

00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,520
addition in addition to me talk to other

00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:33,100
people talk to you the people here talk

00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,690
to your friends talk to your family the

00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,730
next time you have to make small talk

00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,930
with someone talk about instead of

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,790
talking about the weather talk about

00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,920
health and and what you learned today I

00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:48,370
think sharing those ideas is the best

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:52,450
way to create change I'm Joe Kutner I go

00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:54,730
by code finger on IRC and Twitter I hang

00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:59,730
out in JRuby and torque box channels and

00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,730
i'm the founder of logic house thank

00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,390
